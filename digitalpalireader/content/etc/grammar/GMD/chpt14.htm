<p align="center"><font size="4"><strong>A
Practical Grammar of the P&#257;li Language<br>
Chapter 14</strong></font></p>

<p><font color="#FF0000" size="4"><strong>Syntax
(K&#257;raka)</strong></font></p>

<p><font><strong>587.</strong> Syntax, in
P&#257;li, does not offer any difficulty for nearly all the
relations of the substantives, adjectives and pronouns which will
be explained in this chapter are very often obviated by
compounding them as has already been explained in the chapter on
Compounds. The student who has carefully read and mastered the
Compounds has therefore done much and will understand ordinary
prose without too much difficulty. However, there are peculiar
uses of the Cases, without a knowledge of which a thorough
mastery of the language would be impossible; we therefore invite
the learner to read attentively the present chapter.</font></p>

<p><font>(i) </font><font color="#0000FF"
size="4"><strong>Order of Sentences</strong></font></p>

<p><font><strong>588.</strong> The order of the
P&#257;li sentence is very simple in character, compound
sentences being rather the exception than the rule:</font></p>

<p><font>(1) Whether the sentence be Simple,
Compound or Complex, the predicate must always come last.</font></p>

<p><font>(2) In a simple sentence containing an
object, the order is: (i) Subject; (ii) object and (iii)
predicate, as: d&#257;so kamma</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> karoti, the slave
does the work.</font></p>

<p><font>(3) Words qualifying the subject or the
object come before the subject and the object respectively, and
adverbs before the verb: etetayo puris&#257; mahanta</font><font
size="3">&#7747;</font><font> siri</font><font
size="3">&#7747;</font><font> s&#299;gha</font><font
size="3">&#7747;</font><font>
p&#257;pu&#7751;i</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font>su, these three men quickly attained to great
glory.<br>
Remark. Adverbs of time always come first in the sentence.</font></p>

<p><font>(4) The conjunctions, pana, but;
ud&#257;hu, or, are used to form compound sentences; ce, yadi and
sace, if, complex sentences.</font></p>

<p><font>(ii) </font><font color="#0000FF"
size="4"><strong>The Article</strong></font></p>

<p><font><strong>589.</strong> There are no words
in P&#257;li corresponding to the English articles; the words
eko, ekacce, one, a certain are often used in the sense of the
indefinite article (253); and so, eso, that, this, do the
function of the definite article: so puriso, the man; s&#257;
itth&#299;, the woman.</font></p>

<p><font>Remark. Substantives not preceded by the
above words may, according to the context, be translated as if
preceded by the articles: puriso=a man, or, the man.</font></p>

<p><font>(iii) </font><font color="#0000FF"
size="4"><strong>Concord</strong></font></p>

<p><font><strong>590.</strong> Concord of subject
and predicate.</font></p>

<p><font>(1) The predicate may be:<br>
(i) a finite verb: bhikkhu gahapati</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> ov&#257;di, the
monk admonished the householder;<br>
(ii) a substantive with the verb &quot;hoti&quot; understood
after it: yadi ete gu&#7751;&#257;, if these (are=honti) virtues;<br>
(iii)An adjective with &quot;hoti&quot; also understood: tva</font><font
size="3">&#7747;</font><font>
atib&#257;lo, thou (art=asi) very foolish;<br>
(iv) A P.P.P.used as a finite verb; so pi gato, he too went, lit.
he too gone.</font></p>

<p><font>(2) When a finite verb is used as
predicate, it must agree with the subject in number and person.
When there are several subjects of different persons, the verb is
put in the first person plural: so ca tva</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> aha</font><font
size="3">&#7747;</font><font>
gacchatha, he thou, and I go. Should there be no subject of the
first person, the verb is put in the 2nd person plural: so ca tva</font><font
size="3">&#7747;</font><font>
gacchatha, he and thou go.</font></p>

<p><font>(3) In the case of an adjective or a
P.P.P. taking the place of the predicate, the adj. and the P.P.P.
must agree with the subject in gender and number: so gato, he
went; s&#257; gat&#257;, she went; ta</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> gata</font><font
size="3">&#7747;</font><font>, it
went; so taru&#7751;o, he is young; s&#257; taru&#7751;&#257;, she is
young; ta</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> taru&#7751;a</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font>, it is young.</font></p>

<p><font>(4) But if a substantive stands in the
place of a verb, no such concord of gender or number needs take
place; appamado nibbanapada</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> (=nibb&#257;nassa pada</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font>o), vigilance is
the path to Nirvana.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FF0000"><strong>Concord of
Adjective and Substantive</strong></font></p>

<p><font><strong>591.</strong> An adjective, or
participle (which is of the nature of an adj.) when not
compounded with the noun it qualifies, must agree with it in
gender, number and case.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FF0000"><strong>Concord of the
Relative and its Antecedent</strong></font></p>

<p><font><strong>592.</strong> The relative must
agree with its antecedent in gender, number and person.</font></p>

<p><font>(1) The relative may be used by itself,
without the noun: yo jan&#257;ti so ima</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> ga&#7751;h&#257;tu, he
who knows let him take this. Note, that in the above the
demonstrative pronoun so is used as a correlative.</font></p>

<p><font>(2) The relative is used instead of a
preceding noun: aha</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> eka</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> up&#257;ya</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> jan&#257;mi, yena amhe ga&#7751;hitu</font><font
size="3">&#7747;</font><font> no
sakkissati, I know an expedient by which he will not able to
seize us.</font></p>

<p><font>(3) With the noun expressed: yassa
purisassa buddhi hoti so mahaddhano ti vuccati, to whom there is
wisdom, he is called very wealthy, he who has wisdom is said to
be very wealthy.</font></p>

<p><font>(4) Note that the clause containing the
relative is put first; sometimes the clause containing the
correlative is placed first for the sake of emphasis: na so
pit&#257;yena putto na sikkh&#257;piyati, he is no father by whom
the son is not made to learn.</font></p>

<p><font>(iv) </font><font color="#0000FF"
size="4"><strong>Syntax of Substantives</strong></font></p>

<p><font><strong>593.</strong> This is properly
government, for the term &quot;k&#257;raka&quot; expresses the
relation between the noun and the verb; so that any relation
existing between words not connected with a verb cannot be called
a k&#257;raka, consequently the Genitive and the Vocative are not
considered as cases, for they have no relation whatever with the
verb; they are therefore called ak&#257;raka, non-cases.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FF0000"><strong>1. The
Nominative</strong></font></p>

<p><font><strong>594.</strong> The Nominative is
used very much in the same way as in English; it is the subject
of the verb and the latter must agree with it in number and
person; see Concord of subject and predicate (590).</font></p>

<p><font>(i) The Nominative is used in
apposition: malliko kosalar&#257;j&#257;, Mallika, king of
Kosala.</font></p>

<p><font>(ii) It is used absolutely in titles of
books, that is, it does not take the termination proper to the
nominative; m&#257;haj&#257;nakaj&#257;taka, the birth.story of
Mahajanaka.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FF0000"><strong>2. Genitive</strong></font></p>

<p><font><strong>595.</strong> The true force of
the genitive is -of and -'s expressing possession.</font></p>

<p><font>(i) The genitive therefore is used
primarily to denote possession: suva&#7751;&#7751;assa r&#257;si, a heap of
gold; rukkhassa s&#257;kh&#257;, the branch of the tree.</font></p>

<p><font>(ii) In such examples as the above, the
genitive is often compounded with the noun it qualifies:
suva&#7751;&#7751;ar&#257;si.</font></p>

<p><font>(iii) It denotes the whole of which a
part only is taken; this is called &quot;partitive
genitive&quot;: br&#257;hm&#257;&#7751;a</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> so pa&#7751;&#7693;ito, he
is clever among brahmins; sabbayodh&#257;na</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> atis&#363;ro, the
bravest of all warriors; tumh&#257;ka</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> pana eken&#257;,
but even not one of you.</font></p>

<p><font>(iv) The genitive is used also with
words expressing, difference, equality, inequality: tassa antara</font><font
size="3">&#7747;</font><font> na passi</font><font
size="3">&#7747;</font><font>su, they
did not see the (its) difference; sadiso pitu, the same as (his)
father; tulyo pitu equal to his father.<br>
Remark. In these examples the ablative may also be used: sadiso
pitar&#257;.</font></p>

<p><font>(v) Words meaning. dear or the reverse,
take a genitive: s&#257; br&#257;hma&#7751;assa man&#257;p&#257;, she
(was) dear to the brahmin.</font></p>

<p><font>(vi) Likewise words denoting: honour,
veneration etc.: g&#257;massa p&#363;jito honoured of the village;
ra&#241;&#241;o m&#257;nito, revered by (of) the king.<br>
Remark. In these examples the Inst. may also be used: g&#257;mena
p&#363;jito.</font></p>

<p><font>(vii) Words of: skill, proficiency,
etc., and their opposites, govern the genitive: kusal&#257;
naccag&#299;tassa, clever in dancing and singing.</font></p>

<p><font>(viii) It is used with words indicating:
locality, time, distance: amh&#257;ka</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> buddhassa pubbe,
before our Buddha; g&#257;massa avidure, not far from the
village; upari tesa</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font>, above them.</font></p>

<p><font>(ix) Believing in or well disposed
towards: budhassa pasanno, he has faith in the Buddha.<br>
Remark. Here the Loc. may also be used: buddhe pasanno.</font></p>

<p><font>(x) It is used also with words of
remembering or thinking of (with sorrow), pitying, wishing for,
giving or apportioning, honouring, cleaning, filling, fearing and
a few others: m&#257;tussa sarati, he remembers his mother (with
sorrow); na tesa koci sarati, nobody remembers them; telassa
davati, he gives oil; p&#363;rati b&#257;lo p&#257;passa, the fool is
full of evil; sabbe tasanti da&#7751;&#7693;assa, all fear punishment.</font></p>

<p><font>In these examples the Acc. may be used:
tela</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> davati.<br>
Remark. Words of fearing also govern the Abl.: kin nu kho aha</font><font
size="3">&#7747;</font><font>
sunakh&#257; bh&#257;yami? Why should I fear the dog?</font></p>

<p><font>(xi) A genitive with a participle in
agreement is called a Gen. Absolute. It generally denotes some
attendant circumstance:<br>
tassa bhatta</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> bhuttassa udaka</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> aharanti, when he
had finished his meal they fetched him water.</font></p>

<p><font>(xii) Some other relations of the
genitive will present no difficulty, as they have their exact
parallel in English.</font></p>

<p><font><strong>596.</strong> It will be seen
from the remarks above that the genitive is often used instead of
the Accusative, the Ablative, the Instrumentive and the Locative.
It is also used adverbially, as kissa, why? It will also be
remarked that whenever the genitive is dependent on a verb, it is
so on account of its being used instead of another case, as in:
m&#257;tussa sarati.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FF0000"><strong>3. The Dative</strong></font></p>

<p><font><strong>597.</strong> The person or
object to or for whom, something is given or done, is put in the
Dative case. The Dat. is consequently used also as indirect
object with transitive verbs having an Acc. as direct object.</font></p>

<p><font>(i) The Dat., then, expresses the
relations which, in English, are usually denoted by the words to,
for: bhikkhussa civara</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> deti, he gives a robe to the priest;
yuddh&#257;ya paccuggacch&#257;mi; I will set out for battle.</font></p>

<p><font>(ii) The Dat. is governed by verbs
expressing praise or blame, anger, believing, disbelieving,
assent, envy, pleasure or displeasure, injury, benefit, approval,
forgiveness, salutation, blessing, hatred, abuse, concealing,
worshipping, carrying.</font></p>

<p><font>Examples: Buddhassa sil&#257;ghate, he
praises the Buddha; yadi'ha</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> tassa kuppeyya, if I should be angry with him;
duhayati dis&#257;na</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> ogho, the flood has injured the country; tuyha</font><font
size="3">&#7747;</font><font>
saddah&#257;mi, I believe thee; sv&#257;gata</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> te, hail to thee!
sotthi tuyha</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> hotu, fare thee well! khama me, forgive me!
mayha</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> sapate he swears at or, reviles me; tassa
sampa&#7789;icchi, he assented to it; ussuyanti dujjan&#257; gu&#7751;av
ant&#257;na</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> wicked people envy the virtuous; tassa at&#299;ta</font><font
size="3">&#7747;</font><font>
&#257;hari, he told him a story; dev&#257; pi tesa</font><font
size="3">&#7747;</font><font>
pihayanti, even the gods desire them, envy them; sama&#7751;assa
rocate sacca</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font>: truth pleases a monk.</font></p>

<p><font>(iii) The Dat. is commonly used with the
verb &quot;to be&quot; to express possession: putt&#257; me
n'atthi, no sons are to me, I have no sons.<br>
Remark. When the verb &quot;hoti&quot; is used with the Dat. to
express possession, it is generally put in the singular, even
when, as in the above example what is possessed is plural.</font></p>

<p><font>(iv) The word, ala</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font>, enough, fit,
governs the Dat.: ala</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> kukkucc&#257;ya, enough of doubt! ala</font><font
size="3">&#7747;</font><font> mallo
mallassa, sufficient is a warrior for a warrior! A warrior is
match for a warrior.</font></p>

<p><font>(v) The words, attha, object, purpose;
hita, benefit, blessing; and sukha, happiness, are used in the
Dat. with the meaning respectively of: for the purpose of, for;
for the benefit of; for the happiness of; and they govern a Gen.:
ropanassa atth&#257;ya, or, ropanatth&#257;ya, for the purpose of
sowing; devamanuss&#257;na</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> hit&#257;ya, for the benefit of gods and men;
tassa sukh&#257;ya, for his hapiness.</font></p>

<p><font>(vi) The Dat. may denote the purpose for
which, and then governs a Gen: d&#257;rassa bhara&#7751;&#257;ya for
the purpose of maintaining a wife, for the maintenance of a wife,
to maintain a wife.<br>
Remark. It will be seen from this example that the Dat. in
&#257;ya has the force of an Infinitive.</font></p>

<p><font>(vii) The Dat. is also used with the
verb ma&#241;&#241;ati, to consider, esteem, when contempt is
implied:<br>
kali&#7749;garassa tuyha</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> ma&#241;&#241;e, I consider thee as chaff, a fig
for you! j&#299;vita</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> ti&#7751;aya na ma&#241;&#241;e, I do<br>
not consider life (so much) as grass, I do not care in the least
for life.</font></p>

<p><font>(viii) The place to which motion is
directed is sometimes put in the Dat: appo sagg&#257;ya gacchati,
(only) the few go to heaven; niray&#257;ya upaka&#7693;&#7693;hati, drags
down to hell; so ma</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> udak&#257;ya neti, he takes me to the water.</font></p>

<p><font>(ix) The Dat. is often used instead of
the Accusative, and also of the Locative.</font></p>

<p><font><strong>598.</strong> </font><font
color="#FF0000"><strong>4. The Accusative</strong></font></p>

<p><font>(i) The Accusative Case is generally
governed by transitive verbs: ratha</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> karoti, he makes
a carriage; &#257;h&#257;ro bala</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> janeti, food
produces (=gives strength).</font></p>

<p><font>(ii) All verbs implying motion govern
the Acc.: nagara</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> gacchati; he goes to town; bhagavanta</font><font
size="3">&#7747;</font><font>
upasa&#7749;kamitv&#257;, having approached the Blessed One.</font></p>

<p><font>(iii) Verbs having the meaning of, to
choose to name, to call, to appoint, to ask, to make, to know, to
consider, etc. take two accusatives, one a direct object and the
other a factitive or indirect object: puriso bh&#257;ra</font><font
size="3">&#7747;</font><font> gama</font><font
size="3">&#7747;</font><font> vahati,
the man carries the load to the village; purisa</font><font
size="3">&#7747;</font><font>
gacchanta</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> passati, he sees the man going; here g&#257;ma</font><font
size="3">&#7747;</font><font> and
gacchanta</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> are the factitive objects.</font></p>

<p><font>(iv) Causative Verbs likewise govern two
Accusatives: puriso purisa</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> g&#257;ma</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> gam&#257;yati: the man causes the man to go to
the village; &#257;cariyo sisa</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> dhamma</font><font
size="3">&#7747;</font><font>
p&#257;theti, the preceptor causes the disciple to read the
Doctrine.<br>
Remark. In such examples the Instrumentive may be used instead of
the factitive object: s&#257;miko d&#257;sena (or d&#257;sa</font><font
size="3">&#7747;</font><font>) khajja</font><font
size="3">&#7747;</font><font>
kh&#257;d&#257;peti. The master causes the slave to eat the food;
purisena (or purisa</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font>) kamma</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> k&#257;reti, he causes the slave to do the work.</font></p>

<p><font>(v) When thc roots: &#8730;vas, to live;
&#8730;th&#257;, to stand; &#8730;si, to lie down; &#8730;pad to go step; and
&#8730;vis to enter; are preceded by the verbal prefixes: anu, upa,
abhi, adhi, &#257; and ni, they govern the Acc: g&#257;ma</font><font
size="3">&#7747;</font><font>
upavasati, he lives near the village; nagara</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> adhivasanti, they
dwell in the village; ma&#241; ca</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> abhins&#299;deyya; he
ought to sit on the cot; sakkassa sahabyata</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> upapajjati, got
into companionship with Sakka, she went to Sakka's heaven.</font></p>

<p><font>(vi) The Acc. is used for the Loc.: nadi</font><font
size="3">&#7747;</font><font>
pivati=nadiya</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> pivati, he drinks in the river; g&#257;ma</font><font
size="3">&#7747;</font><font>
carati=g&#257;me carati he roams in the village.</font></p>

prepositions.</font></p>

<p><font><strong>600.</strong> </font><font
color="#FF0000"><strong>6. The Ablative</strong></font></p>

<p><font>(i) The primary meaning of the Ablative

<p><font>(iv) The place &quot;wherein&quot; an
action is performed is put in the Abl.; in such cases a gerund is
sometimes understood according to native grammarians, but the
student will remark that these expressions have their exact
parallel in English: p&#257;s&#257;d&#257; oloketi, he looks from
the palace, is said to be equivalent to: p&#257;s&#257;da</font><font
size="3">&#7747;</font><font>

size="3">&#7747;</font><font>

size="3">&#7747;</font><font>
&#257;y&#257;mena, yojana</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> vitth&#257;rena.</font></p>

<p><font>(vi) That from which a person or animal

conceal, &quot;the person from whom one wishes to hide is in the
Abl: upajjh&#257;ya antaradh&#257;yati sisso, the pupil hides
himself from his preceptor.<br>
Remark. In such expressions, the Gen. may also be used:
antaradh&#257;yiss&#257;mi sama&#7751;assa gotamasssa, I will hide
myself from the samana Gotama.</font></p>

<p><font>(viii) When the verb
&quot;antaradh&#257;yati&quot; means, to vanish, to disappear,
the place from which one vanishes is put in the Locative:
jetavane antaradh&#257;yitv&#257;, having disappeared from the
Jetavana Monastery.</font></p>

<p><font>(ix) But when &#7749;atural phenomena&quot;

j&#257;tiy&#257; he is released from existence: corehi
bh&#257;y&#257;mi, I am afraid of thieves.</font></p>

<p><font>(xi) The Abl. also shows &#7747;otive, cause,
reason&quot; and can be translated by for, on account of, by
reason of, through , etc.: v&#257;c&#257;ya marati, he died on
account of his speech: s&#299;lato na</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> pasa</font><font
size="3">&#7747;</font><font>santi,
they praise him for his virtue.<br>
Remark. In these examples, the Inst. may be used as well: s&#299;lena
pasa</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font>santi.</font></p>

<p><font>(xii) It is used with words showing
proximity, g&#257;m&#257; sam&#299;pa</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font>, near the
village.<br>

j&#257;yati bhaya</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font>, from a thief fear arises.</font></p>

<p><font>(xiv) The following indeclinables govern

buddhasm&#257; pati s&#257;riputto, Sariputta takes the place of
the Buddha; rite saddhamma, without the true Doctrine, etc.</font></p>

<p><font>(xv) It should be noted that the Abl. is
very frequently used, instead of the Inst., Accus., the Gen. and
the Loc., e.g. vin&#257;saddhamm&#257;, or vin&#257; saddhamma</font><font
size="3">&#7747;</font><font> or
vin&#257; saddhammena.</font></p>

<p><font><strong>601.</strong> </font><font
color="#FF0000"><strong>7. The Locative</strong></font></p>

<p><font>(i) The Locative shows the place in or
on which a thing or person is, or an action performed; it is
therefore expressed in English by &quot;in, on, upon, at.&quot;
kate nis&#299;dati puriso, the man is sitting on the mat; thaliya</font><font
size="3">&#7747;</font><font> odana</font><font

ha&#241;&#241;ante, the panther is killed for its skin;
ku&#241;jaro dantesu ha&#241;&#241;ate, the elephant is killed
for his tusks.</font></p>

<p><font>(iii) It denotes time when an action
takes place; s&#257;ya&#7751;hasamaye &#257;gato, he came in the
evening.</font></p>

<p><font>(iv) When the pre-eminence of an
individual (thing or person) over the whole class to which he
belongs is implied, as well as with adjectives in the superlative
degree, the noun with respect to which such pre-eminence or such
superlative degree of excellence is shown is put in the Loc. or
in the Gen.: manussesu khattiyo s&#363;ratamo, the k·atriya is the
most valiant of men; manuss&#257;na</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> khattiyo
s&#363;ratamo; ka&#7751;h&#257; g&#257;visu sampannakh&#299;ratam&#257;, of

&#241;&#257;&#7751;asmi</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> ussuko, eager for wisdom, or &#241;&#257;&#7751;ena
ussako; &#241;&#257;&#7751;asmi</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> pas&#299;dito, contented with wisdom,
&#241;&#257;&#7751;ena pas&#299;dito.</font></p>

<p><font>(vii) Words signifying &quot;reverence,
respect, love, delighting in, saluting, taking, seizing,
striking, kissing, fond of, adoring,&quot; govern the Loc.:

him in the precipice; purisa</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> s&#299;se paharati, struck the man on the head.</font></p>

show that one does not take any account of something or person:
rudantasmi</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> d&#257;rake pabbaji, he left the world in spite
of his son weeping. The Genitive also may be used: rudantassa
&#257;rakassa pabbaji (See: Locative and Genitive Absolute).</font></p>

<p><font>(ix) The Loc. is employed to denote
superiority or inferiority, with the words &quot;upa&quot; and
&quot;adhi&quot; respectively. upa kh&#257;riya</font><font
size="3">&#7747;</font><font> do&#7751;o, a

<p><font>(xi) The Loc. is used absolutely with a
participle in the same case as itself (see, Absolute
Construction).</font></p>

<p><font>(xii) In lexicons, the Loc. is used to
signify &quot;in the sense of&quot; ru sadde, (the root) ru, is
used in the sense of making noise.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font>(xiii) Words denoting &quot;fitness,
suitability&quot; govern the Loc.: tayi na yutta</font><font
size="3">&#7747;</font><font>, not fit
for thee; the Gen. is used in the same sense: tava na yutta</font><font
size="3">&#7747;</font><font>.</font></p>

<p><font>(xiv) The Loc. is extensively used
instead of other Cases, and the students must be prepared to meet
the Loc. where very often he would expect to find some other
case.<br>
Let him note that in almost all instances, the Case for which the
Loc. stands may be and is, used.</font></p>

<p><font>(xv) The Loc. in used for the Gen, (see,
above, v).</font></p>

<p><font>(xvi) It is used for the Inst.: pattesu
pi&#7751;&#7693;&#257;ya car&#257;nti, they go about with bowls for their

adverbially; at&#299;te, formerly.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FF0000"><strong>8. The Vocatives</strong></font></p>

<p><font><strong>602.</strong> The Vocative Case
does not require any explanations: it is used exactly as in
English.</font></p>

<p><font><strong>603.</strong> </font><font
color="#FF0000"><strong>The Genitive and Locative
Absolute</strong></font></p>

<p><font>(i) When a noun or a pronoun in the
Locative or Genitive is used with a participle in the same case
as itself, the construction is called, Locative Absolute and
Genitive Absolute respectively. The Locative Absolute
construction is met with much more often than the Genitive
absolute. There is also found, now and then, a Nominative
Absolute construction, but far less common than the other two.</font></p>

<p><font>(ii) The Locative, Genitive and
(sometimes) the Nominative Absolute, may often be translated by
&quot;when, while, since&quot; and sometimes by
&quot;although&quot;: tesu vivadantesu bodhisatto cintesi, while
they were disputing, the Future Buddha thought; suriye
attha&#7749;gate, when the sun had set, after sunset; gavisu
duyham&#257;n&#257;su gato, he went when the cows were being
milked; asaniy&#257; pi s&#299;se patantiy&#257;, although the
thunderbolt was falling on their head.</font></p>

<p><font>(iii) sati, the Locative singular of
santo, Pres. part of the verb atthi, to be, besides having the
above meanings may also often be translated by &quot;if, such
being the case&quot;: atthe sati, if there be need: eva</font><font
size="3">&#7747;</font><font> sati,
such being the case; payoge sati, when there is occasion. With
Feminine words, sati is also used, although it should be,
satiy&#257; (Fem.): pucch&#257;ya sati, if the question be asked;
ruciy&#257; sati, had he the desire, if he had the wish.</font></p>

<p><font>(iv) The Genitive Absolute is not quite
so frequently used as the Loc. Absolute although found often
enough: s&#257;ku&#7751;akassa gumbato j&#257;la</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> mocentass'eva,
even while the fowler was disengaging the net from the bush; tesa</font><font
size="3">&#7747;</font><font>ki&#7735;ant&#257;na</font><font
size="3">&#7747;</font><font> yeva
suriyattha&#7749;igatavel&#257; j&#257;t&#257;, while even they were
sporting, it became dusk.</font></p>

<p><font>(v) There is also mentioned a so-called
Nominative Absolute; gacchanto bh&#257;radv&#257;jo so,
addas&#257; ajjhuta</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> isi</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font>, Bharadvaja having gone he .. etc.,
y&#257;ym&#257;no mah&#257;r&#257;j&#257;, add&#257;s&#299; tantarena
ge, as the king was going, he. . . ., etc,<br>
Remark. The Gen. Absolute is frequently used to show
&quot;disregard, contempt&quot;, it can then be translated by
&quot;in spite of, notwithstanding&quot;. For example see above
(601, v&#299;i).</font></p>

<p><font><strong>604.</strong> </font><font
color="#0000FF" size="4"><strong>Syntax of the
Adjective</strong></font></p>

<p><font>(i) As has already been said, whenever
an adjective is not in composition with another word, it must
agree with the word it qualifies in number, gender and case.</font></p>

<p><font>(ii) Adjectives in the comparative
degree require an Ablative: s&#299;la</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> eva sut&#257;
seyyo, virtue is better than learning.</font></p>

<p><font>(iii) Comparison is also expressed by an
Abl. followed by an adjective in the positive degree:<br>
m&#257;dhur&#257; p&#257;&#7789;aliputtakehi abhirup&#257;, the people
of Madhura are more handsome than those of P&#257;&#7789;aliputta.</font></p>

<p><font>(iv) It is also expressed by the
indeclinable vara</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font>, better, with an Abl.: tato vara</font><font
size="3">&#7747;</font><font>; better
than that.</font></p>

<p><font>(v) When &quot;the better of two&quot;
is to be expressed, a Gen. is used with the positive degree:<br>
tumhaka</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> dvinna</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> ko bhaddako of you two who is the better?</font></p>

<p><font>(vi) Superlative adjectives are used
with the Gen. or the Loc, for examples see above (601, iv).</font></p>

<p><font>(vi) </font><font color="#0000FF"
size="4"><strong>Syntax of Pronouns</strong></font></p>

<p><font><strong>605.</strong> </font><font
color="#FF0000"><strong>1. Personal Pronouns</strong></font></p>

<p><font>(i) The personal pronouns are used much
in the same way as in English, and do not call for particular
remarks, except, perhaps, the enclitic forms of aha</font><font
size="3">&#7747;</font><font> and tva</font><font
size="3">&#7747;</font><font>; (289-b,
c; 290, c).</font></p>

<p><font>(ii) The enclitic forms of aha</font><font
size="3">&#7747;</font><font>: me and
no, and those of tva</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font>: te and vo, are never used at the beginning of a
sentence nor immediately before the particles ca, t&#257; and
eva: detu me, let him give to me; tava v&#257; me hotu, be it
thine or mine; kamma</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> no ni&#7789;&#7789;hita</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font>, our task is
finished; ko te doso, what is thy fault? kaha</font><font

r&#257;j&#257;, where is your king?</font></p>

<p><font>(iii) With verbs, the personal pronouns
are frequently understood, as the endings of the tenses clearly
indicate also the person as: gacchati (he) goes=so gacchati;
gaccheyy&#257;mi, (I) should go=aha</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> gaccheyy&#257;mi
etc.</font></p>

<p><font>(iv) The personal pronoun so, s&#257;,
ta</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> is also used as a demonstrative and as an
article. See Concord (589). Therefore, so puriso may mean
according to the context: the man, or, that man.</font></p>

<p><font>(v) Tasm&#257; (abl ), is used
adverbially in the sense of &quot;therefore accordingly,
thereby&quot;: with the same meanings it is also followed by hi
and ti ha (=iti ha): tasm&#257; hi pa&#241;&#241;&#257; ca
dhanena seyyo, and therefore is wisdom better than riches;
tasm&#257; ti ha bhikkhave, accordingly, O monks!</font></p>

<p><font>(vi) The Inst. tena is used with the
same meanings as tasm&#257;: tena ta</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> madhura</font><font
size="3">&#7747;</font><font>,
therefore, on that account, it is sweet. Tena followed by hi
means &quot;well! very well! all right! well then!&quot; tena hi
kh&#257;d&#257;pess&#257;mi nan ti, very well, then, I'll make
you devour him.</font></p>

<p><font>(vii) Na</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> and ena</font><font
size="3">&#7747;</font><font> (295,
300), are used when something or someone already mentioned is
referred to. See (296).</font></p>

<p><font><strong>606.</strong> </font><font
color="#FF0000"><strong>2. Demonstrative Pronouns</strong></font></p>

<p><font>(i) eso, es&#257;, eta</font><font
size="3">&#7747;</font><font> (298),
refer to what is near, and mean: this; es&#257; itth&#299;, this
woman; nirupak&#257;ro es&#257;, this (fellow) is useless.</font></p>

<p><font>The same remarks apply to aya</font><font
size="3">&#7747;</font><font> and asu,
this.<br>
Remark. esa is often used for eso, sa for so.</font></p>

<p><font>(ii) The neuter etad (=eta</font><font
size="3">&#7747;</font><font>, 302),
is used with the verb hoti and the Gen. of the person, and the
expression is then equivalent to &quot;to think&quot;: tassa etad
ahosi, he thought... (lit=of his this was).</font></p>

<p><font><strong>607.</strong> </font><font
color="#FF0000"><strong>3. The Relative</strong></font></p>

<p><font>(i) We have already explained the
Relative (592); only a few of its most important peculiar uses
need be mentioned here:</font></p>

<p><font>(ii) Yo (311) is used with the
Indefinite koci (319): yo koci, whoever, anyone; ya</font><font
size="3">&#7747;</font><font>
ki&#241;ci, whatsoever, anything. See (314-a, b).</font></p>

<p><font>(iii) The Neut. Sing. ya</font><font
size="3">&#7747;</font><font> is
frequently used adverbially in the sense of &quot;as; that,
because, since, seeing that, If, when &quot;ta</font><font
size="3">&#7747;</font><font> bahu</font><font
size="3">&#7747;</font><font> ya</font><font
size="3">&#7747;</font><font> pi
j&#299;vasi, it is much that thou livest.</font></p>

<p><font>(iv) The Inst. yena is used as an
adverb, meaning &quot;whereby, by which, for which,
because&quot;: yena na</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> ga&#7751;hiss&#257;mi, by which I shall catch him.</font></p>

<p><font>(v) When motion to a definite place is
expressed, yena, where, is used with tena, there: yena
bhagav&#257;, ten'upasa&#7749;kati, he went to Buddha (lit. where was
Buddha there he approached).</font></p>

<p><font>(vi) Yasm&#257; (Abl.), is used in the
sense of &quot;because&quot; and is then generally followed by
tasm&#257;, therefore; yasm&#257; tva</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> na
j&#257;n&#257;si tasm&#257; b&#257;lo's&#299; ti, because thou doth
not understand, therefore art thou a fool.</font></p>

<p><font><strong>608.</strong> </font><font
color="#FF0000"><strong>4. The Interrogative</strong></font></p>

<p><font>(i) The interrogative pronoun ko (316),
may be used by itself or with a noun or pronoun: ko pana tva</font><font
size="3">&#7747;</font><font>, who art
thou? ke ete, who are these? k&#257; d&#257;rik&#257;, which
girl?</font></p>

<p><font>(ii) kena (Inst.) used with attho and
the Dat. of the person, forms such expressions as &quot;what do
you want?&quot; etc,: kena te attho, what are you in need of?</font></p>

<p><font>(iii) kena (Inst.) kasm&#257; (Abl.) and
kissa (Gen.) are used adverbially with the meaning of &quot;why?
wherefore?&quot;</font></p>

<p><font>(iv) ki</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> is much used with
the Inst. to express &quot;what is the use of?&quot; ki</font><font
size="3">&#7747;</font><font> me
j&#299;vitena, what is the use to me of life?</font></p>

<p><font color="#FF0000"><strong>5. The
Indefinite</strong></font></p>

<p><font><strong>609.</strong> The indefinite
pronoun (319), does not present any peculiarity: m&#257; idha
koci p&#257;visi, let nobody enter here; ki&#241;ci bhaya</font><font
size="3">&#7747;</font><font>, any
danger.</font></p>

<p><font>(vii) </font><font color="#0000FF"
size="4"><strong>Repetition</strong></font></p>

<p><font><strong>610.</strong> To express
&quot;plurality, totality, distribution, variety,
multiplicity,&quot; etc., words are sometimes repeated: tesu tesu
&#7789;h&#257;nesu in various places; ta</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> ta</font><font
size="3">&#7747;</font><font> kathaya
m&#257;n&#257;, saying this and this. yo, thus repeated means
&quot;whoever, whatever, whichever&quot;: ya</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> ya</font><font

flight.</font></p>

<p><font><strong>611.</strong> (viii) </font><font
color="#0000FF" size="4"><strong>Syntax of Verbs</strong></font></p>

<p><font>(i) The Concord of the verb with its
subject has already been noticed (590, 1st).</font></p>

<p><font>(ii) The Present Tense denotes an action
taking place now, a fact existing at the present time so
bh&#257;yati, he is afraid; s&#257; pacati, she cooks.</font></p>

<p><font>(iii) The present tense often expresses
the continuance of an action and is equivalent to the present
progressive: s&#257; gabbhe nis&#299;dati, she is sitting in her
private room.</font></p>

<p><font>(iv) Habit, custom and general truths
are expressed by the present tense sabbe maranti, all (men) die;
bhikkhu s&#299;la</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> &#257;carati: a monk practises virtue.</font></p>

<p><font>(v) The present is sometimes used with a
future signification: ki</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> karomi, what shall I do?</font></p>

<p><font>(vi) The present is extremely frequent
in narrations when recounting past events as if they were
actually happening, this is called the Historical Present: so
pa&#241;cam&#257;&#7751;avakasat&#257;ni sippa</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font>
ugga&#7751;h&#257;peti, he taught five hundred young men (lit. he
teaches).</font></p>

<p><font>(vii) When no interrogative particle is
used, interrogation is sometimes expressed by placing the present
tense at the beginning of the sentence: socasi tva</font><font
size="3">&#7747;</font><font>
up&#257;saka, grievest thou, O layman? Remark. Other tenses may
also be used in the same way to mark interrogation.</font></p>

<p><font><strong>612.</strong> </font><font
color="#FF0000"><strong>The Past Tense</strong></font><font><br>
Perfect, Imperfect and Aorist.</font></p>

<p><font>(i) The Perfect and the Imperfect tenses
present no difficulty, they are as a rule used in the sense of a
general past, and they do not require any notice. Let it be borne
in mind, however, that the Perfect is but seldom used; that the
Imperfect, though more frequent than the Perfect, does seldom
differ from it in meaning and last, that the Aorist has generally
displaced these two tenses and superseded them.</font></p>

<p><font>(ii) The Aorist is the principal past
tense in P&#257;li and is therefore extensively used; it
expresses indefinite past time, but also includes the Present
day. The Aorist may be translated by the Present Perfect or the
Past Indefinite (See 405): catupp&#257;d&#363; pi eka</font><font
size="3">&#7747;</font><font> s&#299;ha</font><font
size="3">&#7747;</font><font>
r&#257;j&#257;na</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> aka</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font>su, the quadrupeds made a lion king; mukhe
pahari, struck him on the mouth; kena k&#257;ra&#7751;ena rodi, why
did you cry? br&#257;hma&#7751;o e&#7735;akena saddhi</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> vicari, the
brahmin walked about with the goat.</font></p>

<p><font>(iii) The indeclinable m&#257; is used
with the Aorist to express prohibition:<br>
e&#7735;aka, m&#257; bh&#257;yi, O! goat, fear not! m&#257; puna
evar&#363;pa</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> ak&#257;si, do not do so again; t&#257;ta,
m&#257; gami, dear son, do not go.</font></p>

<p><font><strong>613.</strong> </font><font
color="#FF0000"><strong>Future Tense</strong></font></p>

<p><font>(i) The Future expresses simple
futurity: aha</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> gacchiss&#257;mi, I shall go; te marissanti,
they will die.</font></p>

<p><font>(ii) The future is also used as a mild
form of the Imperative, when courteously giving a command: tva</font><font
size="3">&#7747;</font><font> tassa
bandhana</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> dantehi kh&#257;dissasi, cut his bonds with thy
teeth.</font></p>

<p><font>(iii) The future is used to express
simple condition, with the particles ce, sace and yadi: yadi tva</font><font
size="3">&#7747;</font><font>
y&#257;gu</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> pacissasi aha</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> piviss&#257;mi,
if thou wilt cook the gruel, I shall drink it; so ta&#241; ce
labhissati, tena saddhi</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> gaccha, if he gets it, go with him.</font></p>

<p><font>(iv) bhavissati, the 3rd. pers. sing. of
bhavati, to be, is often used in the sense of &quot;it must be
that...: cor&#257; pathama</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> &#241;eva bherisadda</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> sutv&#257;
issarabheri bhavissat&#299; ti pal&#257;yitv&#257;, the theives on
first hearing the beating of the drum, (said) &quot;It must be
the drum of an official&quot; and fled; aya</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> me putto
bhavissati, he must be my son.</font></p>

<p><font>(v) bhavissati preceded by the negative
particle na may be translated by &quot;it cannot be&quot;
n&#257;ya</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> issarabheri bhavissati. This cannot be an
official's drum.</font></p>

<p><font>(vi) j&#257;niss&#257;mi, the 3rd. pers
sing of j&#257;n&#257;ti, to know, is often used idiomatically in
the sense of &quot;I'll see&quot;: hotu, pacch&#257;
j&#257;niss&#257;mi, let it be, I'll see (to it) afterwards.</font></p>

<p><font><strong>614.</strong> </font><font
color="#FF0000"><strong>The Optative</strong></font></p>

<p><font>(i) The Optative expresses
&quot;probability, capability, fitness, assent or permission,
command, wish, condition&quot; and is also used in laying down
rules and precepts.</font></p>

<p><font>(ii) Fitness: tva</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> tattha
gaccheyy&#257;si, you should go there.</font></p>

<p><font>(iii) Wish: aha</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> ima</font><font
size="3">&#7747;</font><font>

and give it to you, but...</font></p>

<p><font>(iv) Command: tva</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> pana ito

<p><font>(v) Probability: api ca n&#257;ma
gaccheyy&#257;mi, I may go.</font></p>

<p><font>(vi) When expressing condition, it is
usually preceded by ce, sace or yadi, if: s&#257;mi, sace
im&#257;ya vel&#257;ya tava sapatta</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> passeyy&#257;si
kin ti ta</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> kareyy&#257;si? Lord, if, at this time thou
should see thy enemy, what would thou do to him?</font></p>

<p><font>(vii) To express supposition, the word
yath&#257; is sometimes used with the Optative: yath&#257;
mah&#257;r&#257;ja kocideva puriso pad&#299;pa</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> pad&#299;peyya, were,
maharaja, a man to light a lamp...</font></p>

<p><font>(viii) Assent: tva</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> id&#257;ni
gaccheyy&#257;si, thou may now go.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FF0000"><strong>The Conditional</strong></font></p>

<p><font><strong>615.</strong> The Conditional
expresses an action unable to be performed on account of some
impediment in the way of its execution: so ce ta</font><font
size="3">&#7747;</font><font>
y&#257;na</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> alabhissa agacchiss&#257;, he would go if he
could get that vehicle; bho satthav&#257;sino, sace esa

this ascetic been walking to and fro at the foot of this tree you
should all have been completely pillaged.</font></p>

<p><font><strong>616.</strong> </font><font
color="#FF0000"><strong>The Imperative</strong></font></p>

<p><font>(i) The Imperative is used in giving
commands: tena hi, gaccha, very well, go!</font></p>

<p><font>(ii) It expresses entreaty: bhante
bhagav&#257; apposukko viharatu, Lord, let the Blessed One now
live free from cares.</font></p>

<p><font>(iii) Benedictions, blessings: vassasata</font><font
size="3">&#7747;</font><font>, j&#299;va,
may you live a hundred years!</font></p>

<p><font>(iv) With m&#257; prefixed, the
Imperative 2nd person expresses simple prohibition (see Aorist
612, iii) m&#257; eva</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> karotha, do not do so!</font></p>

<p><font>(v) The Imperative 3rd person sing. of
bhavati, to be, is often used idiomatically, with the meaning of
&quot;very well&quot;: hotu, aha</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> ja&#7751;iss&#257;mi,
very well I'll see (to it).</font></p>

<p><font><strong>617.</strong> </font><font
color="#FF0000"><strong>The Infinitive</strong></font></p>

<p><font>(i) The Infinitive shows &quot;purpose,
motive intention&quot;. It is used actively as well as passively.<br>
&#363;yy&#257;nap&#257;lo cha&#7693;&#7693;etu</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> up&#257;ya</font><font
size="3">&#7747;</font><font> na
passati, the gardener saw no means of throwing (them) away;<br>
ta</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> gantu</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font>, na dass&#257;mi, I will not let him go.</font></p>

<p><font>(ii) The Infinitive is used with verbs
meaning &quot;to wish to try or strive, to begin, to be
able&quot;: s&#257; roditu</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font>, &#257;rabhi, she began to cry; na koci
may&#257; saddhi</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> sallapitu</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> sakkoti, no one can converse with me; s&#257;
pavisitu</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> na icchati, she did not wish to enter; so ta</font><font
size="3">&#7747;</font><font>
ukkhipitu</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> ussahati, he endeavoured to lift it.</font></p>

<p><font>(iii) The verb dad&#257;ti to give,
after an Inf. means &quot;to let, to allow&quot; and the verb
labhati, to obtain, means &quot;to be allowed&quot;: ta</font><font
size="3">&#7747;</font><font> paharitu</font><font
size="3">&#7747;</font><font> na
dass&#257;mi, I will not allow him to be struck; gehabahi
nikkhamitu</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> alabhanto, not being allowed to go out of the
house.</font></p>

<p><font>(iv) Verbs like va&#7789;&#7789;ati, to behove, to
be fit, proper, and adjectives like yu&#7789;&#7789;o, having the same
meaning, are much used with the Inf.; in the case of va&#7789;&#7789;ati,
the Instrumentive is used of the person who ought to do the act:
ettha d&#257;ni may&#257; vasitu</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> vattati, it now
behoves me to live; it is used also impersonally: ta</font><font
size="3">&#7747;</font><font> haritu</font><font
size="3">&#7747;</font><font>
va&#7789;&#7789;ati, the best is to kill him, it is proper, fit, to kill
him. eva</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> kathetu</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> na yu&#7789;&#7789;a</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font>, it is not proper to speak thus.</font></p>

<p><font>(v) The indeclinable labbha, possible,
allowable and sakk&#257;, possible, able, are used wih the Inf.:
sakk&#257; is used much in the same way as va&#7789;&#7789;ati, that is,
actively or passively, and often with the Inst. of the person;
the verb hoti frequently follows sakk&#257;: sakk&#257; hoti
methuna</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> dhamma</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> pa&#7789;isevitu</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font>, it is possible to practise fornication; etasmi</font><font

to live in this place; ida</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> na labbhh&#257; eva</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> katu</font><font
size="3">&#7747;</font><font>, it is
not possible to do it in this way.</font></p>

<p><font>(vi) When k&#257;mo, willing, desirous,
is compounded with an Inf., final </font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> of the Inf. is
dropped:<br>
devat&#257;ya balikamma</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> k&#257;retuk&#257;mo, wishing to make an
offering to the god.</font></p>

<p><font><strong>618.</strong> </font><font
color="#FF0000"><strong>The Gerund</strong></font></p>

<p><font>(i) The Gerund always denotes an action
completed before another; it may be translated by the word
&quot;having&quot; followed by a past participle as: gantv&#257;,
having gone; or by the past tense followed by the conjunction
&quot;and&quot; : gantv&#257;, he went and... The gerund,
therefore, being very extensively used, is the most common
connective in P&#257;li , and practically does away with the
P&#257;li conjunction equivalent to the English &quot;and&quot;
connecting two sentences. so ta</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> ukkhipitv&#257;
ghara</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> netv&#257; catudh&#257; vibhajitv&#257;

yath&#257;kamma</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> gato, He lifted it up, took it home, divided
into four parts and, practising alms-giving and other good deeds,
went according to his deeds.</font></p>

<p><font>(ii) The word va (=eva) following a
gerund, may be translated by &quot;as soon as&quot;: ta</font><font
size="3">&#7747;</font><font> vacana</font><font
size="3">&#7747;</font><font>
sutv&#257; va, as soon as he heard these words...; so v&#257;ndro
attano putta</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> disv&#257; va, the monkey, as soon as he saw his
offspring...</font></p>

<p><font>(iii) The particle &quot;api&quot;
coming after a gerund, may be translated by &quot;although&quot;:
akata&#241;&#241;&#363; puggalo cakkavattirajja</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> datv&#257; pi
tosetu</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> na sakk&#257;, an ungrateful man cannot be
satisfied although he be given universal sovereignty.</font></p>

<p><font>(iv) Before a gerund, a may be
translated by &quot;without&quot;: papa&#241;ca</font><font
size="3">&#7747;</font><font>
akatv&#257;, without making delays, without any delay; eka</font><font
size="3">&#7747;</font><font> pi
akilametv&#257;, without harming even one person.</font></p>

<p><font>(v) Some gerunds are used
prepositionally; the principal of them are: patth&#257;ya since,
beginning from, from, after; sandh&#257;ya, with reference to,
concerning; &#257;rabbha concerning, with reference to;
sa&#241;cicca intentionally; asallakkhetv&#257;, inadvertently,
unawares: niss&#257;ya, upaniss&#257;ya, on account of, through,
near; &#257;d&#257;ya, with; paticca by, through, on account of;
&#7789;hapetv&#257;, except, excepting.</font></p>

<p><font>(vi) The Gerund may sometimes be
translated by the present participle; idha &#257;gantv&#257; aha</font><font
size="3">&#7747;</font><font> cora</font><font
size="3">&#7747;</font><font> passi</font><font
size="3">&#7747;</font><font>, coming
here I saw the thief.</font></p>

<p><font>(vii) The Gerund may have a passive
signification: coraje&#7789;&#7789;hakena gahetv&#257;, having been seized
by the robber chief.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FF0000"><strong>The Participles</strong></font></p>

<p><font><strong>619.</strong> </font><font
color="#0000FF"><strong>The Present Participle</strong></font></p>

<p><font>(i) The Present Participle may generally
be translated by &quot;while, whilst,&quot; which sense is
inherent in it; this participle always expresses contemporaneity
of action: attano g&#257;ma</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> gacchanto cor&#257;&#7789;avi</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> patv&#257;, while
going to his village he came upon a forest inhabited by thieves;
tattha gantv&#257; m&#257;tara</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> pa&#7789;ijagganto
v&#257;sa</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> kappesi, he went and, taking care of his mother,
took up his abode there.</font></p>

<p><font>(ii) It must be remembered that
participles are of the nature of adjectives (439) and must agree
with the word they qualify in the same way as adjectives:
av&#299;ciniraya</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> gacchant&#257; satt&#257;..., persons going to
the Avici Hell; &#257;gacchanta</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> ta</font><font
size="3">&#7747;</font><font>
disv&#257; pi, although he saw him coming.</font></p>

<p><font>(iii) The present participle is
sometimes used substantively, and may be translated by &quot;he
who&quot; (does the action expressed by the verb): ida</font><font
size="3">&#7747;</font><font> pana
paraloka</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> gacchantassa patheyya</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> bhavissati, but
this will be provisions for him who goes to the other world:
paraloka</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> gacchanto eka</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> kah&#257;pa&#7751;a</font><font
size="3">&#7747;</font><font> pi
gahetv&#257; na gacchati he who goes to the other world does not
take even one cent with him.</font></p>

<p><font>(iv) The present participle may also
sometimes be translated by a conditional clause: ta</font><font
size="3">&#7747;</font><font> labhanto
j&#299;vissami alabhanto idh' eva mariss&#257;mi, if I obtain her I
shall live; if not, in this very spot shall I die; addham&#257;se
sahassa</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> labhanto upa&#7789;&#7789;hahiss&#257;mi deva, if I get a
thousand every fortnight, I'll serve thee, Lord; eva</font><font
size="3">&#7747;</font><font> karonto
lacchasi akaronto na lacchasi, if you do so you'll get it, if
not, you will not get it.</font></p>

<p><font>(v) The particle pi (=api) following a
pres. part. may be rendered by &quot;although&quot;: pitar&#257;
v&#257;riyam&#257;no pi, although prevented by his father; ta</font><font
size="3">&#7747;</font><font>
apassanto pi; although not seeing him.</font></p>

<p><font><strong>620.</strong> </font><font
color="#0000FF"><strong>2. The Past Participles</strong></font></p>

<p><font>(i) There are two past participles, the
Perfect Active (231, 465) and the Passive Perfect (450).</font></p>

<p><font>(ii) The perfect active participle
presents no difficulty whatever: so s&#299;ha</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font>
&#257;dinnav&#257;, he having captured the lion; bhatta</font><font
size="3">&#7747;</font><font>
bhutt&#257;v&#299;, having taken his meal.</font></p>

<p><font>(iii) The passive perfect participle is
very often used as a predicate instead of a finite verb (See
Concord of Subject and Predicate 590); it can then be translated
by a past tense.</font></p>

<p><font>(iv) The P.P.P. of roots implying
motion, and of transitive roots, takes an accusative;
sakaniv&#257;sa</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> eva gato, he went to his own place.</font></p>

<p><font>(v) When the P.P.P; is thus used
predicatively, the verb &quot;hoti,&quot; to be, is generally
understood after it.</font></p>

<p><font>(vi) The agent of a P.P.P. is as a rule
put in the Instrumentive case: tay&#257; pa&#241;ha</font><font
size="3">&#7747;</font><font> pu&#7789;&#7789;ha</font><font
size="3">&#7747;</font><font>, by her
the question was asked, she asked the question; s&#257;sana</font><font
size="3">&#7747;</font><font>
may&#257; likkhita</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font>, a letter has been written by me, I have etc.</font></p>

<p><font>(vii) Not seldom the P.P.P. may be
translated by a pres. participle: tato uppatito vijjullata viya
vijjotam&#257;no parat&#299;re a&#7789;&#7789;h&#257;si, springing from there,
he reached the other shore as a lightning flash.</font></p>

<p><font><strong>621.</strong> </font><font
color="#0000FF"><strong>3. The Future Participle</strong></font></p>

<p><font>(i) The future Participle (449) denotes
that the agent is about to perform the action or undergo the
state expressed by the root: ra&#7789;&#7789;h&#257; ra&#7789;&#7789;ha</font><font
size="3">&#7747;</font><font>
vicarissa</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font>, I am going (= I am about to go) from kingdom to
kingdom; ta</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> gantha</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> racissa</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> aha</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font>; I am about to compose that book.</font></p>

<p><font>(ii) It also shows purpose, intention,
as may be seen by the 2nd example in (i) above.</font></p>

<p><font>(iii) It shows simple futurity:
n&#257;ha</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> puna upessa</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> gabbhaseyya</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font>, I shall not be reborn again.</font></p>

<p><font><strong>622.</strong> </font><font
color="#0000FF"><strong>4. The Future Passive
Participle</strong></font></p>

<p><font>(i) The Future Passive Participle
conveys the idea of &quot;fitness, necessity, obligation;&quot;
it denotes that what is expressed by the root is to be, or ought
to be, or is fit to be or must be done or undergone: may&#257;
kattabba</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> kamma</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> ni&#7789;&#7789;hita</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> the work which was to be done by me is finished;
sace so deso ukl&#257;po hoti so deso sammajjitabbo, if the place
be dirty it ought to be swept; na nav&#257; bhikkh&#363; &#257;sanena
pa&#7789;ib&#257;hetabb&#257;, young monks should not be ousted from
their seat.</font></p>

<p><font>(ii) From the above examples, it will be
seen that the F.P.P. must agree with the subject in gender, case
and number.</font></p>

<p><font>(iii) It is much used impersonally:
kinnu kattabba</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font>, what is to be done? ettha ca im&#257;ni
sutt&#257;ni dassetabb&#257;ni, and in this connection these
passages (from the Scriptures) should be pointed out; imin&#257;
nayena veditabbo, it must be understood in this way.</font></p>

<p><font>(iv) It will be, from the above
examples, remarked, that the agent is put in the Instrumentive.</font></p>

<p><font>(v) bhavitabba</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font>, used with the
Inst. of the thing or person, is frequently used in the sense of
&quot;it must be that, one should or ought to'': majjhatten'eva
bhavitabba</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font>, one should be indifferent to...;
visayojit&#257;ya et&#257;ya bhavitabba</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font>, this must have
been mixed with poison.</font></p>

<p><font><strong>623.</strong> (ix) </font><font
color="#0000FF" size="4"><strong>Syntax of
lndeclinables</strong></font></p>

<p><font>(i) The following are used
correlatively:<br>
yath&#257;, as.. &nbsp;ath&#257;, so; yav&#257;, so long...
tav&#257; that long, as long as: yad&#257;, when.. tad&#257;,
then; yattha, where; &nbsp;attha, there.</font></p>

<p><font>(ii) ca...ca..., both...and, so ca
aha&#241; ca, both he and I.<br>
v&#257;...v&#257;.. whether...or: bh&#257;sati v&#257; karoti
v&#257;, whether he speaks or acts.<br>
pi..pi..., both...and si&#241;cati pi si&#241;c&#257;peti pi,
both sprinkles and causes to sprinkle.</font></p>

<p><font>(iii) ca....ca...., and
v&#257;...v&#257;...when in a negative sentence, are equivalent
to: neither...nor.</font></p>

<p><font>(iv) ca and v&#257; used singly, never
come at the beginning of a sentence.</font></p>

<p><font>(v) eva, and, before a vowel yeva is
used to emphasize the idea expressed by a word, and may be
translated by &quot;very, just, quite, exactly, as soon as&quot;:
id&#257;ni eva, just now; attano yeva, one's very own. yeva,
coming after a verb, is not always easy to translate into
English, but in the majority of cases, it may be rendered by
&quot;on, to go on, continue,&quot; etc.: kathenti yeva, they
went on talking.</font></p>

<p><font>(vi) yadi if, is used in conditional
sentences with the Present., the Future, the Optative and the
Conditional. yadi eva</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font>, yajj' eva</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font>, if so, in that case; v&#257;...yadi v&#257;...,
whether...or ; g&#257;me v&#257; yadi v'&#257;ra&#241;&#241;e,
whether in the village or in the forest.<br>
Remark. The syntax of the most important indeclinables has been
given in &quot;Syntax of Substantives.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font><strong>624.</strong> </font><font
color="#FF0000"><strong>Direct and Indirect
Narration</strong></font></p>

<p><font>(i) The oblique construction in
P&#257;li is expressed by placing the particle iti, so, thus,
after the words in the direct construction as they would stand in
English, that is, at the end of the words quoted: kaha</font><font
size="3">&#7747;</font><font> so
etarahi ti pucchi, he asked, &quot;Where is he now?&quot;</font></p>

<p><font>(ii) iti is generally abbreviated to:
ti, and the last vowel of the quotation, if short, is lengthened
before it: s&#257;dh&#363; ti, he said &quot;very well!&quot;</font></p>

<p><font>(iii) Verbs of &quot;saying, telling,
asking, naming, knowing, thinking,&quot; are generally used with
iti; those verbs may be:<br>
(1) Placed after the particle iti: te &quot;s&#257;dh&#363;&quot; ti
vatv&#257;, they said &quot;Very well.&quot;<br>
(2) Before the words quoted: so pucchi &quot;ki</font><font
size="3">&#7747;</font><font>
j&#257;n&#257;si tvan&quot; ti, he asked &quot;What do you
know?&quot;<br>
(3) The verb is frequently omitted altogether:
m&#257;ress&#257;mi nan&quot; ti, (he thought, or said)
&quot;I'll kill him!&quot;<br>
(4) When iti or ti, is followed by a vowel, sandhi takes place
regularly: iti+eva</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font>=icceva</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font>; kvaci+iti=kvac&#299;ti.<br>
(5) Often, iti has the sense of &quot;because, with the intention
of &quot;showing &quot;cause, motive, intention, purpose:&quot;
&quot;j&#299;vitu</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> asakkont&#257;&quot; ti because (we) are unable
to make a living; &#7747;akasa</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> pahariss&#257;mi&quot; ti pitu matthaka</font><font
size="3">&#7747;</font><font>
dvidh&#257; bhindi, intending to kill the mosquito he broke his
father's head in two.</font></p>

<p><font><strong>625.</strong> </font><font
color="#FF0000"><strong>Interrogation and
Negation</strong></font></p>

<p><font>(i) The negative particle is na: imasmi</font><font
size="3">&#7747;</font><font> sare
sudaka</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> n'atthi, there is no water in this lake; na
a&#241;&#241;&#257;si, did not thou know? se&#7789;&#7789;hin&#257; saddhi</font><font
size="3">&#7747;</font><font> kathetu</font><font
size="3">&#7747;</font><font> na
sakkomi, I am unable to speak with the banker.</font></p>

<p><font>(ii) With an Optative, na is used in
prohibition: na hatthis&#257;la</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> gaccheyya, let
him not go to the elephant-shed.</font></p>

<p><font>(iii) na may form the first part of a
compound: n&#257;gamana</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> (=na+&#257;gamanam), non-arrival: na bhikkhu, a
non-monk, a layman.</font></p>

<p><font>(iv) Two negatives make an affirmative:
bheri</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> na na v&#257;deyy&#257;, not that he may not
beat the drum (he may therefore beat it).</font></p>

<p><font>(v) no, is also used in negation in the
same way as na: no jan&#257;ti, he does not know.</font></p>

<p><font>(vi) no, followed by na, expresses a
strong affirmative: no na dhameyya, he should surely blow (the
conch); no nappahoti, he is most certainly able.</font></p>

<p><font>(vii) Interrogation is expressed by
using interrogative adverbs or pronouns as kasm&#257;, why?
wherefore? kissa, kena, why? ko, who? etc.</font></p>

<p><font>(viii) Also by means of interrogative
particles.</font></p>

<p><font>(ix) api, when used in interrogation, is
always placed first in the sentence: ap'avuso, amh&#257;kam
satth&#257;ra</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> j&#257;n&#257;si, do you, Sir, know our Teacher?</font></p>

<p><font>(x) followed by nu kho, it expresses a
very emphatic interrogation: api nu kho koci upaddavo hoti, well,
have you any cause of distress?</font></p>

<p><font>(xi) nu, I wonder! Pray? nu, is often
followed by kho: k&#299;diso nu kho paraloko, I wonder what the next
world is like? cor&#257; nu atthi, are there thieves?</font></p>

<p><font>(xii) Preceded by na, it expresses
emphatic interrogation: na nu'ha</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> yodho, am I not a
warrior?</font></p>

<p><font>(xiii) Interrogation is also expressed
by placing the verb first in the sentence: socasi up&#257;saka,
grievest thou layman?</font></p>

<p><font>(xiv) Sometimes the mere tone of voice
is sufficient to express interrogation: supa</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> labhi, did thou
get broth?</font></p>

<p><font color="#FF0000"><strong>Interjections</strong></font></p>

<p><font>(i) The principal interjections are:
h&#257;, alas! ah! handa, come! a&#7749;ga, indeed! oh! bho, friend!
Sir! I say! hare, sirrah! am&#257;, yes! truly! indeed! aho,
alas! oh! (538).</font></p>

<p><font>(ii) bha&#7751;e, first pers. sing.
Reflective of bha&#7751;ati, to say, is used as an interjection with
the meaning of &quot;to be sure! I say there!&quot;</font></p>

<p><font>(iii) ma&#241;&#241;e, 1st. pers. sing.
Reflective of ma&#241;&#241;ati, to think, is also used as an
interjection in the sense of &#7747;ethinks! I dare say! I
suppose!&quot;</font></p>
