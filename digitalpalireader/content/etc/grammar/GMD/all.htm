	Practical Grammar of the P&#257;li Language<br>
	</strong></font><font>by Charles Duroiselle<br>
	Third Edition 1997</font></p>


	<p id="preface"><font color="#0000FF"><strong>Preface</strong></font></a><font
	color="#0000FF"><strong> to the Third Edition</strong></font></p>

	<p><font>Most introductory P&#257;li grammar
	books consist of lessons that teach the elements of the language
	in stages, but because of that they are also very difficult to
	use as a reference when you need to look up a noun's declension,
	or a verb's conjugation. This book because of its practical and
	comprehensive coverage of the elements of the P&#257;li language
	in complete chapters is a very useful reference. This book was
	also not written for linguistics experts, but for students with
	little experience studying P&#257;li grammar. For these reasons I
	have found it extremely useful and I recommend it to people who
	have already completed one of the many books that have graduated
	exercies intended to introduce the basics of P&#257;li grammar.
	After you have completed one of those preliminary books and move
	on to really read P&#257;li texts you will find this book to be a
	really good friend.</font></p>

	<p><font>Unfortunately, this book having been out
	of print for many years few people know of its existence and the
	copies that people who know about it are using are mainly
	photocopied versions like mine. So I thought that entering the
	text into a computer would be useful for both myself and also for
	other people interested in studying the P&#257;li language.</font></p>

	<p><font>In producing this edition I have made
	some corrections and changes to the original. I have kept most of
	the archaic english spelling and usage. This is because it has a
	certain charm to it and is itself a lesson in language. P&#257;li
	has not changed in the last 80 years, but the reader will soon
	see how much English has changed. The corrections I made were
	mainly to errors in layout editing and punctuation that existed
	in the original book. Still, I have probably left a few and made
	some new ones for the editors of the fourth edition to correct
	when they update the English used.</font></p>

	<p><font>I would like to thank Sayadaw U. Jotika
	who originally showed me the book and Miss Goh Poay Hoon who made
	a photocopy of it for me. Also Sean Doyle who generously let me
	use his scanner and optical character recognition software to
	scan the original in and then create a rough text to be edited;
	Gary Dellora who initially did the first editing of the scanned
	text; and Aniek Ley who donated the computer on which this text
	was edited.</font></p>

	<p><font>May any merit made by all concerned be a
	condition for our attainment of Nibb&#257;na.</font></p>

	Second Edition</strong></font></p>

	<p><font>This grammar was written at a time when
	it was urgently needed for schools and colleges, and as a
	consequence was conceived, written and seen through the press
	within the short space of a little over three months.
	Not-withstanding a few errors which had crept in - and which have
	now been corrected - the favour with which this work was received
	and reviewed in Europe, exceeded the author's expectations, if
	indeed he had any. Such favourable criticism it did not find in
	India: its great defect in the opinion of some Indian gentlemen
	being twofold; it does not enough adhere to the very ancient
	Hindu system of grammatical exposition; this venerable system
	was, it is readily recognized by every scholar, the most suitable
	- in fact the only suitable system for the method of imparting
	knowledge current in the times in which the earliest Sanskrit
	grammars and, modelled on them, the first P&#257;li grammars were
	composed. But, other times, other methods; and I am not alone in
	thinking that the old Hindu system, whatever its undeniable
	merits, could not be with success adapted to the clearer, more
	rapid and rational western methods of teaching. But the more
	unpardonable departure from the beaten track is, that the author
	has not thought it necessary constantly to refer to the Sanskrit
	forms and with them compare and from them deduce the P&#257;li
	ones. It must be remembered that this comparative method, however
	excellent and useful to persons already acquainted with Sanskrit
	who desire to take up the study of P&#257;li, does not answer in
	a practical manner to the needs of the class of students for whom
	this book has been written; that is, young students totally
	ignorant of the first principles of Sanskrit, and who do not, for
	the most part, in the least intend taking up such study.
	Moreover, to those who may later on, take up such a course, the
	close relation between the two languages will become easily
	apparent.</font></p>

	<p><font>In section (603), mention is made of a
	so called &quot;Nominative Absolute&quot;; it is explained in a
	P&#257;li work called the Niruttid&#299;pan&#299;, printed in Rangoon. M.
	Monier Williams also mentions it in the preface to his Sanskrit
	Grammar.</font></p>

	<p><font>Much official and literary work in
	connection with duties did not allow me to see this second
	edition through the press. Professor Maung Tin, of the Rangoon
	College, has most graciously undertaken this onerous work, and he
	has read and corrected every single proof. Persons who have had
	experience in proof-reading, above all of a book of such a
	character as the present one, will readily understand the
	magnitude of the service done me by my old pupil, and for which I
	beg here to thank him most sincerely.</font></p>

	<p><font color="#0000FF"><strong>Preface</strong></font></p>

	<p><font>This grammar was written for my pupils
	in the Rangoon College, to facilitate their work and make the
	study of the P&#257;li language easier for them. There is, to my
	knowledge no P&#257;li grammar suited to the requirements of
	students who do not know even the elements of Sanskrit, and to
	place into their hands grammars such as that of Muller of
	Frankfurter and of Minayef, which are intended for Sanskrit
	dilettanti, would serve rather to puzzle, than to help them;
	moreover, these grammars are not quite complete, consisting
	merely of the inflections of nouns and verbs. Mr James Gray's
	grammar, which was written with the same purpose as the one now
	presented to the public has long been out of stock; it had two
	drawbacks; the P&#257;li was all in Burmese characters, and it
	was too elementary to help the student in acquiring a thorough
	mastery of the language.</font></p>

	<p><font>It is, I think, the first time, that
	Derivation has been treated systematically and fully in a
	European work; the chapter on Syntax. too, though not quite
	exhaustive (to make it so would require a special volume) is a
	novel feature, considering that Syntax has never as yet been
	treated of, except in one single instance (P&#257;li Grammar by
	H. H. Tilby, Rangoon Baptist College, 1899.), and very briefly
	and with no examples whatever given in illustration of the rules.</font></p>

	<p><font>One of the greatest difficulties
	experienced has been to explain some forms (principally in
	Assimilation and Verbs), without the help of Sanskrit; scholars
	well understand how P&#257;li forms, thus explained, seem
	arbitrary, not to say incomprehensible in some cases; so that,
	although my avowed object was to write for students who do not
	know the first elements of Sanskrit grammar, I have thought it
	advisable to scatter here and there in the body of the work, a
	few explanations bearing on Sanskrit grammar, to make some forms
	better understood. But the student is perfectly free to skip them
	over and to assume the P&#257;li forms just as they are given; I
	would, however recommend him to peruse them at a second reading.</font></p>

	<p><font>Each rule, throughout, is profusely
	illustrated with examples taken from the j&#257;takas and from
	other books, and indigenous P&#257;li grammars. The paragraphs
	have been numbered and, to facilitate reference in looking up the
	rules, they are quoted whenever necessary, to render more easy
	the study of that part of the grammar which the student is
	actually reading.</font></p>

	<p><font>Grammatical discoveries are not to be
	expected, but scholars will find in the work now issued, a few
	things which have never before appeared in European grammars of
	P&#257;li.</font></p>

	<p><font>The following indigenous P&#257;li
	grammars have been consulted: saddan&#299;ti, mah&#257;r&#363;pasiddhi,
	mah&#257;r&#363;pasiddhi &#7789;ik&#257;, akhy&#257;tapadam&#257;l&#257;,
	moggall&#257;na, kacch&#257;yana, ga&#7735;on pyan.</font></p>

	<p><font>I have availed myself of all the
	grammars published in Europe to which I could have access.</font></p>

	<p id="append"><font color="#0000FF"><strong>Appendix</strong></font></a></p>

	<p><font>Here is a collection of dictionary
	definitions of some of the terms that can be found in this book.</font></p>

	<p><font>Ablative: Of, relating to, or being a
	grammatical case indicating separation, direction away from,
	sometimes manner or agency, and the object of certain verbs. It
	is found in Latin and other Indo-European languages.</font></p>

	<p><font>Ablative absolute: In Latin grammar, an
	adverbial phrase syntactically independent from the rest of the
	sentence and containing a noun plus a participle, an adjective,
	or a noun, both in the ablative case.</font></p>

	<p><font>Accusative: Of, relating to, or being
	the case of a noun, pronoun, adjective, or participle that is the
	direct object of a verb or the object of certain prepositions.</font></p>

	<p><font>Active: Indicating that the subject of
	the sentence is performing or causing the action expressed by the
	verb. Used of a verb form or voice.</font></p>

	<p><font>Adjective: Any of a class of words used
	to modify a noun or other substantive by limiting, qualifying, or
	specifying and distinguished in English morphologically by one of
	several suffixes, such as -able, -ous, -er, and -est, or
	syntactically by position directly preceding a noun or nominal
	phrase, such as white in a white house.</font></p>

	<p><font>Aorist: A form of a verb in some
	languages, such as Classical Greek or Sanskrit, that in the
	indicative mood expresses past action.</font></p>

	<p><font>Conjugate: To inflect (a verb) in its
	forms for distinctions such as number, person, voice, mood, and
	tense.</font></p>

	<p><font>Dative: Of, relating to, or being the
	grammatical case that in some Indo-European languages, such as
	Latin and Russian, as well as in some non-Indo-European
	languages, marks the recipient of action and is used with
	prepositions or other function words corresponding in meaning to
	English to and for.</font></p>

	<p><font>Declension: Linguistics. a. In certain
	languages, the inflection of nouns, pronouns, and adjectives in
	categories such as case, number, and gender.</font></p>

	<p><font>Genitive: Of, relating to, or
	designating a case that expresses possession, measurement, or
	source.</font></p>

	<p><font>Gerund: A verbal noun analogous to the
	Latin gerund, such as the English form ending in -ing when used
	as a noun, as in singing in We admired the choir's singing.</font></p>

	<p><font>Grammar: The system of inflections,
	syntax, and word formation of a language.</font></p>

	<p><font>Inflection: a. An alternation of the
	form of a word by adding affixes, as in English dogs from dog, or
	by changing the form of a base, as in English spoke from speak,
	that indicates grammatical features such as number, person, mood,
	or tense. b. The paradigm of a word. c. A pattern of forming
	paradigms, such as noun inflection or verb inflection.</font></p>

	<p><font>Interrogative: Of, relating to, or being
	an element or construction used to ask a question: an
	interrogative adverb; an interrogative particle.</font></p>

	<p><font>Locative: Of, relating to, or being a
	grammatical case in certain inflected languages that indicates
	place in or on which or time at which, as in Latin dom&#146;, 'at
	home.'</font></p>

	<p><font>Nominative: Of, relating to, or
	belonging to a case of the subject of a finite verb (as I in I
	wrote the letter) and of words identified with the subject of a
	copula, such as a predicate nominative (as children in These are
	his children).</font></p>

	<p><font>Optative: Of, relating to, or being a
	mood of verbs in some languages, such as Greek, used to express a
	wish. Designating a statement using a verb in the subjunctive
	mood to indicate a wish or desire, as in Had I the means, I would
	do it.</font></p>

	<p><font>Present Participle: A participle
	expressing present action, formed in English by the infinitive
	plus -ing and used to express present action in relation to the
	time indicated by the finite verb in its clause, to form
	progressive tenses with the auxiliary be, and to function as a
	verbal adjective.</font></p>

	<p><font>Passive: Of, relating to, or being a
	verb form or voice used to indicate that the grammatical subject
	is the object of the action or the effect of the verb. For
	example, in the sentence They were impressed by his manner, were
	impressed is in the passive voice.</font></p>

	<p><font>Participle: A form of a verb that in
	some languages, such as English, can function independently as an
	adjective, as the past participle baked in We had some baked
	beans, and is used with an auxiliary verb to indicate tense,
	aspect, or voice, as the past participle baked in the passive
	sentence The beans were baked too long.</font></p>

	<p><font>Past Participle: A verb form indicating
	past or completed action or time that is used as a verbal
	adjective in phrases such as baked beans and finished work and
	with auxiliaries to form the passive voice or perfect and
	pluperfect tenses in constructions such as She had baked the
	beans and The work was finished. Also called perfect participle.</font></p>

	<p><font>Prefix: An affix, such as dis- in
	disbelieve, put before a word to produce a derivative word or an
	inflected form.</font></p>

	<p><font>Pronominal: Of, relating to, or
	functioning as a pronoun. Resembling a pronoun, as by specifying
	a person, place, or thing, while functioning primarily as another
	part of speech. His in his choice is a pronominal adjective.</font></p>

	<p><font>Radical: Arising from or going to a root
	or source; basic: a radical flaw in a plan; chose the radical
	solution of starting all over again.</font></p>

	<p><font>Reflective: designating or expressing a
	grammatical relation in which a verb's subject and an object in
	the sentence refer to the same person or thing, serving to
	indicate that the action of the verb is directed back to the
	subject Ex. &quot;Gary hurt himself&quot;, &quot;Jane threw a
	party for herself&quot;.</font></p>

	<p><font>Sanskrit: An ancient Indic language that
	is the language of Hinduism and the Vedas and is the classical
	literary language of India.</font></p>

	<p><font>Substantive: 1. Expressing or
	designating existence; for example, the verb to be. 2.
	Designating a noun or noun equivalent.</font></p>

	<p><font>Suffix: An affix added to the end of a
	word or stem, serving to form a new word or functioning as an
	inflectional ending, such as -ness in gentleness, -ing in
	walking, or -s in sits.</font></p>

	<p><font>Vocative: Relating to or being a
	grammatical case used in Latin and certain other languages to
	indicate the person or thing being addressed.</font></p>

	<p><font>Verbal Adjective: An adjective that is
	derived from a verb and that in some constructions, participial
	phrases for example, preserves the verb's syntactic features,
	such as transitivity and the capability of taking nominal or
	verbal complements.</font></p>

	Practical Grammar of the P&#257;li Language<br>
	Chapter 1</strong></font></p>

	<p><font color="#FF0000" size="4"><strong>The
	Alphabet</strong></font></p>

	<p><font size="3"><strong>1.</strong> The
	P&#257;li Alphabet consists of 41 letters; namely: 6 vowels, 2
	diphthongs, 32 consonants and one accessory nasal sound called
	Niggah&#299;ta.</font></p>

	<p><a name="2."><font size="3"><strong>2.</strong></font></a><font
	size="3"> The vowels are divided into short and
	long; the short vowels are: a, i, u; the long vowels are &#257;,
	&#299;, &#363;.</font></p>

	<p><font size="3"><strong>3.</strong> The value
	of a long vowel is about twice that of a short one, so that it
	takes twice as much time to pronounce a long vowel as to
	pronounce a short one.</font></p>

	<p><font size="3"><strong>4.</strong> The sign of
	a long vowel is a dash placed over it. Besides the above three
	long vowels, all short vowels are prosodically long that come
	before a conjunct or double consonant: for instance, in bhikkhu,
	ra</font><font>&#7789;&#7789;</font><font size="3">ha and puppha, the -i before kkh, the -a before </font><font>&#7789;&#7789;</font><font size="3">h and
	the -u before pph are said to be long.</font></p>

	<p><font size="3">Long also are a, i, u when
	followed by &#7747; (niggah&#299;ta), as in: puppha&#7747;, a flower; cakkhu&#7747;,
	eye; kapi&#7747;, monkey.</font></p>

	<p><font size="3"><strong>5.</strong> The two
	diphthongs are e and o, which are always long. They are
	diphthongs only grammatically, because they are supposed to be
	the product of the meeting and contraction of two vowels (a + i =
	e; and a + u = o). In reality and practically they are simple
	vowels.</font></p>

	<p><a name="6."><font size="3"><strong>6.</strong></font></a><font
	size="3"> The consonants are divided into: 25
	mutes, 5 semi-vowels, one sibilant and one aspirate (spirant).
	The 25 mutes are divided, according to the place of their
	formation and utterance, into 5 groups of 5 letters each.</font></p>

	The Dentals are so called from their being pronounced with the

	The Labials are formed by means of the lips;<br>
	The Nasals are sounded through the nose;<br>
	The Sibilant has a hissing sound; and,<br>
	The Spirant a strong aspirated breathing.<br>
	The Mutes are so called on account of their not being readily
	pronounced without the aid of a vowel;<br>
	Surds, are hard, flat, and toneless;<br>
	The Sonants are soft and uttered with a checked tone;<br>
	The Liquids, readily combine with other consonants: (except,

	<p><a name="14."><font size="3"><strong>14.</strong></font></a><font
	size="3"> Sandhi (union) is that part of the
	grammar which treats of the euphonic changes that occur when one
	word is joined to another.</font></p>

	<p><font size="3"><strong>15.</strong> Generally
	these changes occur<br>
	(a) When a word ending in a vowel is joined to a word beginning
	with a vowel.<br>
	(b) When a word ending in a vowel, is joined to another word
	beginning with a consonant.<br>
	(c) When a word ending in niggah&#299;ta (&#7747;) is followed by a word
	beginning either with a vowel or with a consonant.</font></p>

	<p><font size="3"><strong>16.</strong> From the
	above it will be seen that sandhi is of three kinds:<br>
	(I) Vowel-sandhi, (II) Mixed sandhi and (III) Niggah&#299;ta-sandhi.</font></p>

	<p><font size="3">Remarks. It is not absolutely
	necessary that the student should master thoroughly the rules of
	sandhi before beginning the study of the other chapters; but he
	should read them once carefully, and always refer to them
	whenever in the course of his reading he finds forms and

	<p><font color="#FF0000" size="4"><strong>Assimilation</strong></font></p>

	<p><font size="3"><strong>51.</strong> The matter
	included in this chapter should perhaps have come under the head
	of &quot;sandhi&quot; for assimilation is nothing but changes
	that occur for the sake of euphony.</font></p>

	<p><font size="3">I have remarked that, although
	the rules of sandhi, as explained in the preceding chapter, are
	readily understood and applied by the young students, the laws of
	assimilation puzzle them not a little, and retard their reading
	much more than is necessary. The difficulty thus experienced
	arises from their ignorance of Sanskrit, without at least a
	slight knowledge of which, the study of P&#257;li becomes
	sensibly more difficult.</font></p>

	<p><font size="3">In the following paragraphs, I
	shall try and explain as succinctly and as clearly as possible,
	the rules of assimilation. The student cannot be too much
	recommended to study thoroughly this chapter and to refer to it
	constantly in the course of his studies.</font></p>

	<p><font size="3"><strong>52.</strong>
	Assimilation is the blending into one of two consonantal sounds.
	It involves the change of one sound to another of the same
	series, but sometimes also to a sound of another series. (See
	chart at end of para 6).</font></p>

	<p><font size="3"><strong>53.</strong>
	Assimilation is of two kinds:<br>
	(i) The initial consonant is assimilated to the final consonant
	of the preceding word. This is called Progressive Assimilation.<br>
	(ii) The final consonant of the preceding word is assimilated to
	the initial consonant of the word that follows. This is called
	Regressive Assimilation.</font></p>

	<p><font color="#FF0000" size="3"><strong>I.
	Progressive Assimilation<br>
	</strong></font><font size="3">(a) &#8730;lag (to
	cling) + na = lagna = lagga (clung).<br>
	(b) &#8730;budh (to know) + ta = budhta = buddha (known).</font></p>

	<p><font size="3">It will be remarked that in
	example (a) the n (dental) has been assimilated to the g which
	belongs to another series (gutteral).</font></p>

	<p><font size="3">In (b), the t, become d,
	assimilates to the preceding dh, both being sounds of the same
	series (dentals).</font></p>

	<p><font color="#FF0000" size="3"><strong>II.
	Regressive Assimilation</strong></font><font size="3"><br>
	(a) &#8730;lip (to smear) + ta = lipta = litta (smeared).<br>
	(b) &#8730;dam (to subdue) + ta = damta = danta (subdued).</font></p>

	<p><font size="3">In these two examples, p in
	(a), is assimilated to initial t and passes to another series of
	sounds.</font></p>

	<p><font size="3">In (b), m likewise passing to
	another series, assimilates itself to t and becomes n.</font></p>

	<p><font color="#0000FF" size="3"><strong>General
	Rules of Assimilation</strong></font></p>

	<p><font size="3"><strong>54.</strong>
	Assimilation takes place mostly in the formation of the Passive
	Voice, the Passive Perfect Participle, the base of verbs of the
	third conjugation, of the Infinitive, Gerund, the Potential
	Passive Participle and in the formation of the Desiderative; also
	under the influence of certain suffixes in the derivation of
	words.</font></p>

	<p><font size="3"><strong>55.</strong> In
	P&#257;li, regressive Assimilation is the more common.</font></p>

	<p><font size="3"><strong>56.</strong> When a
	mute meets with an initial mute (non-nasal), there is regressive
	assimilation generally, that is the first consonant is
	assimilated to the second:<br>
	(i) sak + ta = sakta = satta.<br>
	(ii) sak + thi = sakthi = satthi.</font></p>

	<p><font size="3"><strong>57.</strong> A gutteral
	assimilates the following dental:<br>
	(i) lag + na = lagna = lagga.<br>
	(ii) sak + no = sakno = sakko + ti = sakkoti.</font></p>

	<p><font size="3"><strong>58.</strong> A gutteral
	assimilates a final dental:<br>
	(i) ud + kam&#257;peti = ukkam&#257;peti.<br>
	(ii) tad + karo = takkaro.<br>
	(iii) ud + gacchati = uggacchati.</font></p>

	<p><font size="3"><strong>59.</strong> A final
	palatal</font><font color="#FF0000" size="3">*</font><font
	size="3"> being followed by a dental surd or
	sonore, assimilates it into a lingual:<br>
	(i) &#8730;maj + ta = ma&#7789;&#7789;ha or ma&#7789;&#7789;a.<br>
	(ii) &#8730;pucch + ta = pu&#7789;&#7789;ha.<br>
	(iii) &#8730;icch + ta = i&#7789;&#7789;ha.</font></p>

	<p><font size="3">(a) j however sometimes is
	assimilated to the following t:<br>
	(iv) &#8730;bhuj + ta = bhutta.</font></p>

	<p><font size="3">(b) c also becomes assimilated
	to t:<br>
	(v) &#8730;muc + ta = mutta.</font></p>

	<p><font color="#FF0000" size="3">*</font><font
	size="3">To better understand these changes, the
	student ought to bear in mind that no word can end in a palatal
	nor in h, because these letters are not primitive letters the
	palatals have sprung into existence from the contact of gutteral
	consonants with certain vowels; and h represents an old gh and is
	the aspirate of j; the original gutterals, therefore, reappear at
	the end of words either pure or transformed into a lingual, and
	then assimilate or are assimilated by the following dental. For
	instance:<br>
	&#8730;pucch = pu&#7789;h + ta = pu&#7789;&#7789;ha, but, &#8730;muc = muk + ta = mukta =
	mutta;<br>
	&#8730;bhuj = bhuk + ta = bhukta = bhutta;<br>
	again, &#8730;maj = ma&#7789; (&#7789; = Sansk. s) + ta = ma&#7789;&#7789;a.<br>
	In Sansk., &#8730;m¨j + ta = mrsta = P&#257;li: ma&#7789;&#7789;a.</font></p>

	<p><font size="3"><strong>60.</strong> But an
	initial palatal assimilates a final dental in palatal:<br>
	ud + cinati = uccinati.<br>
	ud + ched&#299; = ucched&#299;.<br>
	ud + jala = ujjala.<br>
	ud + jh&#257;yati = ujjh&#257;yati.</font></p>

	<p><font size="3"><strong>61.</strong> A final
	lingual assimilates a following surd dental, (t): &#8730;ku&#7789;&#7789; + ta =
	ku&#7789;&#7789;ha.</font></p>

	<p><font size="3"><strong>62.</strong> A final
	dental is assimilated to the following consonant:<br>
	(i) ud + ga&#7751;h&#257;ti = ugga&#7751;h&#257;ti.<br>
	(ii) ud + khipati = ukkhipati.<br>
	(iii) ud + chindati = ucchindati.<br>
	(iv) ud + jh&#257;yati = ujjh&#257;yati.<br>
	(v) ud + s&#257;ha = uss&#257;ha.<br>
	(vi) ud + ti&#7751;&#7751;a = utti&#7751;&#7751;a.<br>
	(vii) ud + loketi = ulloketi.</font></p>

	<p><font size="3"><strong>63.</strong> When
	initial t, follows a sonant aspirate, the assimilation is
	progressive: the final sonant aspirate loses its aspiration, the
	following t (surd) becomes sonant, viz; d, and taking the
	aspiration which the final sonant has lost, becomes dh.</font></p>

	<p><font color="#0000FF" size="3"><u>Examples</u></font></p>

	<p><font size="3">&#8730;rudh + ta = rudh + da = rud +
	dha = ruddha.</font></p>

	<p><font size="3">Remark. In the case of final
	bh, initial t having become dh, regressive assimilation takes
	place;<br>
	&#8730;labh + ta = labh + d = lab + dha = laddha.</font></p>

	<p><font size="3"><strong>64.</strong> Before an
	initial dental surd, a gutteral or a labial surd unaspirate is
	generally assimilated:<br>
	(i) tap + ta = tapta = tatta.<br>
	(ii) sak + ta = sakta = satta.<br>
	(iii) sakt + hi = sakthi = satthi.<br>
	(iv) kam + ta = kamta = kanta.</font></p>

	<p><font size="3"><strong>65</strong>. An initial
	labial generally assimilates a preceding dental surd or sonant
	unaspirate:<br>
	(i) tad + purisa = tappurisa.<br>
	(ii) ud + bhijjati = ubbhijjati.<br>
	(iii) ud + pajjati = uppajjati.<br>
	(iv) ud + majjati = ummajjati.</font></p>

	<p><font size="3"><strong>66.</strong> A final
	labial may assimilate an initial nasal: p&#257;p + no + ti =
	p&#257;pno + ti = pappoti</font></p>

	<p><font color="#0000FF" size="3"><strong>Assimilation
	of Nasals</strong></font></p>

	<p><font size="3"><strong>67.</strong> Final m
	before t is assimilated: &#8730;gam + tv&#257; = gamtv&#257; =
	gantv&#257;.</font></p>

	<p><font size="3"><strong>68.</strong> The group
	sm is preserved: tasmi&#7747;, bhasm&#257;, asm&#257;, usm&#257;.</font></p>

	<p><font size="3"><strong>69.</strong> An initial
	nasal assimilates a preceding dental: ud + magga = un + magga =
	ummagga.</font></p>

	<p><font size="3">Remark. Here final d, being
	before a nasal, is first changed to the nasal of its class, that
	is n, and this n (dental) is then assimilated to m (labial). So
	for gantv&#257; in (67).<br>
	(i) ud + nadati = unnadati.<br>
	(ii) &#8730;chid + na = chinna.</font></p>

	<p><font color="#0000FF" size="3"><strong>Assimilation
	of Y</strong></font></p>

	<p><font size="3"><strong>70.</strong> y is
	regularly assimilated to the preceding consonant by Progressive
	Assimilation.</font></p>

	<p><font size="3"><strong>71.</strong> The
	assimilation of y takes place principally in the Passive Voice in
	the formation of verbal bases of the 3rd conjugation, of some
	gerunds and of numerous derived nouns.<br>
	(i) &#8730;gam + ya = gamya = gamma.<br>
	(ii) &#8730;pac + ya = pacya = pacca.<br>
	(iii) &#8730;mad + ya = madya = majja.<br>
	(iv) &#8730;bha&#7751; + ya = bhanya = bha&#241;&#241;a.<br>
	(v) &#8730;div + ya = divva = dibba.<br>
	(vi) &#8730;kh&#257;d + ya = kh&#257;dya = khajja (34).<br>
	(vii) &#8730;khan + ya = khanya = kha&#241;&#241;a.</font></p>

	<p><font size="3"><strong>72.</strong> This rule
	holds good also in the middle of a compound word: final i having
	become y by Rule 27 (i) (a), is assimilated to the preceding,
	consonant, and the following word is joined on to form a
	compound.</font></p>

	<p><font size="3"><strong>73.</strong> By far the

	Strengthening Process</strong></font></p>

	<p><font size="3"><strong>103.</strong>
	Strengthening is the process of changing a vowel sound into
	another vowel sound.</font></p>

	<p><font size="3"><strong>104.</strong> The
	vowels which undergo strengthening are: a, i, &#299;, u and &#363;.</font></p>

	<p><font size="3"><strong>105.</strong> Thus: a
	being strengthened, becomes &#257;.<br>
	i being strengthened, becomes e.<br>
	&#299; being strengthened, becomes e.<br>
	u being strengthened, becomes o.<br>
	&#363; being strengthened, becomes o.</font></p>

	<p><font size="3"><strong>106.</strong> The
	result thus obtained is also called gu&#7751;a (quality).</font></p>

	<p><font size="3"><strong>107.</strong>
	Therefore, the gu&#7751;a of a is &#257;, that of i and &#299; is e, that
	of u and &#363; is o.</font></p>

	<p><font size="3"><strong>108.</strong> Further,
	as we already know (by rules 27(i)a, 27(ii)b), final e and o when
	followed by a vowel may be changed into their semi-vowel + that
	vowel.</font></p>

	<p><font size="3"><strong>109.</strong> The
	following table of these very useful changes should be borne in
	mind.</font></p>
	<div align="center"><center>

	<p><font size="3"><strong>110.</strong>
	Strengthening occurs frequently in the formation of verbal bases,

	under the influence of certain suffixes.</font></p>

	<p><font size="3">Remarks. In the derivation of

	<p><font size="3"><strong>112.</strong>
	Metathesis is the transposition of letters or of syllables in a

	<p><font size="3"><strong>116.</strong> (a)
	Declension is the adding to the stems of Nouns and Adjectives
	certain suffixes which show, case, gender and number.<br>
	(b) The stem or base of a noun is that noun as it stands before
	any suffix has been added to it.<br>
	(c) P&#257;li has three genders: the Masculine, the Feminine and
	the Neuter.<br>
	(d) P&#257;li does not strictly follow the natural division of
	male, female, etc, in assigning gender to nouns, many nouns which
	are Masculine in English are Feminine or Neuter in P&#257;li and
	vice-versa; a great number of nouns which we consider as neuter
	are, some Masculine, some Feminine in P&#257;li. This is called
	grammatical gender.<br>
	(e) There are two numbers: the singular and the plural.<br>
	(f) There are eight cases.</font></p>

	<p><font size="3">1. Nominative, showing the
	subject of the sentence.<br>
	2. Genitive, showing possession (of 's).<br>
	3. Dative, showing the object or person to or for whom something
	is given or done.<br>
	4. Accusative, this is the object of the sentence.<br>
	5. Instrumentive, shows the object or person with or by whom
	something is performed.<br>
	6. Ablative, generally showing separation, expressed by from.<br>
	7. Locative, showing place (in, on, at, upon, etc.).<br>
	8. Vocative, used in addressing persons.</font></p>

	<p><font size="3">Remarks. The student will find
	fuller explanations of the uses of the cases in the chapter on
	Syntax.</font></p>

	<p><font size="3"><strong>117.</strong> The
	declension of nouns is divided into two great divisions:<br>
	(a) Vowel-declension, comprising all the stems that end in a
	vowel.<br>
	(b) Consonantal, declension, in which are included all the stems
	ending in a consonant.<br>
	(c) Vowel-declension is generally, for the sake of clearness,
	divided again into three classes:<br>
	(i) the declension of stems ending in a or &#257;.<br>
	(ii) the declension of stems ending in i or &#299;.<br>
	(iii) the declension of stems ending in u or &#363;.</font></p>

	(a) The true Dat. sing. in &#257;ya has now generally been
	displaced by the suffix of the gen. ssa; the Dat. &#257;ya is
	almost equal to an lnfinitive and mostly denotes intention.<br>
	(b) sm&#257; and mh&#257; of the Abl. and smi&#7747; and mhi of the
	Loc. have been borrowed from the pronominal declension (see
	Declension of Pronouns).<br>
	(c) so is sometimes used also as an Abl. sing. suffix:<br>
	vaggaso, by groups, bh&#257;gaso, by share.<br>
	(d) s&#257; is also found as an Ins. sing. suffix, as:
	balas&#257;, by force, forcibly, talas&#257;, with the sole of
	the foot.<br>
	(e) The Nom. plur. in &#257;se, very scarce, corresponds to the
	Vedic Nom. plur.<br>
	(f) ebhi, of the Ins. and Abl. plural, is mostly used in poetry,
	and probably comes from the Vedic -ebhis.<br>
	(g) Before o, Nom. sing., ehi, ebhi, Ins. and Abl. plur. and e,
	Acc. plur. final a of the stem is dropped:<br>
	deva + o = dev + o = devo, deva + ehi = dev + ehi = devehi.<br>
	(h) Before su, Loc. plur. final a of stem is changed to e<br>
	(i) In the Dat., Ins., Abl. and Loc. sing.; and in Nom. and Voc.
	plur. the usual rules of sandhi are regularly followed:</font></p>

	(a) The form of the Gen. sing. in u: satthu, is the base employed
	in the formation of compound words.<br>
	(b) Stems ending in ar (Sansk. ¨) have their Nom. sing. in
	&#257; as pitar (=Sansk. pit¨), Nom. sing. pit&#257;; so
	m&#257;tar (=m&#257;t¨), Nom. sing. m&#257;t&#257;. Their base
	in composition is generally in u.<br>
	(c) Before suffix to of the Abl. sing. stems in ar often take the
	vowel i; as pitito, m&#257;tito, and sometimes a base piti,
	m&#257;ti is used in composition: pitipakkhe.<br>
	(d) Some words whose stem is in ar, follow the a declension (of
	deva), for instance: sallakatta (stem sallakattar), a physician;
	kattara (stem kattarar), a weak person; sota (stem sotar), a
	hearer.</font></p>

	<p><font size="3">Remark. In the sense of fold,
	the compound being an adjective, is treated as such and is

	<p><font>Remarks.<br>
	(a) The singular base of aha</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> is mad according to Sanskrit commentators; it is
	properly ma and mam. Pronominal derivatives are, however, formed
	from the three bases: mad, mam and ma, the latter sometimes with
	the a lengthened: m</font><font size="3">&#257;</font><font> (See Pronominal Derivation at the end of the
	present chapter.)<br>
	(b) The form me, of the Gen., Dat., Ins., Abl., Sing., is
	enclitic; it is never used at the beginning of a sentence.<br>
	(c) The form no, of the same cases in the plural is also
	enclitic, and never used at the beginning of a sentence.<br>
	(d) The plural base is amha, or amhad.</font></p>

	<p><font>Remarks.<br>
	(a) In the Gen., Dat., Abl., and Loc. singular for the Masc, and
	Neut, a form from pronominal stem: a, is also used: assa, asm</font><font
	size="3">&#257;</font><font>,
	asmi</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> in the Feminine too, for the Gen., Dat. and Loc.
	singular: ass</font><font size="3">&#257;</font><font>, assa</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> (Loc.).<br>
	(b) ln the Neuter, the form tad is used mostly in compound words,
	as:<br>
	tad (=ta</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font>) karo=takkaro, &quot;doing this&quot;, and also
	before a vowel.<br>
	(c) It will have been remarked that the stem ta, 3rd personal
	pronoun (so, s</font><font size="3">&#257;</font><font>, ta</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font>), is also used as a demonstrative.<br>
	(d) ta is the base or stem of so, s</font><font size="3">&#257;</font><font>, ta</font><font
	size="3">&#7747;</font><font>; as
	above said (Note b), the form tad of the base is also used.<br>
	(e) Very often, the above pronoun may be translated as the
	Definite Pronoun.<br>
	(f) It is, too, often used pleonastically with the pronouns aha</font><font
	size="3">&#7747;</font><font> and tva</font><font
	size="3">&#7747;</font><font>, as are,
	in fact, most Demonstrative Pronouns; for instance:<br>
	so'ha</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> = this I, viz., I.<br>
	tassa me (Dat.) = to this me, viz., to me.<br>
	s</font><font size="3">&#257;</font><font>'yam (=s</font><font size="3">&#257;</font><font> aya</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font>) ta</font><font size="3">&#7751;</font><font>h</font><font size="3">&#257; </font><font>= This longing.<br>
	(g) att</font><font size="3">&#257;</font><font> self; own (154), is, in its oblique cases, very

	<p><font><strong>340.</strong> The suffix dikkha,
	has the same meaning as disa, etc. It is obtained by assimilation
	from the Sanskrit d¨k·a.</font></p>

	<p><font>Hence we have also the forms:<br>
	t</font><font size="3">&#257;</font><font>dikkha = t</font><font size="3">&#257;</font><font>disa.<br>
	k</font><font size="3">&#299;</font><font>dikkha = k</font><font size="3">&#299;</font><font>disa,<br>
	edikkha = edisa,<br>
	</font><font size="3">&#299;</font><font>dikkha = </font><font size="3">&#299;</font><font>disa, etc.</font></p>

	<p><font><strong>341.</strong> In edi, edisa,
	etc., the stem i is strengthened (105), in </font><font size="3">&#299;</font><font>disa, etc., it is
	merely lengthened (19).</font></p>

	<p><font><strong>342.</strong> Tara and tama,
	which are used for the comparison of adjectives (238), are also
	added to the interogative stem to form Pronominal Adjectives
	which, in meaning, differ but little from the single stem. Hence
	we have:<br>
	katara, which? what?<br>
	katama, which? what?</font></p>

	<p><font><strong>343.</strong> Some adjectives
	assume a rather anomalous form; such are, for instance: kittaka,
	tattaka, yattaka, ettaka, etc. A glance will suffice to show that
	they are formed on pronominal bases: ya, eta, ki, (ka), etc. The
	difficulty is to account (for most of them) for the double tt. It
	is obvious these adjectives were formed by adding the adjectival
	suffix ka to the Adverbial Instrumentive in t</font><font

	the doubling of the last t</font><font size="3">&#257;</font><font>; the </font><font size="3">&#257;</font><font> being shortened before ka, and the </font><font
	size="3">&#257;</font><font> of
	the first t</font><font size="3">&#257;</font><font> as well, according to euphonic laws. So that:</font></p>

	<p><font>kittaka, how much? How many? How great?<br>
	kittaka=k</font><font size="3">&#299;</font><font>vat</font><font size="3">&#257;</font><font>ka.<br>
	ettako, so great, so much, so many.<br>
	ettako=et</font><font size="3">&#257;</font><font>vat</font><font size="3">&#257;</font><font>ka.<br>
	yattaka, however much; however big or large.<br>
	yattaka=y</font><font size="3">&#257;</font><font>vat</font><font size="3">&#257;</font><font>ka.<br>
	tattaka, as many, as great, as big or large.<br>
	tattaka=t</font><font size="3">&#257;</font><font>vat</font><font size="3">&#257;</font><font>ka.</font></p>

	<p><font>But see also such Sansk. forms as:
	iyattaka (i-yad-ta-ka); kiyattaka (ki-yad-ta-ka).</font></p>

	<p><font>The form etta=ettaka, may be accounted
	for by the further dropping of final ka, the adverb etto, thence,
	is probably a contracted form etato (Abl. of eta</font><font
	size="3">&#7747;</font><font>); in
	ettavat</font><font size="3">&#257;</font><font>=et</font><font size="3">&#257;</font><font>vat, the consonant of the base is doubled.</font></p>

	Practical Grammar of the P&#257;li Language<br>
	Chapter 10</strong></font></p>

	<p><font color="#FF0000" size="4"><strong>Verbs</strong></font></p>

	<p><font><strong>354.</strong> Conjugation, or
	the inflection of verbs, consists in making the verbal root
	undergo certain changes in form, by the addition to it of certain
	prefixes and terminations to show the difference of Voice, of
	Tense, of Mode, of Person, and of Number.</font></p>

	<p><font><strong>355.</strong> There are two
	voices:<br>
	(1) The Active, called in P</font><font size="3">&#257;</font><font>li: parassapada (lit. a word for another) and<br>
	(2) The Reflective in P</font><font size="3">&#257;</font><font>li called attanopada (lit. a word for one's
	self).</font></p>

	<p><font><strong>356.</strong> The Active Voice,
	or parassapada may be said to be used, when the fruit or
	consequence of the action; expressed by the verb passes on to
	another person or thing other than the subject or agent; the
	Reflective Voice or attanopada, is used when the fruit or the
	consequence expressed by the verb accrues to no one else but to
	the the agent. The Reflective voice merely implies that the agent
	has the ability to do that action or suffer that state which is
	denoted by the Root.</font></p>

	<p><font><strong>357.</strong> It must here be
	remarked that the Reflective Voice has lost very much of its
	importance, and that the distinction between Active and
	Reflective has been almost if not altogether effaced, and that
	the choice between the Active or Reflective is mostly determined
	now by metrical exigencies. It therefore follows the Reflective
	Voice or the &quot;Middle Voice,&quot; as it is also called, is
	confined to poetry, and is but rarely found in prose.</font></p>

	<p><font><strong>358.</strong> There are six
	Tenses:<br>
	(1) The Present; and its preterite.<br>
	(2) The Imperfect; used originally to express a definite past.<br>
	(3) The Aorist, expressing time recently past. This is now the
	only true past tense in P</font><font size="3">&#257;</font><font>li, and is very extensively used.<br>
	(4) The Perfect, originally an indefinite past. This tense is of
	very rare occurrence.<br>
	(5) The Future, expressing future time in general and its
	preterite.<br>
	(6) The Conditional, expressing future time relatively to
	something that is past, and an action unable to be performed on
	account of some difficulty in the way of its execution.</font></p>

	<p><font><strong>359.</strong> There are three
	Modes of the Present Tense:<br>
	(1) The Indicative.<br>
	(2) The Imperative.<br>
	(3) The Optative.</font></p>

	<p><font><strong>360.</strong> The Present, the
	Perfect and the Future Tenses, have each a Participle, called
	after them:<br>
	(1) The Present Participle.<br>
	(2) The Perfect Participle.<br>
	(3) The Future Participle.</font></p>

	<p><font>Remarks. The Perfect Participle, mostly
	formed from the root, is principally of past and passive meaning;
	sometimes also of Neuter meaning.</font></p>

	<p><font><strong>361.</strong> There is also a
	Participle of Necessity, also called Future Passive Participle
	and Potential Participle, which is but a Verbal Adjective.</font></p>

	<p><font><strong>362.</strong> According to the
	Base on which they are formed the Present and the Future
	Participles may be active or passive in sense.</font></p>

	<p><font><strong>363.</strong> There are two
	Verbal Nouns:<br>
	(1) The Infinitive, in the Accusative Case-form; sometimes
	(rarely), in the Dative Case-form; which has nothing to do with
	the Conjugation and the Tense Systems; and has the sense of a
	regular infinitive.<br>
	(2) A Gerund so-called, which is but the Case-form of a
	derivative noun having the force of an absolute participle.</font></p>

	<p><font><strong>364.</strong> There are two
	Numbers: the Singular and the Plural.</font></p>

	<p><font><strong>365.</strong> There are three
	Persons: the First, Second and Third Persons.</font></p>

	<p><font><strong>366.</strong> From what has been
	said above, it will be seen that the tenses group themselves into
	four well defined classes or systems.<br>
	(1) The Present System, composed of:<br>
	(a) The Present Indicative, and its preterite.<br>
	(b) The Imperfect.<br>
	(c) The Present Imperative.<br>
	(d) The Present Optative.<br>
	(e) The Present Participle.<br>
	(2) The Aorist System, composed of:<br>
	(a) The Aorist Tense only.<br>
	(3) The Perfect System, comprising:<br>
	(a) The Perfect Tense.<br>
	(b) The Perfect Participle.<br>
	(4) The Future System composed of:<br>
	(a) The Future Tense.<br>
	(b) The Conditional.<br>
	(c) The Future Participle.</font></p>

	<p><font><strong>367.</strong> There is a
	division of the tenses, more fictitious than real, into
	&quot;Special Tenses&quot; and &quot;General Tenses&quot;. From
	such a division, one would be inclined to think that the former
	are formed on a special base or modified form of the root, and
	the latter, therefore, from the root itself. But such in fact is
	not the case, for it will later on be, remarked that the special
	and the general tenses not seldom interchange their bases.</font></p>

	<p><font><strong>368.</strong> As, however the
	Present System is by far the most important, and as it is made
	the basis of the different Conjugations or Classifications of
	Verbs, we will in the next section explain the formation of the
	several stems or bases of the Present System (otherwise called
	&quot;Special Tenses&quot;) of which there are ten, divided into
	Seven Conjugations. These bases are in consequence called
	&quot;Special Bases&quot;.</font></p>

	<p><font><strong>369.</strong> The Conjugation of
	Verbs is furthermore divided into Primitive and Derivative
	Conjugations.</font></p>

	special bases of the Present System</strong></font></p>

	<p><font color="#0000FF"><strong>Conjugation</strong></font></p>

	<p><font><strong>370.</strong> The verbs of the
	First Conjugation form the Present stem or base in four ways, as
	follows:</font></p>

	<p><font>(1) The roots end in a Consonant, and,
	to form the base or stem, simply add a.</font></p>

	<p><font color="#0000FF"><u>Examples</u></font><font><br>
	Roots. Bases.<br>
	&#8730;pac, to cook. paca.<br>
	&#8730;labh, to obtain. labha.<br>

	&#8730;rakkh, to keep, guard. rakkha.<br>
	&#8730;y</font><font size="3">&#257;</font><font>c, to entreat beg. y</font><font size="3">&#257;</font><font>ca.<br>

	&#8730;bhar, to carry. bhara.</font></p>

	<p><font><strong>371.</strong> To this division
	belong those roots which, ending in a consonant preceded by i or
	u, sometimes do, and sometimes do not strengthen the vowel (i,
	u).</font></p>

	<p><font color="#0000FF"><u>Examples</u></font><font><br>
	(Without Strengthening)<br>

	(With Strengthening)<br>
	Roots. Bases.<br>
	gup, to keep, watch. gopa.<br>
	subh, to shine, be beautiful. sobha.</font></p>

	<p><font>(2) The roots of this division do not
	take the conjugation sign a: the personal endings of the tenses
	are added directly to the root.</font></p>

	<p><font color="#0000FF"><u>Examples</u></font><font><br>
	Roots. Bases.<br>
	&#8730;y</font><font size="3">&#257;</font><font>, to go. y</font><font size="3">&#257;</font><font>.<br>

	size="3">&#257;</font><font>.<br>
	&#8730;br&#363;, to speak. br&#363;.</font></p>

	<p><font>Remarks. (a) To this class may be said
	to belong the roots ending in i, </font><font size="3">&#299;</font><font> or u, u which,
	when a is added to them, do not take their semi-vowel substitute,
	but are merely gunated (109, 104-107).</font></p>

	&#8730;ku, to sound. ko (or kava) (3rd Division).</font></p>

	<p><font>Remarks.<br>
	(b) To these transformed roots, which at first sight appear to be
	pure roots, the personal endings are added, as after the roots: y</font><font
	size="3">&#257;</font><font>, v</font><font
	size="3">&#257;</font><font>, &#7789;h</font><font
	size="3">&#257;</font><font>,
	etc., (2nd Division).<br>
	(c) So that these roots assume two special bases: one in e or
	aya, and one in o or ava, according as the last vowel is i, </font><font
	size="3">&#299;</font><font> or u,
	&#363;.</font></p>

	<p><font>(3) The roots of this division end in i,
	</font><font size="3">&#299;</font><font> or u, &#363; which, before the conjugational sign a,
	are respectively changed to ay and av (103-110).</font></p>

	(See above no. 2 Remarks (a, c).</font></p>

	<p><font>(4) The verbs of the Fourth division of
	the First Cojugation form their special bases by reduplicating
	the root.</font></p>

	<p><font color="#0000FF"><u>Examples</u></font><font><br>
	Roots. Bases.<br>

	&#8730;ha, to forsake. jah</font><font size="3">&#257;</font><font>.<br>
	&#8730;hu, to sacrifice. juho.</font></p>

	<p><font>Remark. These retain the long </font><font
	size="3">&#257;</font><font>
	before the personal endings of the present and of the Imperative.</font></p>

	<p><font><strong>372.</strong> The Rules of
	Reduplication are as follows:</font></p>

	<p><font>(1) Reduplication consists in the
	doubling of the first consonant in a root together with a vowel
	that follows it. If the root begins with a vowel, that vowel
	alone is reduplicated.</font></p>

	<p><font>(2) A gutteral is reduplicated by its
	corresponding palatal.</font></p>

	<p><font>(3) An unaspirate is always reduplicated
	by an unaspirate (See chart para 9) which means that an
	unaspirate is reduplicated by itself.</font></p>

	<p><font>(4) The initial h of a root, is
	reduplicated by j.</font></p>

	<p><font>(5) An aspirate is reduplicated by its
	unaspirate.</font></p>

	<p><font>(6) v is generally reduplicated by u.</font></p>

	<p><font>(7) A long vowel is shortened in the
	reduplicated syllable. That is:<br>
	(a) a or </font><font size="3">&#257;</font><font> takes a in reduplication, and sometimes:<br>
	(b) i or </font><font size="3">&#299;</font><font> takes i.<br>
	(c) u or &#363; takes u but sometimes a.<br>
	(d) i is occasionally changed to e.<br>
	(e) u is changed to o, sometimes.<br>
	(f) a of the root, following the first consonant, is sometimes
	lengthened to </font><font size="3">&#257;</font><font>.</font></p>

	<p><font color="#0000FF"><u>Examples</u></font><font><br>

	&#8730;ah, to say. (Rule 372, 1; 22) </font><font size="3">&#257;</font><font>ha.</font></p>

	<p><font>Remarks. The above rules of
	reduplication apply as well to the perfect tense; but as the
	perfect is very seldom used in P</font><font size="3">&#257;</font><font>li, the
	student ought not to assume existence of any form unless it be
	actually found in the course of his reading.</font></p>

	<p><font><strong>373.</strong> The Verbs of the
	Second Conjugation form their Special Bases by inserting niggah</font><font
	size="3">&#299;</font><font>ta before
	the last consonant of the root, and then adding a, as in the 1st
	conjugation. Niggahita follows the usual rules of sandhi (39).</font></p>

	<p><font color="#0000FF"><u>Examples</u></font><font><br>

	for the Assimilation of ya (70 ff.), are regularly applied.</font></p>

	&#8730;pas, to see. &#8730;pas + ya (76, i) = passa.<br>

	<p><font>ge = g</font><font size="3">&#257;</font><font>, to sing.<br>
	ve = v</font><font size="3">&#257;</font><font>, to weave.<br>
	jhe = jh</font><font size="3">&#257;</font><font>, to think, meditate.</font></p>

	<p><font><strong>375.</strong> The forms in </font><font
	size="3">&#257;</font><font> (g</font><font
	size="3">&#257;</font><font>,
	etc.) belong, as we have already seen, to the Third Conjugation,
	but those in e belong to the First Conjugation (3rd Division),
	and form their bases by the addition of a. Thus:</font></p>

	<p><font>ge + a = g</font><font size="3">&#257;</font><font>ya.<br>
	ve + a = v</font><font size="3">&#257;</font><font>ya.</font></p>

	<p><font>Remarks. Note well that final e + a = </font><font
	size="3">&#257;</font><font>ya
	with lengthening of the first a.</font></p>

	<p><font><strong>376.</strong> The Verbs of the

	it is found shortened.<br>
	(d) In a few cases the </font><font size="3">&#7751;</font><font> is de-lingualized and changed to the dental
	nasal, viz., n, following in this the analogy of the Sanskrit.</font></p>

	<p><font><strong>377.</strong> Verbs of the Fifth
	Conjugation form their bases by adding n</font><font size="3">&#257;</font><font> to the root,
	which as a rule ends in a vowel.</font></p>

	<p><font>Remarks.<br>
	(a) If the final vowel of the root is long (2), it is shortened
	before n</font><font size="3">&#257;</font><font>.<br>
	(b) Under the influence of a preceding Sanskrit r or ¨, this n</font><font

	size="3">&#257;</font><font> is
	retained in all the persons of the Present and Imperative, except
	in the 3rd Plural. The short form in na is also often found.</font></p>

	<p><font><strong>378.</strong> The Verbs of the
	Sixth Conjugation form their Special Bases by adding u to the
	root; this u generally strengthens to o, which before an ending
	beginning with a vowel is changed to va (27).</font></p>

	<p><font><strong>379.</strong> The Verbs of the

	root aya, which by contraction may be replaced by e. The forms in
	e are more commonly met than those in aya. (Compare: 1st
	conjugation 3rd Division).</font></p>

	<p><font>Remarks. The following should be
	carefully noted:<br>
	(a) When the radical vowel is u, it is changed to o, provided it
	be not followed by a Conjunct Consonant.<br>
	(b) Radical a, if followed by a single consonant, is generally
	lengthened, in some cases, however, it remains short.<br>
	(c) It will be perceived from the above that the verbs of the

	the endings being added, not after the root, but after the
	strengthened base (105), i or </font><font size="3">&#299;</font><font> having first been

	<p><font><strong>396.</strong> Some tenses of
	this verb are formed directly from the base; they will be given
	in their proper place.</font></p>

	<p><font>Remarks.<br>
	(a) Of &#8730;d</font><font size="3">&#257;</font><font>, we also find the bases dajj and de, formed by
	false analogy: dajj</font><font size="3">&#257;</font><font>mi, dajjasi, dajjati, dajj</font><font size="3">&#257;</font><font>ma, dajjatha,
	dajjanti, etc., demi, desi, deti; dema, detha, denti, etc.<br>
	(b) There is an anomalous form of the singular present very
	probably formed on the analogy of the plural: dammi, dasi, dati.<br>
	(c) The Reflective forms do not exist for most of the tenses,
	only a very few are met with: the first singular. and first
	plural: dade, dad</font><font size="3">&#257;</font><font>mase.<br>
	(d) In the root &#8730;&#7789;ha the final </font><font size="3">&#257;</font><font> of the base
	is preserved long only in the first singular and plural present.<br>
	Sing. Plur.<br>

	3. su&#7751;&#257;ti su&#7751;anti su&#7751;oti su&#7751;onti, sunvanti</font></p>

	<p><font>Remarks.<br>
	(a) The other Tenses are formed on the base: su&#7751;&#257; final
	&#257; being dropped before initial i and e, as: su&#7751;eyyami,
	su&#7751;eyy&#257;si etc, su&#7751;iss&#257;mi, su&#7751;iss&#257;ma,
	su&#7751;issasi, etc.<br>
	(b) &#8730;sak, to be able, belongs to this conjugation, but has
	developed several bases: sakku&#7751;&#257;ti with the k doubled;
	sakkoti, by assimilation (57) sak+no=sakno, sakko+ti=sakkoti.
	Similarly, there is a form sakk&#257;ti obtained by the same
	process; sak+n&#257;=sakna, sakk&#257;+ti=sakk&#257;ti: and still
	another form occurs, with short a: sakkati<br>
	(c) &#8730;&#257;p, to attain, with prefix pa (pa+&#257;p=p&#257;p),
	shows 3 forms: pappoti, p&#257;pu&#7751;&#257;ti, p&#257;pu&#7751;oti.
	&#8730;gah, to take, seize has for base: ga&#7751;h&#257; with metathesis
	(111, p.35): ga&#7751;h&#257;mi, ga&#7751;h&#257;si, etc.<br>
	(d) We have already said that the &#7751; is very often de-lingualised
	(376, d). That is to say, many of the roots belonging to the 4th
	Conjugation form their bases according to the 9th Conjugation of
	Sansk. verbs, by adding n&#257; to the root. For instance from
	&#8730;ci, to collect, to heap, we have: cin&#257;ti, to gather;
	ocin&#257;ti, ocinati, to pick up, to gather.<br>
	Remark that the base may be with short a as well as with long
	&#257; and that this is the case with many of the roots of this
	conjugation, cf. sa&#241;cinati, sa&#241;cinoti,
	sa&#241;cin&#257;ti, to accumulate.<br>
	(e) From &#8730;bh&#363; we have a verb abhisambhunati and abhisambhunoti,
	to obtain. The root of this verb is said by some grammarians to
	be Sansk. &#8730;bh¨&#299;, but this is most improbable. Some native
	grammarians give a root sambh&#363;, found only in the Dhammapada,
	not perceiving it is merely a compound of prefix sam+&#8730;bhu.</font></p>

	<p><font color="#FF0000"><strong>Fifth
	Conjugution</strong></font></p>

	<p><font><strong>402.</strong> &#8730;dh&#363; to shake;
	base dhun&#257;, (377).</font></p>

	Sing. Plur. Sing. Plur.<br>

	2. dhun&#257;si dhun&#257;tha dhunase dhunavhe<br>
	3. dhun&#257;ti dhunanti dhunate dhunante, dhunare.</font></p>

	<p><font>Remarks.<br>
	(a) Other Verbs belonging to this class are:<br>
	&#8730;j&#241;&#257;, j&#257;, &#241;&#257;, to know, base: j&#257;na.<br>
	&#8730;as, to eat, base : asn&#257;.<br>
	&#8730;mun=&#8730;man, to think, base: mun&#257;.<br>
	(b) The student will have remarked that the 4th and 5th
	Conjugations very often interchange their bases. This is owing to
	the false analogy of Sansk. roots.</font></p>

	<p><font color="#FF0000"><strong>Sixth

	1. karomi karoma<br>
	2. karosi karotha<br>
	3. karoti karonti</font></p>

	<p><font>Remarks.<br>
	(a) There are several bases of the root &#8730;kar as: karo, kara,
	kubb; the conjugation of this verb, as already said (378, a) will
	be given in full in the chapter on Defective Verbs.</font></p>

	<p><font>(b) The roots belonging to this Class
	are very few.</font></p>

	<p><font color="#FF0000"><strong>7th Conjugation</strong></font></p>

	<p><font><strong>404.</strong> The roots of the
	7th Conugation, as has been remarked above (379), have two bases:
	one in e and one in aya, which are conjugated exactly like the
	roots of the 1st Conjugation, 3rd Class, (See 393).</font></p>

	<p><font color="#FF0000"><strong>Irregular Bases</strong></font></p>

	<p><font>Some roots form their Special bases
	according to none of the above given rules; and they are in
	consequence called Irregular. The principal are here given.</font></p>

	<p><font>&#8730;gam, to go Special base gaccha.<br>

	<p><font color="#FF0000">*</font><font>These forms are given by the Saddan&#299;ti and the
	Akhyatapadam&#257;l&#257;. They are regularly conjugated like
	gaccha: ghamm&#257;mi, ghammasi ghammati;, etc,. ghagghami
	ghagghasi ghagghati; etc. ghammeyya, gagghe, gaggheyya, etc. The
	bases dakkha and daccha from &#8730;da, dis are formed on the false
	analogy of the future base, which we shall see when treating of
	the future. Most of the changes noticed above correspond to
	similar changes which occur in the 1st, 4th and 6th Conjugations
	of Sanskrit verbs.</font></p>

	<p><font color="#0000FF" size="4"><strong>The
	Aorist</strong></font></p>

	<p><font><strong>405.</strong> The Aorist is the
	only true past tense in P&#257;li. The Personal Endings of the
	Imperfect and those of the Aorist have become hopelessly mixed up
	and the native grammarians are at a loss to differentiate between
	the Imperfect and the Aorist; but the Aorist has generally
	superseded the Imperfect. There are many anomalies which the
	student cannot possibly understand without a slight knowedge of
	Sanskrit grammar; he need not however, be detained by these
	considerations just now. The usual Endings of the Imperfect have
	already been given (381); much will be achieved if he, for the
	present, devotes his attention to the following paragraphs.</font></p>

	<p><font><strong>406.</strong> The Aorist is
	supposed to be formed from the root but as a matter of fact, it
	is formed indif<br>
	ferently either from the root or from the base.</font></p>

	<p><font>Remarks.<br>
	(a) The student will remark, on comparing the above Endings with
	those of the Imperfect, that it is difficult to make out the
	Imperfect from the Aorist (the blending of Imperfect and Aorist
	is well known to students of Comparative Philology); the only
	criterion is, that the Imperfect is generally formed on the
	Special Base, and the Aorist, on the root. But even this is not
	an absolute criterion, and the fact remains that these two tenses
	can scarcely be differentiated.<br>
	(b) Of the above Endings, however, the most commonly used and
	most distinctively Aoristic are:<br>
	Sing. Plur.<br>
	1. i</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> imha, imh&#257;.<br>
	2. i ittha.<br>
	3. i i</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font>su, (isu</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font>).<br>
	(c) The nasal of a</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> is often omitted, and a alone remains.<br>
	(d) The Aorist of the great majority of verbs is formed with the
	desinences given in (b).</font></p>

	<p><font><strong>408.</strong> The Aorist may be
	divided into three types:<br>
	(i) Radical Aorist.<br>
	(ii) Stem or Base Aorist.<br>
	(&#299;i) Sigmatic Aorist.</font></p>

	<p><font>Remarks.<br>
	(a) As its name indicates, the Radical Aorist is formed directly
	from the root.<br>
	(b) The Stem Aorist is formed on the Special Base.<br>
	(c) The Sigmatic Aorist is distinguished by an s that comes
	between the root and the personal endings given in (407, b).</font></p>

	<p><font>(i) </font><font color="#FF0000"><strong>The Radical Aorist</strong></font></p>

	<p><font><strong>409.</strong> This Aorist is not
	very common. We will give a few examples. Let it be first
	remarked that the Aorist may also take the augment a before it,
	as does the imperfect.</font></p>

	<p><font><strong>410.</strong> from &#8730;gam, and
	&#8730;g&#257; and &#8730;g&#363; (subsidiary forms of &#8730;gam,) to go, we have:<br>
	(a) Sing. Plur.<br>
	1. aga</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font>, agam&#257;, agami</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> agumha<br>

	<p><font>Remark. For the doubling of initial &#7789;h
	see 33.</font></p>

	<p><font><strong>412.</strong> From &#8730;kar we
	find: aka</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> (1st singular), no doubt formed on the analogy
	of: ak&#257; (1st, 2nd and 3rd singular); ak&#257; being itself
	from the Vedic form: akar, the loss of the r is compensated by
	the lengthening of the final a.<br>
	In the 1st singular we also have: akara</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font>, akari</font><font
	size="3">&#7747;</font><font>.<br>
	In the plural: 2. akattha; 3. akaru</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font>, akar&#363;, akari</font><font
	size="3">&#7747;</font><font>su.</font></p>

	<p><font><strong>413.</strong> &#8730;h&#363; (a form of
	&#8730;bh&#363;) to be.<br>
	3rd singular: ah&#363;, ahu, and before a vowel, ahud.<br>
	1st plural: ahumh&#257;; 3rd plural: ahu</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font>.</font></p>

	<p><font><strong>414.</strong> &#8730;da.<br>
	1st singular: ad&#257;, which is also 2nd and 3rd singular.<br>
	In the plural we find: 3rd adu</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font>, ada</font><font
	size="3">&#7747;</font><font>su,
	ad&#257;su</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font>.</font></p>

	<p><font><strong>415.</strong> The augment a is
	not inseparable from the Aorist, so that we meet with such forms
	as:<br>
	g&#257;=ag&#257;, etc.</font></p>

	<p><font>(ii) </font><font color="#FF0000"><strong>Stem Aorist</strong></font></p>

	<p><font><strong>416.</strong> As has already

	<p><font><strong>417.</strong> The great bulk of

	(piva); it is therefore extremely common, both with and without
	the augment; let it be stated once for all that this augment is
	of much more frequent occurence in prose than in poetry; in the
	latter its retention or rejection is regulated by metrical
	exigencies. We will now give a few more examples:</font></p>

	<p><font>(iii) </font><font color="#FF0000"><strong>Sigmatic Aorist</strong></font></p>

	<p><font><strong>418.</strong> Sigmatic Aorist is
	formed by inserting s between the radical vowel or the vowel of
	the base and the personal endings given above (407, b).</font></p>

	<p><font><strong>419.</strong> So that we obtain
	the following desinences:<br>
	Sing. Plur.<br>
	1. si</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> (=s+i</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font>). simha (=s+imha).<br>
	2. si (=s+i). sittha (=s+ittha).<br>
	3. si (=s+i). su</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> (=s+u</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font>).</font></p>

	<p><font><strong>420.</strong> As will be readily
	understood, this formation of the Aorist is used with roots
	ending in vowels, and the s is inserted to join the endings to
	the root or to the base. It will be seen lower down, however,
	that they are added also to some roots ending in a consonant when
	the s becomes assimilated to that consonant.</font></p>

	<p><font><strong>421.</strong> The sigmatic
	desinences are used mostly with the Derivative Verbs, principally
	the Causative Verbs (See: Derivative Conjugation), which end in
	the vowel e. The verbs of the 7th Conjugation, which also end in
	e, form their Aorist in the same way.</font></p>

	<p><font color="#0000FF"><u>Examples</u></font><font><br>
	(Causative Verbs).</font></p>

	<p><font><strong>422.</strong> &#8730;h&#257;, to
	abandon, Causative base: h&#257;pe. &#8730;tas, to tremble, Causative

	Remarks. In the 3rd plural the form in i</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font>su is also
	frequent: h&#257;pesi</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font>su. t&#257;sesi</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font>su.<br>
	(Verbs of the 7th conjugation).</font></p>

	<p><font><strong>423.</strong> &#8730;cur, to steal,
	base: core. &#8730;kath, to tell, base: kathe.</font></p>

	2. coresi coresittha kathesi kathesittha<br>

	size="3">&#7747;</font><font>su</font></p>

	<p><font>Remarks.<br>
	(a) To the base in aya endings given in (407, b) may be added
	directly without the Insertion of sigmatic s, so that we have
	also:<br>
	Sing. Plur. Sing. Plur.<br>
	1. corayi</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> corayimha kathayi</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> kathayimha<br>
	2. corayi corayittha kathayi kathayittha<br>
	3. corayi corayu</font><font size="3">&#7747;, </font><font>corayi</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font>su kathayi kathayu</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font>, kathayi</font><font
	size="3">&#7747;</font><font>su<br>
	(b) This holds good for the Causative Verbs which have also a
	base in aya.</font></p>

	<p><font><strong>424.</strong> The Sigmatic
	Aorist desinences are placed after some roots which do not belong
	to the 7th conjugation or to the derivative verbs:<br>
	(i) After roots ending in a vowel, with or without the augment a.<br>
	(ii) After some roots ending in a Consonant, in which case the
	usual rules of assimilation (85) are strictly applied.</font></p>

	<p><font color="#0000FF"><u>Examples</u></font><font> of (ii)</font></p>

	<p><font><strong>425.</strong> At a first
	reading, the student had perhaps better leave unnoticed the few
	references. to Sanskrit Grammar which will be found in the next
	few paragrahs. Let him merely assume the forms as they are given:
	the more advanced student ought, of course, to read them with
	attention.</font></p>

	<p><font><strong>426.</strong> The s (initial) of
	Sigmatic desinences, as above given (419), assimilates itself to
	the last consonant of the root according to the usual rules of
	assimilation:<br>
	(a) From &#8730;dis=sanskrit .&#8730;d¨</font><font size="3">&#149;</font><font>, we find
	addakki=Sanskrit adrak-·-is.<br>
	The following forms are also found: addakkh&#299;, adakkhi, dakkhi.<br>
	(b) From &#8730;sak, to be able=Sankrit &#8730;</font><font size="3">&#149;</font><font>ak, we have
	sakkhi, asakkhi; Sanskrit=</font><font size="3">&#149;</font><font>ak-·-is.<br>
	(c) &#8730;kus, to revile=Sanskrit &#8730;kru</font><font size="3">&#149;</font><font>, gives
	akkocchi, but akkosi, without the sigmatic s, is also met with.<br>
	(d) &#8730;bha&#241;j, to break, gives Aorist bha&#7749;ki.</font></p>

	<p><font>Remark. The above examples will, I
	think, be sufficient to make the student understand the nature of
	the changes which occur in the formation of the Sigmatic Aorist
	when the roots end in a consonant; this consonant is generally s
	(=Sanskrit </font><font size="3">&#149;</font><font>) and sometimes j. In Sanskrit, final </font><font
	size="3">&#149;</font><font>
	(=P&#257;li s) is regularly changed to k before the initial s of
	verbal endings thus giving the group k·a, which in P&#257;li
	becomes kkha. Again, by another rule of Sanskrit phonetics, final
	j becomes g, and as no word can end in a mute sonant, this g is
	changed to its corresponding surd, that is to k. This class of
	the Sigmatic Aorist, however, is not numerous.</font></p>

	<p><font color="#0000FF" size="4"><strong>System
	of The Perfect</strong></font></p>

	<p><font><strong>427.</strong> As has been seen,
	the perfect system consists of the Perfect tense and the Perfect
	Participle. The participle will be treated of in the chapter on
	Participles.</font></p>

	<p><font><strong>428.</strong> The Perfect is
	characterised by the reduplication of the root. The rules have
	already been given (372) and should now be read over carefully.</font></p>

	<p><font><strong>429.</strong> The endings are:</font></p>

	<p><font>Perfect.<br>
	Active. Reflective.<br>
	Sing. Plur. Sing. Plur.<br>
	1. a mha i mhe<br>
	2. e ttha ttho vho<br>
	3. a u ttha re</font></p>

	<p><font>Remarks.<br>
	(a) Roots ending in a consonant insert an before the above
	endings beginning with a consonant.<br>
	(b) The Perfect is of very rare occurence.</font></p>

	<p><font color="#0000FF" size="4"><strong>The
	Future System</strong></font></p>

	<p><font><strong>431.</strong> This system
	includes the Future, the Conditional and the Future Participle.
	The Participle will be considered in a special chapter.</font></p>

	<p><font><strong>432.</strong> The Future System
	has for special characteristic the sign: ssa inserted between the
	root and the personal endings.</font></p>

	<p><font>Remarks.<br>
	(a) The Future System is frequently formed on the Present base.<br>
	(b) The vowel i is often inserted between the ssa and the root or
	base; in this case the final vowel of the root or base is
	dropped.<br>
	(c) When the ssa is added directly to a root ending in a
	consonant, the same changes which occur in the Aorist occur also
	in the Future System, through the assimilation of the initial s
	of ssa.</font></p>

	<p><font><strong>433.</strong> The Personal
	Endings for the Future are:<br>
	Active. Reflective.<br>

	<p><font>Remarks.<br>
	(a) It will be seen that in the active the endings are the same
	as those of the present indicative. (381)<br>

	bhokkhati. bhokkhate, bhokkha</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font>, etc.</font></p>

	<p><font>&#8730;chid. to cut, gives: checcha (Sansk.
	&#8730;chid=chet+·ya=cet·ya) then:<br>
	checch&#257;mi, checchasi, checchati etc.</font></p>

	<p><font>&#8730;dis, to see, gives a future: dakkha;
	(=Sans.&#8730;d¨c=drak+·ya=drak·ya) from this we find - dakkhati,
	but more frequently dakkhiti. Similarly from the root &#8730;sak to be
	able, is obtained sakkhiti.</font></p>

	<p><font><strong>435.</strong> A double future is
	also found formed from bases like bhokkha, dakka, which, as has

	(ii) When the root ends in a consonant, ta may be joined to it by
	means of connecting vowel i.<br>
	(iii) When the root ends in a consonant, ta may become
	assimilated to it according to the usual rules.<br>
	Remarks. At this stage the student ought to read carefully the
	chapter on Asssmilation (51.)</font></p>

	Participle</strong></font></p>

	<p><font><strong>466.</strong> This participle,
	also called participle of necessity, potential participle and
	gerundive, is formed by adding to the root the suffixes: tabba,
	ya, an&#299;ya and &#299;ya.<br>
	Remarks.<br>
	(a) Roots ending in u, &#363;, generally form the Future P. P. from
	the special base.<br>
	(b) This participle is passive in sense, expresses suitability,
	fitness, propriety and may be translated by &quot;fit to
	be...&quot; &#7747;ust be...&quot; &quot;ought to be...&quot;&quot;to
	be...&quot; that which is expressed by the root.<br>
	(c) These participles, like those already treated of, are

	<p><font color="#0000FF"><strong>Tabba</strong></font></p>

	<p><font><strong>467.</strong> This suffix is the

	(i) Directly to roots ending in a vowel.<br>
	(ii) To roots ending in a consonant, it may be joined by means of
	connecting vowel i.<br>
	(iii) When added directly without connecting vowel i to roots
	ending in a consonant, initial t of tabba is assimilated to or
	assimilates the last consonant of the root in exactly the same
	manner as in the formation of the Passive Perfect Participle.</font></p>

	<p><font color="#FF0000"><strong>The Gerund</strong></font></p>

	<p><font><strong>470.</strong> The gerund is
	formed by means of suffixes: tv&#257;, tv&#257;na, t&#363;na, ya, and
	tya. It is indeclinable and partakes of the nature of a
	participle.</font></p>

	<p><font>Remarks.<br>
	(a) The suffix tv&#257; is most commonly met with; tv&#257;na,
	t&#363;na, and sometimes t&#363;na</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> are used as substitutes of tv&#257; and are met
	with in poetry much more than in prose.<br>
	(b) ya is not so restricted in use as tv&#257;na and t&#363;na.<br>
	(c) tya which becomes regularly cca (74, iv), is merely a form of
	ya, initial t being inserted between the gerundian, suffix ya and
	a root ending in a vowel.<br>
	(e.g. pa+&#8730;i, to depart+ya=pa+i+t+ya=petya=pecca having departed,
	110).<br>
	In P&#257;li ya is added indiscriminately to simple roots or to
	roots compounded with prefixes; but, as in Sansk. (in which it is
	never used after simple roots), it is much more common after
	compound verbs.</font></p>

	<p><font color="#0000FF"><strong>Tv&#257;,

	(i) Joined to the root by means of connecting vowel i.<br>
	(ii) The initial t of the suffix is, in a few cases assimilated
	to the last consonant of the root.<br>
	(iii) The vowel of the root is gu&#7751;ated<br>
	(iv) Sometimes the last consonant of the root is dropped before
	suffixes tv&#257;, tv&#257;na and t&#363;na<br>
	(v) The final long vowel of a root is shortened before these
	suffixes.<br>
	(vi) The suffixes are added to the special base as well as to the
	root.</font></p>

	This last should not be confounded with gerund, from &#8730;han, given

	<p><font>Remarks.<br>
	(a) Sometimes the gerund having been formed by means of ya, the

	of ya and tv&#257;, and joined to<br>
	the root by means of i, as:<br>
	&#257;ruyhitv&#257; (&#8730;ruh), having ascended.<br>

	da&#7789;&#7789;hu=disv&#257;.<br>
	anuvicca, from &#8730;vid, to know=having known, final d being dropped

	vineyya. from &#8730;n&#299;, having removed.<br>
	niccheyya, from &#8730;ni=having ascertained.<br>
	In these last three examples the y has undergone reduplication.<br>
	atisitv&#257;, from &#8730;sar=Sanskrit s¨.(?), having approached,
	having excelled.<br>
	(d) The student will have remarked that several forms are met

	Derivative or secondary Conjugation</strong></font></p>

	<p><font><strong>478.</strong> The Derivative
	Conjugation includes:<br>
	(1) the Passive;<br>
	(2) the Causative;<br>
	(3) the Denominative;<br>
	(4) the Desiderative and,<br>
	(5) the Intensive.</font></p>

	<p><font><strong>479.</strong> It is called the
	derivative conjugation because the above named five kinds of
	verbs are derived from the simple root with a well-defined
	modification of the sense of the root itself.</font></p>

	<p><font><strong>480.</strong> Except for the
	Causative, Derivative verbs are not conjugated in all the tenses
	and in all voices.</font></p>

	<p><font>(I) </font><font color="#FF0000"><strong>The Passive</strong></font></p>

	<p><font><strong>481.</strong> The Passive
	Conjugation is formed by adding the suffix ya to the root.</font></p>

	<p><font><strong>482.</strong> The suffix ya
	having been added and the Passive Base obtained, the Personal
	Endings of either the Active Voice or of the Reflective Voice are
	added to the base.</font></p>

	<p><font><strong>483.</strong> Ya is affixed to
	the root in three ways:<br>
	(i) Directly after roots ending in a vowel.<br>
	(ii) To roots in a double consonant, ya is joined by means of i,
	this i being lengthened to &#299;. It is also joined by means of i
	when a root ends in a consonant that does not generally
	reduplicate (s, h and r).<br>
	(iii) It may be added directly to roots ending in a consonant; in
	this case the y of ya becomes assimilated to the last consonant
	of the root according to the Rules of Assimilation. (70.)<br>
	(iv) Ya is also added to the Special Base by means of i,
	lengthened.</font></p>

	<p><font color="#0000FF"><u>Examples</u></font><font> of (i).<br>
	Remarks.<br>
	(a) When ya is added to roots ending in a vowel, the vowel of the
	root undergoes some change, especially vowels: a, i and u.<br>
	(b) Radical &#257; is changed to &#299; before ya and radical i, u,
	are lengthened to &#299;, &#363;.<br>

	&#8730;ku to sing, k&#363;ya, to be sung.<br>
	&#8730;su, to hear, s&#363;ya, to be heard.<br>
	(c) Radical long &#299; and &#363;, remain unaffected:<br>
	&#8730;bh&#363;, to become, bh&#363;ya, to have become.<br>
	&#8730;l&#363; to reap, l&#363;ya, to be reaped.<br>
	&#8730;n&#299;, to lead, n&#299;ya, to be led.<br>
	(d) In some instances, the long vowel before ya is shortened, in
	which case the y is doubled.<br>

	<p><font><strong>484.</strong> To the above bases
	the Active or Reflective Personal Endings being added, we obtain,

	<p><font><strong>485.</strong> Long &#299;, before ya
	of the Passive, is sometimes found shortened, as: mah&#299;yati or
	mahiyati, to be honoured.</font></p>

	<p><font><strong>486.</strong> It is usual to
	form the Passive of roots ending in a consonant preceded by long
	&#257;, by means<br>
	of &#299;:<br>
	&#8730;yac, to beg=y&#257;c&#299;yati;<br>
	&#8730;aj, to drive+prefix pa=p&#257;j, to drive=p&#257;j&#299;yati, to be
	driven.</font></p>

	<p><font><strong>487.</strong> Ya may be added
	directly after some roots ending a consonant without assimilation
	taking place and without the insertion of connecting vowel &#299;;
	as:<br>
	&#8730;lup, to cut, elide=lupya+ti=lupyati, to be elided, cut off.<br>
	&#8730;gam, to go=gamya+ti=gamyati, to be gone to.</font></p>

	<p><font>Remarks.<br>
	(a) We have already said that when the &#299; before ya is shortened,
	initial y is reduplicated by way of compensation (483, d).<br>
	(b) The Perfect, thc Aorist, the Future and the Conditional
	(which four tenses are called: General Tenses; see, 367), of the
	Reflective Voice, are often used in a passive sense.</font></p>

	<p><font><strong>488.</strong> The Passive may
	assume several forms from the same root:<br>
	&#8730;kar, to do, make, gives Passive: kar&#299;yati, kariyyati, kayirati
	(with metathesis), kayyati (with asssimilation of r, 80).<br>
	&#8730;gam, to go, gives; gam&#299;yati, gacch&#299;yati, gamyati.<br>
	&#8730;gah, to take, gives: gayhati (metathesis); gheppati, quite an
	anomalous form.<br>
	&#8730;h&#257;, to abandon: h&#257;yati, hiyati.</font></p>

	<p><font><strong>489.</strong> Anomalous form of
	the Passive.<br>
	&#8730;vah, to carry, Passive Base=vuyh: vuyh&#257;mi, vuyhasi,
	vuyhati, vuyhe, vuyhase, vuyhate, etc.<br>
	&#8730;vas, to live, Passive Base=vuss: vuss&#257;mi, vussasi,

	etc.<br>
	&#8730;vac, to speak, Passive Base=vucc :vucc&#257;mi, vuccasi vuccati
	etc.</font></p>

	<p><font><strong>490.</strong> Final s of a root,
	which is not usually susceptible of reduplication is, however,
	sometimes found reduplicated as:<br>
	&#8730;dis, to see, becomes, dissati, to be seen.<br>
	&#8730;nas, to destroy=nassati, to be destroyed.</font></p>

	<p><font color="#FF0000"><strong>Causative Verbs</strong></font></p>

	<p><font><strong>491.</strong> Causal or
	Causative verbs are formed by adding to the root the suffixes:<br>
	(i) aya, which is often contracted to e.<br>
	(ii) &#257;paya, which likewise may be contracted to &#257;pe.</font></p>

	<p><font><strong>492.</strong> (i) The radical
	vowel of the root is gu&#7751;ated or strengthened before these
	suffixes, if followed by one consonant only.<br>
	(ii) It remains unchanged when it is followed by two consonants.<br>
	(iii) In some cases, radical a is not lengthened although
	followed by a single consonant.<br>
	(iv) Roots in i, &#299; and u, &#363; form their causal from the Special
	Base.<br>
	(v) Other verbs, too, may form the causal from the Special Base.<br>
	(vi) Some roots in a take &#257;pe, &#257;paya.</font></p>

	<p><font color="#0000FF"><strong>Causal Passive</strong></font></p>

	<p><font><strong>495.</strong> The passive of a
	causal verb is formed by joining the suffix ya of the Passive to
	the Causative Base, by means of i, lengthened to &#299;, final vowel
	e of the Causative base having been dropped first. The Causal
	Passive may be translated by &quot;caused to... , made to

	<p><font>Remarks.<br>
	(a) Suffixes &#257;ra and &#257;la are simply modifications of
	aya.<br>
	(b) There is an uncommon way of forming Denominative Verbs from
	nouns: the 1st, 2nd or 3rd syllable of the noun is reduplicated
	and the suffix &#299;yisa or yisa added to the word thus
	reduplicated; the vowel u or i may or may not be inserted between
	the reduplication. (Niruttid&#299;pan&#299;).<br>
	Noun Stem. Denominative Verb.<br>

	flower.<br>
	(c) The Causal and Passive of all Denominatives are formed in the
	usual manner.</font></p>

	<p><font color="#FF0000"><strong>Desiderative
	Verbs</strong></font></p>

	<p><font><strong>503.</strong> As its very name
	indicates, the Desiderative Conjugation expresses the wish or
	desire to do or be that which is denoted by the simple root.</font></p>

	<p><font><strong>504.</strong> The Desiderative
	is not extensively used in P&#257;li; however, it is frequent
	enough to warrant a careful perusal of the rules for its
	formation.</font></p>

	<p><font><strong>505.</strong> The suffix sa is
	the characteristic sign of this conjugation; another
	characteristic is the reduplication of the root according to the
	rules already given (372). The student ought first to look
	carefully over those rules.<br>
	Root. Desiderative Base. Desiderative Verb.<br>
	&#8730;su, to hear, sussusa sussusati, to desire to hear=listens.
	(33,372-7c).<br>
	&#8730;bhuj, to eat bubhukkha, bubhukkhati, to wish to eat. (86,
	372-5).<br>
	&#8730;tij, to bear, titikkha, titikkhati, to endure, be patient. (86,
	372-7b).<br>
	&#8730;ghas, to eat, jighaccha, jighacchati, to desire to eat. (89,
	372-7a).<br>
	&#8730;p&#257;, to drink, pip&#257;sa, piv&#257;sa piv&#257;sati, to
	desire to drink. (372-7a).<br>
	(piv&#257;sa, from the root).<br>
	&#8730;kit, to cure, cikiccha, cikicchati, to desire to cure, to
	treat. (88; 372-2).</font></p>

	<p><font><strong>506.</strong> It will be
	remarked that the initial s of sa is mostly assimilated.</font></p>

	<p><font><strong>507.</strong> The bases being
	obtained, the personal endings are added as usual.<br>
	Remark. The Causal and Passive are formed in the usual way.</font></p>

	<p><font color="#FF0000"><strong>Intensive Verbs</strong></font></p>

	<p><font><strong>508.</strong> The Intensive
	Verbs also called Frequentative Verbs, express the frequent
	repetition or the intensification of the action denoted by the
	simple root. The characteristic of the Intensive Conjugation is
	the reduplication of the root according to the usual rules (372).</font></p>

	<p><font><strong>509.</strong> These verbs are
	not very frequent in P&#257;li.<br>
	</font><font color="#0000FF"><u>Examples</u></font><font><br>
	Root. Intensive Verb.<br>
	&#8730;lap, to talk. l&#257;lappati, l&#257;lapati, to lament.<br>

	<p><font color="#0000FF" size="4"><strong>Verbal
	Prefixes</strong></font></p>

	<p><font><strong>514.</strong> The Prefixes or
	Prepositions, called in P&#257;li: Upasagga (23, Remark), are
	prefixed to verbs and their derivatives; they have been, on that
	account, called Verbal Prefixes. They generally modify the
	meaning of the root, or intensify it, and sometimes totally alter
	it; in many cases, they add but little to the original sense of
	the root.</font></p>

	<p><font><strong>515.</strong> The usual rules of
	sandhi apply when these prefixes are placed before verbs. When a
	prefix is placed before a tense with the augment a, the augment
	must not change its position, but remain between the prefix and
	the root, as; ag&#257;+ati=accag&#257; (74, i), and not;
	&#257;tig&#257;</font></p>

	<p><font><strong>516.</strong> These prefixes are
	as follows:<br>
	&#257; - to, at, towards, near to, until, as far as, away, all
	round.<br>
	</font><font color="#0000FF"><u>Examples<br>

	&#8730;chad, to cover=acch&#257;deti, to cover over or all around, to
	put on clothes (33, 35).<br>
	Remarks. This prefix reverses the meaning of some roots;<br>
	&#8730;d&#257;, to give, but &#257;d&#257;ti, to take.<br>

	Remarks. It should be borne in mind that two, and sometimes
	three, of the above prefixes may combine. The most common

	ajjh&#257;seti, to lie upon (&#8730;s&#299;).<br>
	anupa (=anu+pa), anupakh&#257;dati, to eat into (khad);
	anupabbajati to give up the world (&#8730;vaj, to go).<br>
	anupari (=anu+pari), anuparidh&#257;vati, to run up and down

	Remark. The student must be prepared to meet with some other
	combinations; the general meaning of a word can always be traced
	from the sense of the several combined prefixes.</font></p>

	<p><font><strong>517.</strong> It is important to
	note that the prefixes or prepositions are used, not only with
	verbs, but also with verbal derivatives, nouns and adjectives,
	as: anut&#299;re, along the bank; adhicitta</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font>, high thought;
	abhin&#299;lo, very black.</font></p>

	<p><font><strong>518.</strong> pari is often
	written: pali (72).</font></p>

	<p><font><strong>519.</strong> pari, vi and sam
	very often add merely an intensive force to the root.</font></p>

	<p><font><strong>520.</strong> After prefixes,
	sam upa, par&#257;, pari, and the word pura, in front, &#8730;kar
	sometimes assumes the form: khar. E.g. purakkharoti, to put in
	front, to follow=pura+&#8730;kar: parikkharo,<br>
	surrounding=pari+&#8730;kar.</font></p>

	<p><font><strong>521.</strong> A few adverbs are
	used very much in the same way as the Verbal Prefixes, but their
	use is restricted to a few verbs only. They are:</font></p>

	<p><font>&#257;vi=in full view, in sight, in
	view, manifestly, visibly. It is prefixed to the verbs: bhavati
	(&#8730;bh&#363;) and karoti (&#8730;kar).<br>
	</font><font color="#0000FF"><u>Examples<br>
	</u></font><font>&#257;vibhavati to become
	manifest, visible, to appear, be evident; &#257;vikaroti, to make
	manifest, clear, evident; to explain, show.</font></p>

	<p><font>antara=among within, between, used with
	&#8730;dh&#257;, to put, place; e.g. antaradh&#257;yati, to vanish,
	disappear, hide; antaradh&#257;peti, to cause to vanish or
	disappear.</font></p>

	<p><font>attha</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> (adv. and
	noun)=home; disappearance, disappearing, setting; used with verbs
	of going=to set, disappear (of moon, sun and stars). Mostly used
	with the verbs gacchati and eti (&#8730;i), to go.<br>
	</font><font color="#0000FF"><u>Examples<br>
	</u></font><font>attha&#7749;gacchati, to disappear,
	to set; atthameti, to set (of the sun).</font></p>

	<p><font>p&#257;tu (before a vowel: patur)=forth
	to view, manifestly, evidently, used with bhavati and karoti.<br>
	</font><font color="#0000FF"><u>Examples<br>
	</u></font><font>p&#257;tubhavati, to become
	manifest, evident, clear, to appear, to arise;
	p&#257;tubh&#257;vo, appearance, manifestation; p&#257;tukaroti,
	to manifest, make clear, evident; to produce.</font></p>

	<p><font>pura, in front, forward, before, used
	almost exclusively with karoti, (520).<br>
	</font><font color="#0000FF"><u>Examples<br>
	</u></font><font>purakkharoti, to put or place in
	front, to appoint or make a person (one's) leader, and thence: to
	follow, to revere.</font></p>

	<p><font>ala</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font>, fit, fit for, used with verb karoti in the
	sense of decorating. E.g. ala&#7749;karoti, to adorn, embellish,
	decorate.</font></p>

	<p><font>tiro, out of sight; across, beyond,
	prefixed to roots kar and dh&#257;, in the sense of covering,
	hiding, etc.<br>
	</font><font color="#0000FF"><u>Examples<br>
	</u></font><font>tirodh&#257;peti, to veil, to
	cover, put out of sight; tirodh&#257;na</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font>, a covering, a
	veil; tirokaroti, to veil, to screen; tirokara&#7751;i, a screen, a
	veil.</font></p>

	<p><font><strong>522.</strong> Prefixes du and su
	are never used with verbs. (See Chapter on Adverbs), and prefix a
	(an), is very seldom so used.</font></p>

	<p><font><strong>523.</strong> To finish this
	chapter on Verbs, we will now give the paradigm of a verb fully
	conjugated:</font></p>

	Practical Grammar of the P&#257;li Language<br>
	Chapter 11</strong></font></p>

	<p><font color="#FF0000" size="4"><strong>Indeclinables</strong></font></p>

	<p><font><strong>529.</strong> Under the term
	&quot;indeclinables&quot; are included all those words which are
	incapable of any grammatical declension, that is: Adverbs,
	Prefixes, Propositions, Conjunctions and Interjections.</font></p>

	<p><font color="#0000FF" size="4"><strong>Adverbs</strong></font></p>

	<p><font><strong>530.</strong> Adverbs may be
	divided into three groups:<br>
	(i) Derivative Adverbs, formed by means of suffixes.<br>
	(ii) Case-form Adverbs.<br>
	(iii) Pure Adverbs.</font></p>

	<p><font><strong>531.</strong> (i) </font><font
	color="#FF0000"><strong>Derivative Adverbs</strong></font></p>

	<p><font>(a) These are formed by the addition to
	pronominal stems, and to the stems of nouns and adjectives, of
	certain suffixes.</font></p>

	<p><font>(b) Under this head come the
	&quot;Adverbial Derivatives from numerals&quot; given in (279),
	and the &quot;Pronominal Derivatives&quot; given in (336). The
	student ought now to read again these two classes of Adverbs.</font></p>

	<p><font>(c) The suffix to (346), is also added
	to prepositions, nouns and adjectives, to form a very large class
	of adverbs; to is an ablative suffix (120) and therefore the
	adverbs formed with it have an ablative sense.<br>
	(i) From prepositions: abhito, near; parato, further.<br>
	(ii) From nouns:<br>
	dakkhi&#7751;ato, southerly, on the south;<br>
	p&#257;c&#299;nato, easterly, on the east;<br>
	pi&#7789;&#7789;hito, from the surface, from the back, etc.,<br>
	p&#257;rato, from the further shore;<br>
	orato, from the near shore.<br>
	(iii) From adjectives; sabbato, everywhere.</font></p>

	<p><font>(d) Suffixes tra and tha (346), showing
	place, are also used with adjectives: a&#241;&#241;atha or
	a&#241;&#241;atra, elsewhere; sabbatha, everywhere; ubhayattha,
	in both places.</font></p>

	<p><font>(e) Suffix d&#257; (345), is likewise
	used with adjectives and numerals: ekad&#257;, once;
	sad&#257;=sabbad&#257;, at all times, always.</font></p>

	<p><font>(f) dhi is used like dh&#257; (28, 283):
	sabbadhi, everywhere.</font></p>

	<p><font>(g) Suffixes so and s&#257; (122, c, d)
	likewise form adverbs: bahuso, in a great degree; atthaso,
	according to the sense; balas&#257;, forcibly.</font></p>

	<p><font>(h) iti, (347) is extensively used as
	the particle of quotation; it is often abbreviated to ti (See
	Syntax).</font></p>

	<p><font><strong>532.</strong> (ii) </font><font
	color="#FF0000"><strong>Case-form Adverbs</strong></font></p>

	<p><font>(a) Some cases of pronouns, and
	adjectives, are used adverbially.</font></p>

	<p><font>(b) Accusative Case. This case is very
	much used adverbially: ki</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font>, why?; ta</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> there; ida</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> here; ya</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> because, since; from pronouns.</font></p>

	<p><font>(c) From nouns; divasa</font><font
	size="3">&#7747;</font><font> during
	the day; ratti</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> at night; raho, in secret; sacca</font><font
	size="3">&#7747;</font><font> truly;
	attha</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> for the purpose of.</font></p>

	<p><font>(d) For adjectives: cira</font><font
	size="3">&#7747;</font><font>, a long
	time; khippa</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font>, quickly; manda</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font>, stupidly.</font></p>

	<p><font>(e) Some adverbs of obscure origin may
	be classed as the accusative case of nouns or adjectives long
	obsolete. Such are: mitho, mithu, one another, mutually; ara</font><font
	size="3">&#7747;</font><font>,
	presently; sajju, immediately; tu&#7751;h&#299;, silently; ala</font><font
	size="3">&#7747;</font><font>, enough,
	s&#257;ya</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font>, in the evening; isa</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> a little,
	somewhat; j&#257;tu, surely, certainly; bahi, outside.<br>
	The Instrumentive. This case also is much used adverbially.<br>
	From pronouns: tena, therefore; yena; because.<br>
	From nouns: divasena, in a day; m&#257;sena, in a month;
	div&#257; by day; sah&#257;s&#257;, suddenly.<br>
	From adjectives: cirena, long; dakkhi&#7751;ena, to the south;
	uttarena, to the north; antarena, within.<br>
	The Dative Case: the adverbial use of the dative is restricted to
	atth&#257;ya, for the sake of, for the purpose of; cir&#257;ya,
	for a long time; hit&#257;ya, for the benefit of.<br>
	The Ablative Case, is used frequently in an adverbial sense;
	especially so is the case with pronouns: kasm&#257;, why?;
	yasm&#257;, because; tasm&#257;, therefore; pacch&#257;, behind;
	after; &#257;r&#257;, afar off; he&#7789;&#7789;h&#257;, below.<br>
	The Genitive Case is seldom used adverbially; from pronouns we
	have: kissa why?<br>
	From adjectives: cirassa, long; from nouns: hetussa, causally.<br>
	The Locative is very often used adverbially: b&#257;hire,
	outside; d&#363;re, far, avid&#363;re, not far; sam&#299;pe, santike, near;
	rahasi, privately, in secret; bhuvi, on earth, on the earth.</font></p>

	<p><font>(iii) </font><font color="#FF0000"><strong>Pure Adverbs</strong></font></p>

	<p><font>By these are understood the adverbs
	which are not obtained by derivation and which are not
	case-forms; such are:<br>
	kira, kila, they say, we are told that; hi, certainly, indeed;
	khalu, indeed; tu, now, indeed; atha, atho, and, also, then; etc.<br>
	na, expressing simple negation; m&#257;, expressing prohibition;
	m&#257; is often used with the Aorist.<br>
	nanu, used in asking questions to which an affirmative answer is
	expected. nu used in asking simple questions; no, not; n&#363;na
	surely, perhaps; n&#257;n&#257;, variously.<br>
	The particle kva, where?<br>
	The above particles are called nip&#257;t&#257; by the
	grammarians, they number about two hundred.</font></p>

	<p><font color="#FF0000"><strong>Verbal Prefixes</strong></font><font>; have already been treated of (514).</font></p>

	<p><font color="#FF0000"><strong>Inseparable
	Prefixes</strong></font></p>

	<p><font>(a) a, and before a vowel an, not,
	without, free from.<br>
	e.g. abhaya, free from fear; ab&#257;la, not foolish; apassanto,
	not seeing; an&#257;loketva, without looking.</font></p>

	<p><font>(b) du and before a vowel dur, bad, ill,
	hard difficult.<br>
	e.g. dubba&#7751;&#7751;o (33. Remark), ugly, ill-favoured; dubbin&#299;to ill
	conducted; duddamo, difficult to tame; duggo, difficult to pass;
	dujjano, a bad man; dukkaro, difficult to perform; dujj&#299;va</font><font
	size="3">&#7747;</font><font>, a hard
	life.</font></p>

	<p><font>(c) su has the contrary meaning of du
	:good, well, easy. It implies excess, facility, excellence.<br>
	e.g. subh&#257;sito, well-spoken; subahu, very much; sudanto,
	well-tamed; sukaro, easy to perform; sulabho, easy to be
	obtained.<br>
	Remarks. After du, the initial consonant is generally
	reduplicated; reduplication seldom takes place after su.</font></p>

	<p><font>(d) sa, which is used instead of sam,
	(516), expresses the ideas of &quot;possession, similarity; with,
	and; like; including.&quot;<br>
	e.g. sabh&#257;riya, with (his) wife; salajja, having shame,
	ashamed; sabhoga, wealthy; savih&#257;r&#299;, living with: sadevaka,
	including the worlds of gods.<br>
	Remarks. The particle sa is the opposite of particle a, an.</font></p>

	<p><font color="#0000FF" size="4"><strong>Prepositions</strong></font></p>

	<p><font><strong>533.</strong> It has been seen
	that Verbal prefixes are properly prepositions and are used with
	nouns as well as verbs.</font></p>

	<p><font><strong>534.</strong> Many adverbs are
	used with a prepositional force along with nouns. Those of class
	(ii) Case form adverbs, are seldom used as prepositions, except
	perhaps those in to.</font></p>

	<p><font><strong>535.</strong> Prepositions, or
	words used prepositionally may govern any case, except the
	Nominative and Vocative.</font></p>

	<p><font><strong>536.</strong> Most of the Verbal
	Prefixes require the noun to be in one case or other.</font></p>

	<p><font><strong>537.</strong> The cases mostly
	used with prepositions or prepositional Adverbs are: the
	genitive, the instrumentive and the accusative.<br>
	But only a few are used separately from the noun they govern.<br>
	For examples see &quot;Syntax of Substantives.&quot;</font></p>

	<p><font color="#0000FF" size="4"><strong>Conjunctions</strong></font></p>

	<p><font><strong>538.</strong> Indeclinables
	distinctly conjunctive are very few. The principal are:</font></p>

	<p><font>(a) Copulative: ca, and, also, but,
	even. It is never used as the first word in a sentence; atha,
	and, then, now; atho; and also then.</font></p>

	<p><font>(b) Disjunctive: v&#257;, (never at the
	start of a sentence) uda, uda v&#257;, or v&#257; ... v&#257;,
	either or; yadi v&#257;, whether; yadi v&#257; ... yadi v&#257;,
	whether or; atha v&#257;, or else, rather; na v&#257;, or not;
	tath&#257; pi, nevertheless.</font></p>

	<p><font>(c) Conditional: yadi sace, if; ce
	(never at the beginning of a sentence) if; yadi eva</font><font
	size="3">&#7747;</font><font>,
	yajj'eva</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font>, if so.</font></p>

	<p><font>(d) Causal: hi, for, because; certainly.</font></p>

	<p><font color="#0000FF" size="4"><strong>Interjections</strong></font></p>

	<p><font>Ahaha, alas! oh! aho! ah!; aho vata, oh!
	ah!; are, sirrah! I say! here!; dhi, dh&#299;, shame! fie! woe!; bho,
	friend! sir! I say!; bha&#7751;e, I say! to be sure!; ma&#241;&#241;e,
	why! methinks!; he, oh!; s&#257;dhu, well! very well! very good!</font></p>

	<p><font>General Remarks. The use of some
	particles will be given in the chapter on Syntax.</font></p>

	<hr /><p id="ch12" align="center"><font size="4"><strong>A
	Practical Grammar of the P&#257;li Language<br>
	Chapter 12</strong></font></p>

	<p><font color="#FF0000" size="4"><strong>Compounds</strong></font></p>

	<p><font><strong>539.</strong> Declinable stems
	are frequently joined to one another to form compounds. In the
	older language, compounds are simple and rarely consist of more
	than 2 or 3 stems, but the later the language (i.e. in the
	commentaries and sub-commentaries) the more involved they become.</font></p>

	<p><font><strong>540.</strong> Compounds may also
	have an indeclinable as the first member; there are even a few
	compounds made up entirely of indeclinables.</font></p>

	<p><font>Remarks. The Case Endings of the first
	member or members of a compound are generally dropped; only in a
	few instances are they preserved.</font></p>

	<p><font><strong>541.</strong> There are six
	kinds of Compound Words:<br>
	(i) dvanda, Copulative or Aggregative Compounds.<br>
	(ii) tappurisa, Dependent Determinate Compounds.<br>
	(iii) kammadh</font><font size="3">&#257;</font><font>raya, Descriptive Determinate Compounds.<br>
	(iv) digu, Numeral Determinate Compounds.<br>
	(v) abyayibh</font><font size="3">&#257;</font><font>va, Adverbial Compounds.<br>
	(vi) bahubbihi, Relative Or Attributive Compounds.</font></p>

	<p><font>Remarks. Native grammarians distribute
	the above into four classes by making. Nos. iii and iv
	subdivisions of No. ii, tappurisa; but this classification,
	through lack of sufficient distinctness, confuses the student
	unnecessarily. We shall therefore follow the above division
	(541).</font></p>

	<p><font color="#0000FF" size="4"><strong>Dvanda
	(Copulative or Aggregative Compounds)</strong></font></p>

	<p><font><strong>542.</strong> The members of
	these compounds are co-ordinate syntatically, in their
	uncompounded state; each member would be connected with the other
	by means of the conjunction ca, and</font></p>

	<p><font><strong>543.</strong> Dvanda Compounds
	are of two kinds:<br>
	(i) The compound is a plural and takes the gender and declension
	of its last member.<br>
	(ii) The compound takes the form of a neuter singular and,
	whatever the number of its members, becomes a collective. This is
	the case generally with the names of: birds, parts of the body,
	persons of different sexes, countries, trees herbs, the cardinal
	points, domestic animals, things that form an antithesis, etc.</font></p>

	<p><font>Remarks. The following rules are given
	as to the order of the members of dvanda compounds:<br>
	(a) words in i and u are placed first;<br>
	(b) shorter words are placed before longer ones;<br>
	(c) </font><font size="3">&#299;</font><font> and &#363; (long), are generally shortened in the
	middle of the compound;<br>
	(d) sometimes a feminine noun, in the middle of the compound,
	takes the masculine form (candimasuriy</font><font size="3">&#257;</font><font>) sometimes,
	or remains unchanged (jar</font><font size="3">&#257;</font><font>mara</font><font size="3">&#7751;</font><font>a</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font>).</font></p>

	<p><font><strong>544.</strong> The compounds
	which take the plural form are called: itaritara, because the
	members of the compound are considered separately; those that
	take the neuter singular form: sam&#257;h&#257;ra, because the
	several members are considered collectively, those that take
	either the plural or the neuter, are called:
	vikappasam&#257;h&#257;ra.</font></p>

	<p><font>Remarks.<br>
	(a) In kammadh&#257;raya compounds, the adjective: mahanta
	assumes the form: mah&#257;, and, if the consonant which follows
	is reduplicated, the form: maha.<br>
	(b)The word: santa, good, being, takes the form; sa (Sansk. sat).<br>
	(c) The word: puma, a male, rejects its final a.<br>
	(d) When the two members of a kammadh&#257;raya are feminine, the
	first one assumes the form of the masculine.<br>
	(e) The Prefix na, not, is replaced by a before a consonant and
	by an before a vowel.<br>
	(f) Prefix ku, meaning bad, little, may become ka before a
	consonant, and kad before a vowel.<br>
	(g) In their uncompounded state, the two members of a
	kammadh&#257;raya are in the same case.<br>
	(i) The kammadharaya compound (which is also called:
	missakatappurisa) is divided into nine classes:</font></p>

	color="#0000FF" size="4"><strong>Bahubb&#299;hi
	(Relative or Attributive Compounds)</strong></font></p>

	<p><font>Remarks.<br>
	(a) A bahubbihi compound, when resolved into its component parts,
	requires the addition of such relative pronouns as: &quot;he,
	who, that, which,&quot; etc., to express its full meaning; a
	bahubbihi is therefore used relatively, that is, as an adjective,
	and consequently, the final member assumes the forms of the three
	genders, according to the gender of the noun which it qualifies.
	A bahubbihi is equal to a relative clause.<br>
	(b) All the Compounds explained above (dvanda, tappurisa,
	kammadh&#257;raya, d&#299;gu, abyayibh&#257;va), become, if used as
	adjectives, bahubbihi Compounds.<br>
	(c) babubbihi being used as adjectives qualifying nouns, must
	agree in gender, number and case with the nouns which they
	qualify.<br>
	(d) It follows from (c) that a bahubbihi may be in any case
	relation but the Vocative.</font></p>

	<p><font>The following are the different kinds of

	<p><font>(7) sattama-bahubb&#299;hi, Relative in the
	Locative Case; that is, in which the bahubbihi gives to the

	vijitam&#257;ro (3)=he who has conquered Mara, the Buddha.</font></p>

	<p><font>(f) In some bahubbihi, the determining

	<p><font>(g) Feminine nouns ending in &#299;, &#363; as
	well as stems ending in tu (=t&#257;, see, 163, words declined
	like satth&#257;,) generally take the suffix ka, when they are
	the last member of a bahubbihi; possession is then implied:<br>
	</font><font color="#0000FF"><u>Examples<br>
	</u></font><font>bahukattuko deso=a place in

	bahunadiko janapado=a district with many rivers.<br>
	Note that long &#299; is shortened before ka; the same remark applies
	to long &#363;.</font></p>

	<p><font>(h) When a feminine noun is the last
	member of a babubbihi, it takes the masculine form if determining
	a masculine noun, and the first member, if also feminine, drops
	the sign of the feminine:<br>

	d&#299;ghaja&#7749;gho puriso a long-legged man.</font></p>

	<p><font>(i) The adjective mah&#257;, may be used

	</font><font color="#0000FF"><u>Example</u></font><font> mah&#257;pa&#241;&#241;o, of great wisdom, very
	wise.</font></p>

	<p><font>(j) Sometimes &#257; is added,to the

	<p><font>Upapada Compounds</font></p>

	<p><font><strong>552.</strong> When the second
	member of a dutiy&#257; tappurisa Compound is a kita noun or
	Primary derivative, (see Chapter XIII, Primary and Secondary
	Derivation), and the first member a noun in the Accusative
	relation, the compound is called upapada. Such a compound may
	therefore be called indifferently: upapada or upapadatappurisa.
	or simply: tappurisa. (niruttid&#299;pan&#299;)</font></p>

	<p><font>Anomalous Compounds</font></p>

	<p><font><strong>553.</strong> A few compounds
	are found which are quite anomalous in their formation, that is,
	they are made up of words not usually compounded together. These
	compounds must probably be considered as of very early formation,
	and be reckoned amongst the oldest in the language. We give a few
	examples:</font></p>

	<p><font color="#0000FF"><u>Examples<br>
	</u></font><font>vitatho=vi+tath&#257;, false,
	unreal.<br>
	yath&#257;tatho=yath&#257;+tath&#257; real, true, as it really
	is.<br>
	itih&#257; (=iti, thus+ha, lengthened to &#257;), thus indeed,
	introduction, legend.<br>
	itih&#257;sa (=iti, thus+ha, indeed+&#257;sa, was), thus indeed
	it was=itih&#257;.<br>
	itih&#299;tih&#257; (=itiha+itih&#257; )=itih&#257;, itih&#257;sa.<br>
	itivutta</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> (=iti, thus+vutta</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> P P.P. of vatti,

	superiority lit., connected with I.</font></p>

	<p><font>Complex Compounds</font></p>

	<p><font><strong>554.</strong> Compounds, as
	above explained, may themselves become either the first or the
	last member of another compound, or two compounds may be brought
	together to form a new one, and this new one again may become a
	member of another compound, and so on to almost any length, thus
	forming compounds within compounds. These compounds are mostly
	used relatively that is, they are bahubbihi. The student ought to
	bear in mind that, the older the language is, the fewer are these
	complex compounds, and the later the language, the more numerous
	do they become; it therefore follows that long compounds are a
	sign of decay and, to a certain extent, a test as to the relative
	age of a text.</font></p>

	<p><font color="#0000FF"><u>Examples</u></font><font><br>
	vara&#7751;arukkham&#363;le, at the foot of the vara&#7751;a tree, is a
	tappurisa compound in the genitive relation, and is resolved as
	follows: vara&#7751;arukkhassa m&#363;le; vara&#7751;arukkhassa is itself a
	kammadharaya compound=vara&#7751;a eva rukkha. It is therefore a
	tappurisa compound, the first member of which is a kammadharaya
	compound.<br>
	mara&#7751;abhayatajjito, terrified by the fear of death, a bahubbihi
	qualifying a noun understood, and is a tappurisa in the
	instrumentive relation: mara&#7751;abhayena tajjito; mara&#7751;abhaya is
	itself a tappurisa in the ablative: maran&#257; bhaya.<br>

	produced by the power accumulated during an immense period of
	time, the whole is a bahubbihi feminine in the Instrumentive.</font></p>

	<p><font>We resolve it as:
	aparimitak&#257;lasa&#241;citapu&#241;&#241;abala, a tappurisa
	determining nibbatt&#257;ya;<br>
	aparimitak&#257;lasa&#241;citapu&#241;&#241;a, a kammadharaya
	determining bala;<br>
	aparimitak&#257;lasa&#241;cita, a kammadharaya determining
	pu&#241;&#241;a;<br>
	aparimitak&#257;la, a kammadharaya determining sa&#241;cita;<br>
	lastly aparimita is a kammadharaya=a+parimita.</font></p>

	<p><font>In its uncompounded state, it would run
	as follows: aparimite k&#257;le sa&#241;citassa
	pu&#241;&#241;assa balena nibbatt&#257;ya.</font></p>

	<p><font>Remark. The student should follow the
	above method in resolving compounds.</font></p>

	<p><font>Changes of certain words in compounds.</font></p>

	<p><font><strong>555.</strong> Some words, when
	compounded, change their final vowel; when last members of a
	bahubbihi, they, of course, assume the ending of the three
	genders, according to the gender of the noun they determine. The
	most common are here given:</font></p>

	<p><font>go, a cow, bullock, becomes gu, gavo or
	gava</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font>:<br>
	pa&#241;cagu, bartered with five cows (pa&#241;cahi gohi kito);

	<hr /><p id="ch13" align="center"><font size="4"><strong>A
	Practical Grammar of the P&#257;li Language<br>
	Chapter 13</strong></font></p>

	<p><font color="#FF0000" size="4"><strong>Derivation</strong></font></p>

	<p><font><strong>558.</strong> We have now come
	to a most important part of the grammar; the formation of nouns
	and adjectives otherwise called Derivation.</font></p>

	<p><font><strong>559.</strong> In P</font><font
	size="3">&#257;</font><font>li,
	almost every declinable stem can be traced back to a primary
	element called a Root.</font></p>

	<p><font><strong>560.</strong> A root is a
	primitive element of the language incapable of any grammatical
	analysis, and expressing an abstract idea. It is common in
	European languages to express the idea contained in the root by
	means of the infinitive, e.g. &#8730;gam, to go, but it must be borne
	in mind that the root is not an infinitive, nor indeed a verb or
	noun, but simply a primary element expressing a vague indefinite
	idea. This indefinite idea is developed out of the root and is
	made to ramify into a diversity of meanings, both abstract and
	concrete, by means of suffixes.</font></p>

	<p><font><strong>561.</strong> The roots of the P</font><font
	size="3">&#257;</font><font>li
	language, with slight variations in form, easily recognizable to
	the trained eye, are common with those of Sanskrit and
	consequently with many of the roots of the lndo-European
	Languages.</font></p>

	<p><font><strong>562.</strong> Every true root is
	monosyllabic as: &#8730;nas, to perish; &#8730;bh</font><font size="3">&#257;</font><font>, to shine;
	&#8730;ruh, to grow; &#8730;pac, to cook. Roots which have more than one
	syllable are the result of (a) the union of a verbal prefix with
	the root itself, both having become inseparable in the expression
	of a particular idea; for instance: &#8730;sa</font><font size="3">&#7749;</font><font>gam: to fight,
	=sam+&#8730;gam, lit, to come together, to close in upon; and (b) of
	reduplication (372ff) as &#8730;j</font><font size="3">&#257;</font><font>gar, to be wakeful, from &#8730;gar (Sanks. &#8730;gr) to
	awake.</font></p>

	<p><font><strong>563.</strong> There are two
	great divisions of Derivation:<br>
	(i) kita (k¨t), or Primary.<br>
	(ii) taddhita, or Secondary.</font></p>

	<p><font><strong>564.</strong> Primary
	Derivatives are formed from the root itself and Secondary
	Derivatives from the Primary Derivatives.</font></p>

	<p><font><strong>565.</strong> Native grammarians
	recognise a third derivation, which they call u</font><font
	size="3">&#7751;&#257;</font><font>di
	(u</font><font size="3">&#7751;</font><font>+</font><font size="3">&#257;</font><font>di), from the suffix u</font><font size="3">&#7751;</font><font> by which a few
	words are derived. But the u</font><font size="3">&#7751;&#257;</font><font>di derivation is very arbitrary, and the
	connection between the noun and the root is not clear, either in
	meaning or in form. These u</font><font size="3">&#7751;&#257;</font><font>di derivatives are included in the kita
	Derivation; u</font><font size="3">&#7751;&#257;</font><font>di suffixes are therefore included in the
	kita-Suffixes and will be distinguished by an asterisk (*).</font></p>

	<p><font><strong>566.</strong> We shall therefore
	in the present chapter, treat of Primary and Secondary
	derivation. A few hints only will be given on the u</font><font
	size="3">&#7751;&#257;</font><font>di
	derivation.</font></p>

	<p><font><strong>567.</strong> When Suffixes,
	both primary (kita) and secondary (taddhita) are added to roots,
	nouns or adjectives gu</font><font size="3">&#7751;</font><font>a (103) frequently takes place; that is, a may be
	lengthened to </font><font size="3">&#257;</font><font>, and i and u be respectively changed to e and o.</font></p>

	<p><font><strong>568.</strong> Whenever gu</font><font
	size="3">&#7751;</font><font>a takes
	place by the addition of a suffix, native grammarians put an
	indicatory sign before or after the suffix to show that gu</font><font
	size="3">&#7751;</font><font>a is to
	take place; this indicatory sign is generally the letter </font><font
	size="3">&#7751;</font><font> and
	sometimes the letter r. For instance: &#8730;cur, to steal, +suffix </font><font
	size="3">&#7751;</font><font>a=cora, a
	thief. Here, the true suffix is a, the letter </font><font
	size="3">&#7751;</font><font> being
	simply indicatory that guna change must take place; again, &#8730;kar,
	to do, +</font><font size="3">&#7751;</font><font>a=k</font><font size="3">&#257;</font><font>ra, a doer. But &#8730;kar +suffix a=kara, a doer; in
	this last example no guna takes place and therefore , the suffix
	has not the indicatory sign. This sign is called by grammarians:
	anubandha. It is therefore clear that the anubandha or
	&quot;indicatory sign of guna&quot; is not part of the suffix.</font></p>

	<p><font><strong>569.</strong> European
	grammarians as a rule do not note the anubandha, but in this book
	it will be noted and put within brackets, and in small type,
	after the true suffix, thus: (</font><font size="3">&#7751;</font><font>)a, or k</font><font
	size="3">&#257;</font><font>(</font><font
	size="3">&#7751;</font><font>). the
	true suffixes will come first, printed in bold type.</font></p>

	<p><font><strong>570.</strong> Again, some
	suffixes are shown by native grammarians by means of some
	conventional signs; e.g. </font><font size="3">&#7751;</font><font>vu is the conventional sign for suffix aka; yu is
	that for ana</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font>. Such conventional signs will be shown within
	brackets, after the true suffix, as; ana</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font>(yu); this means
	that ana</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> is the true suffix, yu the conventional sign
	used by native grammarians to represent the suffix ana</font><font
	size="3">&#7747;</font><font>.</font></p>

	<p><font><strong>571.</strong> It must be
	remembered that sometimes even some of the prefixes explained in
	(514) undergo gu</font><font size="3">&#7751;</font><font>a as: virajja+ka=virajjaka; pa&#7789;ipada+(</font><font
	size="3">&#7751;</font><font>)a=p</font><font
	size="3">&#257;</font><font>&#7789;ip</font><font
	size="3">&#257;</font><font>da;
	vinaya+(</font><font size="3">&#7751;</font><font>)ika=venayika.</font></p>

	<p><font><strong>572.</strong> Before some
	suffixes, (generally those with the indicatory </font><font
	size="3">&#7751;</font><font> final c
	of the root is changed to k, and final j to g; as &#8730;pac+(</font><font
	size="3">&#7751;</font><font>)a=p</font><font
	size="3">&#257;</font><font>ka, a
	cook; &#8730;ruj+(</font><font size="3">&#7751;</font><font>)a=roga, disease.</font></p>

	<p><font><strong>573.</strong> The final vowel of
	a stem may be elided before a suffix.</font></p>

	<p><font><strong>574.</strong> The rules of
	sandhi and assimilation are regularly applied.</font></p>

	<p><font color="#0000FF" size="4"><strong>(i)
	Primary Derivatives (kita)</strong></font></p>

	<p><font><strong>575.</strong> As has been said
	already Primary Derivatives are formed directly from the roots by
	means of certain suffixes; these suffixes are called kita
	suffixes.</font></p>

	<p><font><strong>576.</strong> The kita suffixes
	are given below in alphabetical order to faciliate reference.</font></p>

	<p><font>a- (a) (</font><font size="3">&#7751;</font><font>) (a). By means of
	this suffix are formed an extremely large number of derivatives,
	some of which take gu</font><font size="3">&#7751;</font><font>a and some of which do not. It forms nouns,
	(substantive and adjective) showing:</font></p>

	size="3">&#257;</font><font>ra, a

	<p><font>3rd- abstract nouns of action:

	step, succession, order; &#8730;kamp, to shake+a=kampa, shaking,
	trembling; &#8730;yuj, to join+a=yoga, joining.</font></p>

	<p><font>4th- It forms adjectives: &#8730;kar+a=k</font><font
	size="3">&#257;</font><font>ra,
	doing, making, also kara, causing, making; &#8730;car, to walk, roam,
	c</font><font size="3">&#257;</font><font>ra, walking, roaming, and also cara, do; &#8730;plu,
	to swim, float+a=plava, swimming, floating.</font></p>

	<p><font>The student will readily understand that
	the root may be preceded by any prefix:<br>
	sam+&#8730;gam+a=sa</font><font size="3">&#7749;</font><font>g</font><font size="3">&#257;</font><font>ma, assembly; pa+&#8730;vis, to enter+a=pavesa,
	entrance; anu+&#8730;sar to go, move, walk+a=anusara, following. The
	same remark applies to all the other suffixes.</font></p>

	<p><font><strong>577.</strong> From the
	adjectives formed by this suffix (4th), are formed the upapada
	compounds (552):<br>
	kammak</font><font size="3">&#257;</font><font>ro=kamma</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> k</font><font size="3">&#257;</font><font>ro (kamma</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> karot</font><font size="3">&#299;</font><font>'ti), the doer of the act; kumbhak</font><font
	size="3">&#257;</font><font>ro=khumbha</font><font
	size="3">&#7747; </font><font>k</font><font
	size="3">&#257;</font><font>ro
	(kumbha</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> karot</font><font size="3">&#299;</font><font>'ti), the maker of the pot, potter.</font></p>

	<p><font><strong>578.</strong> Very similar in
	nature with the upapada compounds are those compounds which are
	the names of persons. In our opinion they are purely and simply
	upapadas, but Kacch</font><font size="3">&#257;</font><font>yana has the following rule: &quot;sa</font><font
	size="3">&#241;&#241;&#257;</font><font>ya</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> a nu&quot; that is, to form a proper name,
	suffix nu (=</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font>=Accus. case) is added to the 1st member of the
	compound, which is the direct object of the root which forms the
	2nd member and after which the suffix a is added to denote the
	agent: arindama, the subduer of his enemies=ari, enemy +</font><font
	size="3">&#7747;</font><font>(nu)+&#8730;dam,
	to subdue+a. So vessantara, who has crossed over to the
	merchants, (vessa +</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font>(nu)+&#8730;tar, to cross+a); ta</font><font size="3">&#7751;</font><font>ha</font><font
	size="3">&#7749;</font><font>kara,
	creating desire=tanh</font><font size="3">&#257;</font><font>, desire +</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font>(nu)+kar+a. The name of a Buddha.</font></p>

	<p><font>It will be seen from the above examples
	that the 1st member is in the Acc. case and is governed by the
	2nd member which is an agent-noun formed by the suffix a.</font></p>

	<p><font>Remark. The nouns formed by a are
	masculine: they form the feminine according to rules (183), and
	the same applies to the adjectives (197).</font></p>

	<p><font>abha*- Used to form the names of some
	animals; the derivation is obscure. kalabha, or ka</font><font
	size="3">&#7735;</font><font>abha, a
	young elephant, from &#8730;kal, to drive, to sound; usabha, a bull
	from &#8730;us, (Sansk. ¨·), to go, flow, push; sarabha, a fabulous
	eight-legged kind of deer, from &#8730;sar (Sansk. </font><font
	size="3">&#149;</font><font>¨),
	to injure, break, tear; karabha, a camel, from &#8730;kar, to do.</font></p>

	<p><font>aka (</font><font size="3">&#7751;</font><font>v)-forms a
	numerous class of action-nouns and adjectives with gu</font><font
	size="3">&#7751;</font><font>a of the
	radical vowel:<br>
	&#8730;kar, to make, do+aka=karaka, making, causing or maker, doer;
	&#8730;gah, to take, receive+aha=gahaka, taking, receiving, a
	receiver: sometimes a -y is inserted between aka and a root
	ending in a vowel, especially long </font><font size="3">&#257;</font><font>: &#8730;d</font><font
	size="3">&#257;</font><font>, to
	give +aka=d</font><font size="3">&#257;</font><font>yaka, a giver.<br>
	Remark. The feminine of these derivatives is generally in k</font><font
	size="3">&#257;</font><font> or
	ik</font><font size="3">&#257;</font><font>.</font></p>

	<p><font>ala*-forming a few nouns of doubtful
	derivation from, it is said, the roots: &#8730;pa&#7789;, to split, slit;<br>
	&#8730;kus, to heap, bring together, cut; &#8730;kal, to drive, sound,
	throw, etc.; pa&#7789;ala, covering, membrane, roof; kusala, that
	which is capable of cutting sin, meritorious act. These nouns are
	neuter.</font></p>

	<p><font>an- only a few words are derived from
	this suffix: &#8730;r</font><font size="3">&#257;</font><font>j, to rule +an=r</font><font size="3">&#257;</font><font>jan, a king,
	ruler.<br>
	Remark. Nouns in an have the Nom. Sing. in </font><font size="3">&#257;</font><font> (l56).</font></p>

	<p><font>ana (yu)- this suffix forms an immense
	number of derivative nouns and adjectives. The nouns are neuter,
	or fem. in </font><font size="3">&#257;</font><font>; the adjectives are of the three genders. Gu</font><font
	size="3">&#7751;</font><font>a may or
	may not take place; it is however, more common with the
	adjectives. Nouns: &#8730;pac, to cook +ana=pacana</font><font
	size="3">&#7747;</font><font>, the
	cooking; &#8730;gah, to take +ana=gaha&#7749;a</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font>, the seizing,
	taking; &#8730;&#7789;h</font><font size="3">&#257;</font><font>, to stand +ana=&#7789;h</font><font size="3">&#257;</font><font>na</font><font
	size="3">&#7747;</font><font>, a
	place. Adjectives: pa+&#8730;nud, to push, move +ana=panudano,
	removing, dispelling; &#8730;ghus, to sound +ana=ghosano, sounding;
	&#8730;kudh, to be angry +ana=kodhano, angry. The fem. of these
	adjectives is sometimes in </font><font size="3">&#257;</font><font>, sometimes in </font><font size="3">&#299;</font><font>. Fem. &#8730;sev, to
	serve, stay by +ana=sevan</font><font size="3">&#257;</font><font>, also, sevana</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font>, service,
	following; &#8730;kar, to execute +ana=k</font><font size="3">&#257;</font><font>ran</font><font
	size="3">&#257;</font><font>,
	agony, torture.</font></p>

	<p><font>as- This suffix forms a not very large,
	but important class of words, which have already been explained
	(160); gu</font><font size="3">&#7751;</font><font>a sometimes takes place; they are declined like
	manas (59); their Nom. Sing. is in o. &#8730;vac, to say, speak
	+as=vacas (vaco), speech, word; &#8730;tij, to be sharp +as=tejas
	(tejo), sharpness, splendour.</font></p>

	<p><font size="3">&#257;</font><font>ni*-Rarely found, it properly does not form
	nouns, but a vituperative negative imperative, with the
	prohibitive particle a (242, a) before the root, and a dative of
	the person who is forbidden to act: agam</font><font size="3">&#257;</font><font>ni=a+&#8730;gam+</font><font
	size="3">&#257;</font><font>ni,
	you are not to go! as in &quot;paradesa</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> te agam</font><font
	size="3">&#257;</font><font>ni&quot;,
	&quot;You are not to go elsewhere!&quot; &quot;te ida</font><font
	size="3">&#7747;</font><font> kamma</font><font
	size="3">&#7747;</font><font> akar</font><font
	size="3">&#257;</font><font>ni
	(a+&#8730;kar+</font><font size="3">&#257;</font><font>ni).</font></p>

	<p><font size="3">&#257;</font><font>vi=vi (t</font><font size="3">&#257;</font><font>vi)- is used as has already been seen, to form
	participles (231) so also:</font></p>

	<p><font size="3">&#257;</font><font>na (448), also at, ant=nta (440) so that the
	Perf. Active, the Pres. Active and the Reflective Participles are
	considered by native grammarians as coming under the head of kita
	Derivatives. The same remark applies to the P.P.P.</font></p>

	<p><font>dhu- so given by native grammarians is,
	properly adhu; it forms but a few derivatives and is only another
	form of thu=athu (see below).</font></p>

	<p><font>i- Forms a large class of derivatives,
	Masc., Fem. and Neuter, as well as a few adjectives. The nouns
	may be agent-nouns or abstract. But the derivation is not always
	quite clear (principally of neuter nouns), hence, some grammars
	include this suffix among the u</font><font size="3">&#7751;&#257;</font><font>di.
	Strengthening takes place in a few roots. Masc.: &#8730;ku, to sound
	sing+i=kavi, one who sings=a poet; &#8730;mun=man to think+i=muni, one
	who thinks=a sage. Fem. &#8730;lip, to smear, rub+i=lipi, a rubbing
	over, writing; &#8730;ruc, to shine, to please+i=ruci, light,
	pleasure. Neut.: akkhi, eye; aggi, fire, a&#7789;&#7789;hi, bone, and a few
	others, of very doubtful derivation. Adj. &#8730;suc, to beam, glow,
	burn+i=suci, beaming, clear, pure.</font></p>

	<p><font>By means of this suffix is formed from
	&#8730;dh</font><font size="3">&#257;</font><font>, to bear, hold, a derivative: dhi, which forms
	many compounds, mostly masculine: sam+dhi=sandhi, connection,
	union (in grammar=euphony); udadhi, the ocean=uda, water+dhi,
	holding (uda+&#8730;dh</font><font size="3">&#257;</font><font>+i); others are: nidhi, a receptacle (ni+&#8730;dh</font><font
	size="3">&#257;</font><font>+i);
	paridhi, circle, halo (pari+&#8730;dh</font><font size="3">&#257;</font><font>+i).</font></p>

	<p><font>Similarly, from, &#8730;d</font><font
	size="3">&#257;</font><font> to
	give with prefix </font><font size="3">&#257;</font><font>, we obtain: </font><font size="3">&#257;</font><font>di (=</font><font
	size="3">&#257;</font><font>+&#8730;d</font><font
	size="3">&#257;</font><font>+i)=and
	so forth, and so on, etc, lit.=beginning. The word </font><font
	size="3">&#257;</font><font>di is
	much used at the end of compounds.</font></p>

	<p><font>icca (ricca), and iriya(ririya),-are
	given by kacch</font><font size="3">&#257;</font><font>yana as kita prefixes, but in reality they are
	not: both are suffixes of the F.P.P. (466); they are found only
	in the two examples: kicca and kiriya, (lit., what is to be done)
	business: &#8730;kar+icca=kicca (with elision of radical a and of r)
	&#8730;kar+iriya=kiriya with elision of radical a and of r). But the
	true derivation* is kar+tya=kitya (with elision of ar and
	insertion of i)=kicca, according to the usual rules (74). *Sans.
	&#8730;k¨+tya=k¨tya ; k¨+ya=k¨ya=kriya.</font></p>

	<p><font>ika- is given for the only root: &#8730;gam,
	to go: gamika, one who goes.</font></p>

	<p><font>in=</font><font size="3">&#299;</font><font> (</font><font size="3">&#7751;&#299;</font><font>)- This forms a very great number of derivatives
	whose stem ends in in, and the Nom. Sing. </font><font size="3">&#299;</font><font> (see 137, 173);
	they are properly possessive adjectives, sometimes used
	substantively. Gu</font><font size="3">&#7751;</font><font>a as a rule takes place. &#8730;gah, to take,
	receive+in=g</font><font size="3">&#257;</font><font>hin (g</font><font size="3">&#257;</font><font>hi), taking, catching; &#8730;kra+in=k</font><font
	size="3">&#257;</font><font>rin
	(k</font><font size="3">&#257;</font><font>r</font><font size="3">&#299;</font><font>), doing; p</font><font size="3">&#257;</font><font>pak</font><font size="3">&#257;</font><font>r</font><font size="3">&#299;</font><font>, a sinner: &#8730;y</font><font size="3">&#257;</font><font>, to go, y</font><font
	size="3">&#257;</font><font>yin
	(y</font><font size="3">&#257;</font><font>y</font><font size="3">&#299;</font><font>), going; nagaray</font><font size="3">&#257;</font><font>y</font><font
	size="3">&#299;</font><font>, going
	to the town; &#8730;d</font><font size="3">&#257;</font><font>, to give, d</font><font size="3">&#257;</font><font>yin, (d</font><font size="3">&#257;</font><font>y</font><font size="3">&#299;</font><font>), giving, a giver. Note that a y is inserted
	between the suffix and the roots ending in </font><font size="3">&#257;</font><font> long. The
	Feminine is formed according to rules (189).</font></p>

	<p><font>ina- A few nouns are formed by this
	suffix; there is no gu</font><font size="3">&#7751;</font><font>a: &#8730;sup, to sleep+ina =supina</font><font
	size="3">&#7747; </font><font>(Neut.),
	a dream, sleep. The derivation of some nouns and adjectives from
	this suffix is not apparent and clear, and it is also classed as
	an u</font><font size="3">&#7751;&#257;</font><font>di; &#8730;dakkh, to be able, skilful+ina=dakkhi</font><font
	size="3">&#7751;</font><font>a, able,
	southern.</font></p>

	<p><font>ira-The derivitives from this, nouns and
	adjectives, are few; there is no gu</font><font size="3">&#7751;</font><font>a: &#8730;ruc, to shine
	+ira=rucira, brilliant, beautiful; &#8730;vaj, to be strong
	+ira=vajira, thunderbolt.</font></p>

	<p><font>iya, i&#7789;&#7789;ha- are the suffixes used for
	the comparison of adjectives (238).</font></p>

	<p><font>isa*-forms a few nouns, mostly Masc., of
	rather obscure derivation: &#8730;p&#363;r, to fill+isa=purisa, a man,
	person; &#8730;sun, to oppress+isa=sunisa, an oppressor; &#8730;il, to
	shake, come+isa=ilisa, one who shakes; &#8730;mah to be
	great+isa=mahisa, mighty, a buffalo.</font></p>

	<p><font>itta* (</font><font size="3">&#7751;</font><font>itta)- is said to
	express multitude (?): the root is gu</font><font size="3">&#7751;</font><font>ated: &#8730;vad, to
	speak, to play (music)+itta=v</font><font size="3">&#257;</font><font>ditta</font><font
	size="3">&#7747;</font><font>, the
	multitude of those that play music, an orchestra. This suffix and
	its derivatives are incomprehensible; but see -tta, -tra where
	its probable formation will be explained.</font></p>

	<p><font size="3">&#299;</font><font>vara*-forms
	a few Neut. nouns of doubtful connection with the roots from
	which they are derived: &#8730;ci, to gather, to depend upon+</font><font
	size="3">&#299;</font><font>vara=c</font><font
	size="3">&#299;</font><font>vara</font><font
	size="3">&#7747;</font><font>, a
	monk's garment, that which is heaped upon or depended upon; &#8730;p</font><font
	size="3">&#257;</font><font>, to
	drink+</font><font size="3">&#299;</font><font>vara=p</font><font size="3">&#299;</font><font>vara</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font>, beverage, that which is to be drunk.</font></p>

	<p><font>ka is added to very few roots which take
	gu</font><font size="3">&#7751;</font><font>a; it forms agent-nouns and adjectives: &#8730;vad, to
	speak+ka=v</font><font size="3">&#257;</font><font>daka, one who speaks, a musician; playing (adj.);
	&#8730;dah, to burn+ka=d</font><font size="3">&#257;</font><font>haka, burning (adj.). Note that these two words
	would be better derived from suffix aka (see above) &#8730;sukh
	(Sansk. cus)+ka=sukkha, dry, dried up; &#8730;thu (Sansk. stu) to
	dribble, drop+ka=thoka, a little, ka often takes a connecting
	vowel i or u before a root, and forms the suffixes ika, uka (see
	also).</font></p>

	<p><font>la generally with connecting vowels: a,
	or i before it. la is but another form of ra (see also): &#8730;thu,
	to be thick, strong+la=th&#363;la, thick, fat; &#8730;cap to waver,
	tremble+(a) la=capala, tremulous, fickle, giddy; &#8730;p</font><font
	size="3">&#257;</font><font>, to
	keep, guard+la=pala, a guardian; &#8730;an, to breathe, blow
	softly+(i) la=anila, wind, breeze.</font></p>

	<p><font>l</font><font size="3">&#257;&#7751;</font><font>a- as well as y</font><font size="3">&#257;&#7751;</font><font>a given as
	primary suffixes, are not at all suffixes; the true suffix is </font><font
	size="3">&#257;&#7751;</font><font>a,
	which is a taddhita suffix (see also).</font></p>

	<p><font>ma- forms some abstract nouns,
	agent-nouns, and some adjectives: &#8730;bh</font><font size="3">&#299;</font><font>, to fear, be
	afraid of +ma=bh</font><font size="3">&#299;</font><font>ma, terrible, fearful; &#8730;ghar (sansk. ghr) to be
	warm, to glow+ma=gharma=ghamma, heat, warmth. (Note the
	assimilation of r (80); &#8730;thu, to praise, thoma, praise; &#8730;dh&#363;,
	to shake, move hither and thither+ma=dh&#363;ma smoke. This suffix,
	in P</font><font size="3">&#257;</font><font>li, becomes nearly confounded with the next: man,
	and native grammarians are often at a loss in choosing between
	these two suffixes: the reason is that no word in P</font><font
	size="3">&#257;</font><font>li
	being allowed to end in a consonant, they have included the stems
	in an in the vowel declension (152, 156-c, 157-a).</font></p>

	<p><font>man- (given as ramma as well as man by
	kacch</font><font size="3">&#257;</font><font>yana) forms action nouns, Masc. and Neuter; in a
	few cases the noun being both Masc. and Neut.; the stems are in
	an the Nom, in </font><font size="3">&#257;</font><font>, o, or </font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font>:<br>
	&#8730;dhar; to hold, bear+man=dhammo, dhamma</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font>, nature,
	characteristic, duty, the Law;<br>
	&#8730;kar+man=kamma</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font>, action, karma (Note the assimilation of r),
	&#8730;bh</font><font size="3">&#299;</font><font> to fear+man=bhemo, fearful, terrible; &#8730;khi, to
	destroy, make an end of+ma=khemo, secure, peaceful, khema</font><font
	size="3">&#7747;</font><font>, safety,
	happiness. Most of the derivatives from man, have migrated to the
	class of those formed by the last suffix (ma).</font></p>

	<p><font>m</font><font size="3">&#257;</font><font>na- This is the suffix of the Pres. Part.
	Reflective already seen (447). (See, </font><font size="3">&#257;</font><font>na, above).</font></p>

	<p><font>mi- The number of derivatives from this
	suffix is very restricted, they are Masc. or Fem. There is no gu</font><font
	size="3">&#7751;</font><font>a.
	&#8730;bh&#363;, to exist, become+mi=bh&#363;mi, the earth, ground, a place;
	&#8730;u (sansk. v), to roll, turn from side to side+mi=&#363;mi (&#363;rmi,
	note the elision of radical r), a wave.</font></p>

	<p><font>na- The use of this suffix in forming a
	certain number of P.P.P. has been explained (458); it also forms
	a few nouns; the root takes no gu&#7749;a, but through assimilation,
	the root is not always recognisable: &#8730;var, to cover
	enclose+na=va</font><font size="3">&#7751;&#7751;</font><font>a (80, 83), colour, external appearance; &#8730;sup
	(Sansk. svap) to sleep+na=soppa (=S. svapna), sleep; &#8730;phar (also
	phur=S. sphur, sphr), to shake, to make a jerky motion+na=pa</font><font
	size="3">&#7751;&#7751;</font><font>a a
	feather, wing. From &#8730;t</font><font size="3">&#257;</font><font>s (S. trs), ta</font><font size="3">&#7751;</font><font>h</font><font
	size="3">&#257;</font><font>,
	thirst, craving; &#8730;ji, to conquer+na=jina, conqueror.</font></p>

	<p><font>Connected with this na, are the suffixes
	ina, una (see also); also: tana, (=S. tna), from this last is
	derived the word ratana, gift, blessing, jewel, from &#8730;r</font><font
	size="3">&#257;</font><font>, to
	bestow+tna=tana (note that radical </font><font size="3">&#257;</font><font> is shortened
	through the influence of the double consonant to tna see 34).</font></p>

	<p><font>ni- from this we obtain but a few nouns.
	Fem. &#8730;h</font><font size="3">&#257;</font><font>, to quit, forsake+ni=h</font><font size="3">&#257;</font><font>ni,

	messenger; &#8730;s&#363; to impel, to set in motion+ta=s&#363;ta, a
	charioteer. The student will remark that even these nouns look
	very much like P.P.P. (see. 452 remarks). The suffix ita, also
	connected with the- P.P.P. (452, ii), forms a few derivatives of
	doubtful connection with roots: palita, grey; lohita, red;
	harita, green, etc.</font></p>

	(with elision of n), dear, gladsome.</font></p>

	<p><font>u (ru and u)- Although making a large
	number of derivatives, substantive and adjectives, as the
	connection of the meaning with the root, is, in many, cases, not
	easily traced, this suffix is classed with the u</font><font
	size="3">&#7751;&#257;</font><font>di;

	<p><font><strong>579.</strong> </font><font
	color="#0000FF" size="4"><strong>(ii) Secondary
	Derivatives (taddhita)</strong></font></p>

	<p><font>Remarks.<br>
	(a) These derivatives are called &quot;Secondary&quot; because
	they are formed by means of suffixes from the the
	&quot;Primary&quot; derivatives explained in the kita derivation
	above.<br>
	(b) Secondary derivatives are also formed from pronominal bases
	(336).<br>
	(c) As in kita, gu</font><font size="3">&#7751;</font><font>a may or may not take place.</font></p>

	<p><font><strong>580.</strong> The following
	remarks about the meaning of the secondary derivation, should be
	well noted:<br>
	(i) The great bulk of taddhita suffixes form adjectives from
	nouns.<br>
	(ii) These adjectives are very freely used as substantives, the
	Masc. and Fem. being generally nouns denoting the agent, while in
	the Neut. they are abstract.<br>
	(iii) The final vowel of a word is often elided before a taddhita
	suffix.<br>
	(iv) The gu</font><font size="3">&#7751;</font><font>a affects mostly the first syllable of the word
	to which the suffix is added.</font></p>

	<p><font><strong>581.</strong> The following is a
	list in alphabetical order of the taddhita suffixes.</font></p>

	<p><font>a (</font><font size="3">&#7751;</font><font>a, and a)- An extremely large number of
	derivatives are formed by means of this suffix. It is added to
	nouns and to adjectives used substantively; these derivatives are
	essentially adjectives, used in most cases substantively. They
	primarily express connection with, relations with or dependence
	on that denoted by the &quot;primary derivatives&quot;; this
	relation is necessarily of many kinds, as:</font></p>

	<p><font>(1) patronymics; the Masc. denotes the
	son of, the Fem., the daughter of and the Neuter the

	<p><font color="#0000FF" size="4"><strong>Roots
	Used as Suffixes (kvi)</strong></font></p>

	<p><font><strong>582.</strong> &quot;kvi&quot; is
	an imaginary suffix denoting that the root itself is to be
	considered as the suffix. When a root ends in a consonant, this
	consonant is elided: &#8730;gam=ga, &#8730;ghan, to kill=gha. As these form
	primarily adjectives, they assume, in certain cases, but not
	always, the endings of the three genders.</font></p>

	<p><font><strong>583.</strong> The student must
	bear in mind that native grammarians include kvi in kita. As,
	however,<br>
	they are used as suffixes added after Primary and Secondary
	derivatives and indeclinables, I have<br>
	preferred to treat them separately.</font></p>

	<p><font><strong>584.</strong> A list of the
	principal roots used as suffixes is here given.</font></p>

	<p><font>bh&#363;- (&#8730;bh&#363;, to be), has generally the
	meaning denoted by the verb itself: abhi+bh&#363;=abhibh&#363;,
	mastering, overcoming, a conqueror (abhibhavi, to overcome);
	vi+bh&#363;=vibhu, arising, expanding, ruler, lord (vibhavati, to
	arise, expand); sam+bh&#363;=sambh&#363;, offspring, progeny; sambhavati,
	to be produced, to spring from.</font></p>

	<p><font>da- (&#8730;d</font><font size="3">&#257;</font><font>, to give,
	bestow); amata, imortality +da=amatado, he who bestows or confers
	immortality, conferring immortality; lokahita, the world's
	welfare +da=lokahitado, bestowing, or wishing for, the world's
	welfare.</font></p>

	<p><font>ga- (&#8730;gam to go); p</font><font
	size="3">&#257;</font><font>ra,
	the further shore +ga=parago, gone to the further shore, viz. to
	Nirvana; kula, family +upa, near +ga=kulupago, one who goes near
	a family, a family adviser.</font></p>

	<p><font>g&#363;- (a collateral form of &#8730;gam); addh</font><font
	size="3">&#257;</font><font>,
	distance +g&#363;=addhag&#363;, going to a distance, a traveller; p</font><font

	<p><font>gha- (&#8730;ghan=han [59, note]) to strike,
	kill; pa&#7789;i, back, in return +gha=pa&#7789;igho, hatred.</font></p>

	<p><font>ja- (&#8730;j</font><font size="3">&#257;</font><font>, jan, to be
	born, produced): pa</font><font size="3">&#7749;</font><font>ka, mud +ja=pa</font><font size="3">&#7749;</font><font>kaja, produced in
	the mud, a lotus; a</font><font size="3">&#7749;</font><font>da, an egg +ja=a</font><font size="3">&#7749;</font><font>daja, born from an
	egg=a bird.</font></p>

	<p><font>ji- (&#8730;ji, to conquer); m</font><font
	size="3">&#257;</font><font>ra,
	the enemy of Buddha +ji=m</font><font size="3">&#257;</font><font>raji, conqueror of Mara.</font></p>

	<p><font>pa- (&#8730;p</font><font size="3">&#257;</font><font>, to drink);
	pada, a foot +pa=p</font><font size="3">&#257;</font><font>dapo, drinking by the foot (root), a tree.</font></p>

	form of &#8730;khan, to dig) pari, round +kha=parikha, that which is
	dug all round=a moat.</font></p>

	<p><font>dada- properly the base (371-4) of &#8730;d</font><font
	size="3">&#257;</font><font>, but
	considered as a root by some grammarians, is used in the same way
	as da above: sabbak</font><font size="3">&#257;</font><font>madada</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> kumbha</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font>=an all-desire-granting vessel, a vessel which
	grants all desires.</font></p>

	<p><font><strong>585.</strong> The taddhita
	suffixes may be classified as follows:<br>
	Patronymics- a, </font><font size="3">&#257;</font><font>na, </font><font size="3">&#257;</font><font>yana, era, eyya, i, ika.<br>
	Possessive- aka, ika, im</font><font size="3">&#257;</font><font>, in=</font><font size="3">&#299;</font><font>, ra, (ara, ira), so, ss</font><font size="3">&#299;</font><font>, m</font><font
	size="3">&#257;</font><font>(mat,
	mant), min=m</font><font size="3">&#299;</font><font>, va, v</font><font size="3">&#257;</font><font>, (vat, vant), v</font><font size="3">&#299;</font><font>=vin, ta, ina, la.<br>
	Group, collection, multitude- a, ika, ka, t</font><font size="3">&#257;</font><font>.<br>
	State of, quality, abstract idea: bya, eyya, iya, t</font><font
	size="3">&#257;</font><font>,
	tta, ttana, ta.<br>
	Relation (relating to): a, i, ika, ima, kiya.<br>
	The others may be classified as miscellaneous.</font></p>

	<p><font><strong>586.</strong> It will have been
	remarked that some suffixes are merely made up of a principal one
	which has taken the vowel a or i or u before it. Such are: aka,
	ika from ka; aya, iya, from ya; ara, ira, ura from ra; ila from
	la.</font></p>

	<hr /><p id="ch14" align="center"><font size="4"><strong>A
	Practical Grammar of the P&#257;li Language<br>
	Chapter 14</strong></font></p>

	<p><font color="#FF0000" size="4"><strong>Syntax
	(K&#257;raka)</strong></font></p>

	<p><font><strong>587.</strong> Syntax, in
	P&#257;li, does not offer any difficulty for nearly all the
	relations of the substantives, adjectives and pronouns which will
	be explained in this chapter are very often obviated by
	compounding them as has already been explained in the chapter on
	Compounds. The student who has carefully read and mastered the
	Compounds has therefore done much and will understand ordinary
	prose without too much difficulty. However, there are peculiar
	uses of the Cases, without a knowledge of which a thorough
	mastery of the language would be impossible; we therefore invite
	the learner to read attentively the present chapter.</font></p>

	<p><font>(i) </font><font color="#0000FF"
	size="4"><strong>Order of Sentences</strong></font></p>

	<p><font><strong>588.</strong> The order of the
	P&#257;li sentence is very simple in character, compound
	sentences being rather the exception than the rule:</font></p>

	<p><font>(1) Whether the sentence be Simple,
	Compound or Complex, the predicate must always come last.</font></p>

	<p><font>(2) In a simple sentence containing an
	object, the order is: (i) Subject; (ii) object and (iii)
	predicate, as: d&#257;so kamma</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> karoti, the slave
	does the work.</font></p>

	<p><font>(3) Words qualifying the subject or the
	object come before the subject and the object respectively, and
	adverbs before the verb: etetayo puris&#257; mahanta</font><font
	size="3">&#7747;</font><font> siri</font><font
	size="3">&#7747;</font><font> s&#299;gha</font><font
	size="3">&#7747;</font><font>
	p&#257;pu&#7751;i</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font>su, these three men quickly attained to great
	glory.<br>
	Remark. Adverbs of time always come first in the sentence.</font></p>

	<p><font>(4) The conjunctions, pana, but;
	ud&#257;hu, or, are used to form compound sentences; ce, yadi and
	sace, if, complex sentences.</font></p>

	<p><font>(ii) </font><font color="#0000FF"
	size="4"><strong>The Article</strong></font></p>

	<p><font><strong>589.</strong> There are no words
	in P&#257;li corresponding to the English articles; the words
	eko, ekacce, one, a certain are often used in the sense of the
	indefinite article (253); and so, eso, that, this, do the
	function of the definite article: so puriso, the man; s&#257;
	itth&#299;, the woman.</font></p>

	<p><font>Remark. Substantives not preceded by the
	above words may, according to the context, be translated as if
	preceded by the articles: puriso=a man, or, the man.</font></p>

	<p><font>(iii) </font><font color="#0000FF"
	size="4"><strong>Concord</strong></font></p>

	<p><font><strong>590.</strong> Concord of subject
	and predicate.</font></p>

	<p><font>(1) The predicate may be:<br>
	(i) a finite verb: bhikkhu gahapati</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> ov&#257;di, the
	monk admonished the householder;<br>
	(ii) a substantive with the verb &quot;hoti&quot; understood
	after it: yadi ete gu&#7751;&#257;, if these (are=honti) virtues;<br>
	(iii)An adjective with &quot;hoti&quot; also understood: tva</font><font
	size="3">&#7747;</font><font>
	atib&#257;lo, thou (art=asi) very foolish;<br>
	(iv) A P.P.P.used as a finite verb; so pi gato, he too went, lit.
	he too gone.</font></p>

	<p><font>(2) When a finite verb is used as
	predicate, it must agree with the subject in number and person.
	When there are several subjects of different persons, the verb is
	put in the first person plural: so ca tva</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> aha</font><font
	size="3">&#7747;</font><font>
	gacchatha, he thou, and I go. Should there be no subject of the
	first person, the verb is put in the 2nd person plural: so ca tva</font><font
	size="3">&#7747;</font><font>
	gacchatha, he and thou go.</font></p>

	<p><font>(3) In the case of an adjective or a
	P.P.P. taking the place of the predicate, the adj. and the P.P.P.
	must agree with the subject in gender and number: so gato, he
	went; s&#257; gat&#257;, she went; ta</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> gata</font><font
	size="3">&#7747;</font><font>, it
	went; so taru&#7751;o, he is young; s&#257; taru&#7751;&#257;, she is
	young; ta</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> taru&#7751;a</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font>, it is young.</font></p>

	<p><font>(4) But if a substantive stands in the
	place of a verb, no such concord of gender or number needs take
	place; appamado nibbanapada</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> (=nibb&#257;nassa pada</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font>o), vigilance is
	the path to Nirvana.</font></p>

	<p><font color="#FF0000"><strong>Concord of
	Adjective and Substantive</strong></font></p>

	<p><font><strong>591.</strong> An adjective, or
	participle (which is of the nature of an adj.) when not
	compounded with the noun it qualifies, must agree with it in
	gender, number and case.</font></p>

	<p><font color="#FF0000"><strong>Concord of the
	Relative and its Antecedent</strong></font></p>

	<p><font><strong>592.</strong> The relative must
	agree with its antecedent in gender, number and person.</font></p>

	<p><font>(1) The relative may be used by itself,
	without the noun: yo jan&#257;ti so ima</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> ga&#7751;h&#257;tu, he
	who knows let him take this. Note, that in the above the
	demonstrative pronoun so is used as a correlative.</font></p>

	<p><font>(2) The relative is used instead of a
	preceding noun: aha</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> eka</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> up&#257;ya</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> jan&#257;mi, yena amhe ga&#7751;hitu</font><font
	size="3">&#7747;</font><font> no
	sakkissati, I know an expedient by which he will not able to
	seize us.</font></p>

	<p><font>(3) With the noun expressed: yassa
	purisassa buddhi hoti so mahaddhano ti vuccati, to whom there is
	wisdom, he is called very wealthy, he who has wisdom is said to
	be very wealthy.</font></p>

	<p><font>(4) Note that the clause containing the
	relative is put first; sometimes the clause containing the
	correlative is placed first for the sake of emphasis: na so
	pit&#257;yena putto na sikkh&#257;piyati, he is no father by whom
	the son is not made to learn.</font></p>

	<p><font>(iv) </font><font color="#0000FF"
	size="4"><strong>Syntax of Substantives</strong></font></p>

	<p><font><strong>593.</strong> This is properly
	government, for the term &quot;k&#257;raka&quot; expresses the
	relation between the noun and the verb; so that any relation
	existing between words not connected with a verb cannot be called
	a k&#257;raka, consequently the Genitive and the Vocative are not
	considered as cases, for they have no relation whatever with the
	verb; they are therefore called ak&#257;raka, non-cases.</font></p>

	<p><font color="#FF0000"><strong>1. The
	Nominative</strong></font></p>

	<p><font><strong>594.</strong> The Nominative is
	used very much in the same way as in English; it is the subject
	of the verb and the latter must agree with it in number and
	person; see Concord of subject and predicate (590).</font></p>

	<p><font>(i) The Nominative is used in
	apposition: malliko kosalar&#257;j&#257;, Mallika, king of
	Kosala.</font></p>

	<p><font>(ii) It is used absolutely in titles of
	books, that is, it does not take the termination proper to the
	nominative; m&#257;haj&#257;nakaj&#257;taka, the birth.story of
	Mahajanaka.</font></p>

	<p><font color="#FF0000"><strong>2. Genitive</strong></font></p>

	<p><font><strong>595.</strong> The true force of
	the genitive is -of and -'s expressing possession.</font></p>

	<p><font>(i) The genitive therefore is used
	primarily to denote possession: suva&#7751;&#7751;assa r&#257;si, a heap of
	gold; rukkhassa s&#257;kh&#257;, the branch of the tree.</font></p>

	<p><font>(ii) In such examples as the above, the
	genitive is often compounded with the noun it qualifies:
	suva&#7751;&#7751;ar&#257;si.</font></p>

	<p><font>(iii) It denotes the whole of which a
	part only is taken; this is called &quot;partitive
	genitive&quot;: br&#257;hm&#257;&#7751;a</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> so pa&#7751;&#7693;ito, he
	is clever among brahmins; sabbayodh&#257;na</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> atis&#363;ro, the
	bravest of all warriors; tumh&#257;ka</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> pana eken&#257;,
	but even not one of you.</font></p>

	<p><font>(iv) The genitive is used also with
	words expressing, difference, equality, inequality: tassa antara</font><font
	size="3">&#7747;</font><font> na passi</font><font
	size="3">&#7747;</font><font>su, they
	did not see the (its) difference; sadiso pitu, the same as (his)
	father; tulyo pitu equal to his father.<br>
	Remark. In these examples the ablative may also be used: sadiso
	pitar&#257;.</font></p>

	<p><font>(v) Words meaning. dear or the reverse,
	take a genitive: s&#257; br&#257;hma&#7751;assa man&#257;p&#257;, she
	(was) dear to the brahmin.</font></p>

	<p><font>(vi) Likewise words denoting: honour,
	veneration etc.: g&#257;massa p&#363;jito honoured of the village;
	ra&#241;&#241;o m&#257;nito, revered by (of) the king.<br>
	Remark. In these examples the Inst. may also be used: g&#257;mena
	p&#363;jito.</font></p>

	<p><font>(vii) Words of: skill, proficiency,
	etc., and their opposites, govern the genitive: kusal&#257;
	naccag&#299;tassa, clever in dancing and singing.</font></p>

	<p><font>(viii) It is used with words indicating:
	locality, time, distance: amh&#257;ka</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> buddhassa pubbe,
	before our Buddha; g&#257;massa avidure, not far from the
	village; upari tesa</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font>, above them.</font></p>

	<p><font>(ix) Believing in or well disposed
	towards: budhassa pasanno, he has faith in the Buddha.<br>
	Remark. Here the Loc. may also be used: buddhe pasanno.</font></p>

	<p><font>(x) It is used also with words of
	remembering or thinking of (with sorrow), pitying, wishing for,
	giving or apportioning, honouring, cleaning, filling, fearing and
	a few others: m&#257;tussa sarati, he remembers his mother (with
	sorrow); na tesa koci sarati, nobody remembers them; telassa
	davati, he gives oil; p&#363;rati b&#257;lo p&#257;passa, the fool is
	full of evil; sabbe tasanti da&#7751;&#7693;assa, all fear punishment.</font></p>

	<p><font>In these examples the Acc. may be used:
	tela</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> davati.<br>
	Remark. Words of fearing also govern the Abl.: kin nu kho aha</font><font
	size="3">&#7747;</font><font>
	sunakh&#257; bh&#257;yami? Why should I fear the dog?</font></p>

	<p><font>(xi) A genitive with a participle in
	agreement is called a Gen. Absolute. It generally denotes some
	attendant circumstance:<br>
	tassa bhatta</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> bhuttassa udaka</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> aharanti, when he
	had finished his meal they fetched him water.</font></p>

	<p><font>(xii) Some other relations of the
	genitive will present no difficulty, as they have their exact
	parallel in English.</font></p>

	<p><font><strong>596.</strong> It will be seen
	from the remarks above that the genitive is often used instead of
	the Accusative, the Ablative, the Instrumentive and the Locative.
	It is also used adverbially, as kissa, why? It will also be
	remarked that whenever the genitive is dependent on a verb, it is
	so on account of its being used instead of another case, as in:
	m&#257;tussa sarati.</font></p>

	<p><font color="#FF0000"><strong>3. The Dative</strong></font></p>

	<p><font><strong>597.</strong> The person or
	object to or for whom, something is given or done, is put in the
	Dative case. The Dat. is consequently used also as indirect
	object with transitive verbs having an Acc. as direct object.</font></p>

	<p><font>(i) The Dat., then, expresses the
	relations which, in English, are usually denoted by the words to,
	for: bhikkhussa civara</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> deti, he gives a robe to the priest;
	yuddh&#257;ya paccuggacch&#257;mi; I will set out for battle.</font></p>

	<p><font>(ii) The Dat. is governed by verbs
	expressing praise or blame, anger, believing, disbelieving,
	assent, envy, pleasure or displeasure, injury, benefit, approval,
	forgiveness, salutation, blessing, hatred, abuse, concealing,
	worshipping, carrying.</font></p>

	<p><font>Examples: Buddhassa sil&#257;ghate, he
	praises the Buddha; yadi'ha</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> tassa kuppeyya, if I should be angry with him;
	duhayati dis&#257;na</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> ogho, the flood has injured the country; tuyha</font><font
	size="3">&#7747;</font><font>
	saddah&#257;mi, I believe thee; sv&#257;gata</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> te, hail to thee!
	sotthi tuyha</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> hotu, fare thee well! khama me, forgive me!
	mayha</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> sapate he swears at or, reviles me; tassa
	sampa&#7789;icchi, he assented to it; ussuyanti dujjan&#257; gu&#7751;av

	Remark. When the verb &quot;hoti&quot; is used with the Dat. to
	express possession, it is generally put in the singular, even
	when, as in the above example what is possessed is plural.</font></p>

	<p><font>(iv) The word, ala</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font>, enough, fit,
	governs the Dat.: ala</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> kukkucc&#257;ya, enough of doubt! ala</font><font

	<p><font>(vii) The Dat. is also used with the
	verb ma&#241;&#241;ati, to consider, esteem, when contempt is
	implied:<br>

	size="3">&#7747;</font><font>
	s&#257;m&#299;, etc.</font></p>

	<p><font>(vi) Words signifying &quot;to be happy,
	contented, eager&quot;, govern the Loc., as well as the Inst.:<br>
	&#241;&#257;&#7751;asmi</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> ussuko, eager for wisdom, or &#241;&#257;&#7751;ena
	ussako; &#241;&#257;&#7751;asmi</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> pas&#299;dito, contented with wisdom,
	&#241;&#257;&#7751;ena pas&#299;dito.</font></p>

	<p><font>(vii) Words signifying &quot;reverence,
	respect, love, delighting in, saluting, taking, seizing,
	striking, kissing, fond of, adoring,&quot; govern the Loc.:
	p&#257;pasmi</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> ramati mano, the mind delights in evil;
	bhikkh&#363;su abhiv&#257;denti, they salute the monks; p&#257;de

	him in the precipice; purisa</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> s&#299;se paharati, struck the man on the head.</font></p>

	<p><font>(viii) The Loc. is used sometimes to
	show that one does not take any account of something or person:
	rudantasmi</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> d&#257;rake pabbaji, he left the world in spite
	of his son weeping. The Genitive also may be used: rudantassa
	&#257;rakassa pabbaji (See: Locative and Genitive Absolute).</font></p>

	<p><font>(ix) The Loc. is employed to denote
	superiority or inferiority, with the words &quot;upa&quot; and
	&quot;adhi&quot; respectively. upa kh&#257;riya</font><font
	size="3">&#7747;</font><font> do&#7751;o, a
	do&#7751;a is inferior to a kh&#257;ri; adhi brahmadatte
	pa&#241;cal&#257;, the Pancalas are under Brahmadatta's
	supremacy; adhi devesu buddho, the Buddha is above the gods.</font></p>

	<p><font>(x) It is used to denote
	&quot;proximity&quot;: nadiya</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> sassa</font><font

	near his leaf hut there is an elephant-track.</font></p>

	<p><font>(xi) The Loc. is used absolutely with a
	participle in the same case as itself (see, Absolute
	Construction).</font></p>

	<p><font>(xii) In lexicons, the Loc. is used to
	signify &quot;in the sense of&quot; ru sadde, (the root) ru, is
	used in the sense of making noise.&quot;</font></p>

	<p><font>(xiii) Words denoting &quot;fitness,
	suitability&quot; govern the Loc.: tayi na yutta</font><font
	size="3">&#7747;</font><font>, not fit
	for thee; the Gen. is used in the same sense: tava na yutta</font><font
	size="3">&#7747;</font><font>.</font></p>

	<p><font>(xiv) The Loc. is extensively used
	instead of other Cases, and the students must be prepared to meet
	the Loc. where very often he would expect to find some other
	case.<br>
	Let him note that in almost all instances, the Case for which the
	Loc. stands may be and is, used.</font></p>

	<p><font>(xv) The Loc. in used for the Gen, (see,
	above, v).</font></p>

	<p><font>(xvi) It is used for the Inst.: pattesu

	<p><font>(xviii) The Loc. is used for the
	Ablative: kadal&#299;desu gaje rakkhanti, they keep off the elephants
	from the plantain-trees.</font></p>

	<p><font>(xix) The Loc. is frequently used
	adverbially; at&#299;te, formerly.</font></p>

	<p><font color="#FF0000"><strong>8. The Vocatives</strong></font></p>

	<p><font><strong>602.</strong> The Vocative Case
	does not require any explanations: it is used exactly as in
	English.</font></p>

	<p><font><strong>603.</strong> </font><font
	color="#FF0000"><strong>The Genitive and Locative
	Absolute</strong></font></p>

	<p><font>(i) When a noun or a pronoun in the
	Locative or Genitive is used with a participle in the same case
	as itself, the construction is called, Locative Absolute and
	Genitive Absolute respectively. The Locative Absolute
	construction is met with much more often than the Genitive
	absolute. There is also found, now and then, a Nominative
	Absolute construction, but far less common than the other two.</font></p>

	<p><font>(ii) The Locative, Genitive and
	(sometimes) the Nominative Absolute, may often be translated by
	&quot;when, while, since&quot; and sometimes by
	&quot;although&quot;: tesu vivadantesu bodhisatto cintesi, while
	they were disputing, the Future Buddha thought; suriye
	attha&#7749;gate, when the sun had set, after sunset; gavisu
	duyham&#257;n&#257;su gato, he went when the cows were being
	milked; asaniy&#257; pi s&#299;se patantiy&#257;, although the
	thunderbolt was falling on their head.</font></p>

	<p><font>(iii) sati, the Locative singular of
	santo, Pres. part of the verb atthi, to be, besides having the
	above meanings may also often be translated by &quot;if, such
	being the case&quot;: atthe sati, if there be need: eva</font><font
	size="3">&#7747;</font><font> sati,
	such being the case; payoge sati, when there is occasion. With
	Feminine words, sati is also used, although it should be,
	satiy&#257; (Fem.): pucch&#257;ya sati, if the question be asked;
	ruciy&#257; sati, had he the desire, if he had the wish.</font></p>

	<p><font>(iv) The Genitive Absolute is not quite
	so frequently used as the Loc. Absolute although found often
	enough: s&#257;ku&#7751;akassa gumbato j&#257;la</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> mocentass'eva,
	even while the fowler was disengaging the net from the bush; tesa</font><font
	size="3">&#7747;</font><font>ki&#7735;ant&#257;na</font><font
	size="3">&#7747;</font><font> yeva
	suriyattha&#7749;igatavel&#257; j&#257;t&#257;, while even they were
	sporting, it became dusk.</font></p>

	<p><font>(v) There is also mentioned a so-called
	Nominative Absolute; gacchanto bh&#257;radv&#257;jo so,
	addas&#257; ajjhuta</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> isi</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font>, Bharadvaja having gone he .. etc.,
	y&#257;ym&#257;no mah&#257;r&#257;j&#257;, add&#257;s&#299; tantarena
	ge, as the king was going, he. . . ., etc,<br>
	Remark. The Gen. Absolute is frequently used to show
	&quot;disregard, contempt&quot;, it can then be translated by
	&quot;in spite of, notwithstanding&quot;. For example see above
	(601, v&#299;i).</font></p>

	<p><font><strong>604.</strong> </font><font
	color="#0000FF" size="4"><strong>Syntax of the
	Adjective</strong></font></p>

	<p><font>(i) As has already been said, whenever
	an adjective is not in composition with another word, it must
	agree with the word it qualifies in number, gender and case.</font></p>

	<p><font>(ii) Adjectives in the comparative
	degree require an Ablative: s&#299;la</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> eva sut&#257;
	seyyo, virtue is better than learning.</font></p>

	<p><font>(iii) Comparison is also expressed by an
	Abl. followed by an adjective in the positive degree:<br>
	m&#257;dhur&#257; p&#257;&#7789;aliputtakehi abhirup&#257;, the people
	of Madhura are more handsome than those of P&#257;&#7789;aliputta.</font></p>

	<p><font>(iv) It is also expressed by the
	indeclinable vara</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font>, better, with an Abl.: tato vara</font><font
	size="3">&#7747;</font><font>; better
	than that.</font></p>

	<p><font>(v) When &quot;the better of two&quot;
	is to be expressed, a Gen. is used with the positive degree:<br>
	tumhaka</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> dvinna</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> ko bhaddako of you two who is the better?</font></p>

	<p><font>(vi) Superlative adjectives are used
	with the Gen. or the Loc, for examples see above (601, iv).</font></p>

	<p><font>(vi) </font><font color="#0000FF"
	size="4"><strong>Syntax of Pronouns</strong></font></p>

	<p><font><strong>605.</strong> </font><font
	color="#FF0000"><strong>1. Personal Pronouns</strong></font></p>

	<p><font>(i) The personal pronouns are used much
	in the same way as in English, and do not call for particular
	remarks, except, perhaps, the enclitic forms of aha</font><font
	size="3">&#7747;</font><font> and tva</font><font
	size="3">&#7747;</font><font>; (289-b,
	c; 290, c).</font></p>

	<p><font>(ii) The enclitic forms of aha</font><font
	size="3">&#7747;</font><font>: me and
	no, and those of tva</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font>: te and vo, are never used at the beginning of a
	sentence nor immediately before the particles ca, t&#257; and
	eva: detu me, let him give to me; tava v&#257; me hotu, be it
	thine or mine; kamma</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> no ni&#7789;&#7789;hita</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font>, our task is
	finished; ko te doso, what is thy fault? kaha</font><font
	size="3">&#7747;</font><font> vo
	r&#257;j&#257;, where is your king?</font></p>

	<p><font>(iii) With verbs, the personal pronouns
	are frequently understood, as the endings of the tenses clearly
	indicate also the person as: gacchati (he) goes=so gacchati;
	gaccheyy&#257;mi, (I) should go=aha</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> gaccheyy&#257;mi
	etc.</font></p>

	<p><font>(iv) The personal pronoun so, s&#257;,
	ta</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> is also used as a demonstrative and as an
	article. See Concord (589). Therefore, so puriso may mean
	according to the context: the man, or, that man.</font></p>

	<p><font>(v) Tasm&#257; (abl ), is used
	adverbially in the sense of &quot;therefore accordingly,
	thereby&quot;: with the same meanings it is also followed by hi
	and ti ha (=iti ha): tasm&#257; hi pa&#241;&#241;&#257; ca
	dhanena seyyo, and therefore is wisdom better than riches;
	tasm&#257; ti ha bhikkhave, accordingly, O monks!</font></p>

	<p><font>(vi) The Inst. tena is used with the
	same meanings as tasm&#257;: tena ta</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> madhura</font><font
	size="3">&#7747;</font><font>,
	therefore, on that account, it is sweet. Tena followed by hi
	means &quot;well! very well! all right! well then!&quot; tena hi
	kh&#257;d&#257;pess&#257;mi nan ti, very well, then, I'll make
	you devour him.</font></p>

	<p><font>(vii) Na</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> and ena</font><font
	size="3">&#7747;</font><font> (295,
	300), are used when something or someone already mentioned is
	referred to. See (296).</font></p>

	<p><font><strong>606.</strong> </font><font
	color="#FF0000"><strong>2. Demonstrative Pronouns</strong></font></p>

	<p><font>(i) eso, es&#257;, eta</font><font
	size="3">&#7747;</font><font> (298),
	refer to what is near, and mean: this; es&#257; itth&#299;, this
	woman; nirupak&#257;ro es&#257;, this (fellow) is useless.</font></p>

	<p><font>The same remarks apply to aya</font><font
	size="3">&#7747;</font><font> and asu,
	this.<br>
	Remark. esa is often used for eso, sa for so.</font></p>

	<p><font>(ii) The neuter etad (=eta</font><font
	size="3">&#7747;</font><font>, 302),
	is used with the verb hoti and the Gen. of the person, and the
	expression is then equivalent to &quot;to think&quot;: tassa etad
	ahosi, he thought... (lit=of his this was).</font></p>

	<p><font><strong>607.</strong> </font><font
	color="#FF0000"><strong>3. The Relative</strong></font></p>

	<p><font>(i) We have already explained the
	Relative (592); only a few of its most important peculiar uses
	need be mentioned here:</font></p>

	<p><font>(ii) Yo (311) is used with the
	Indefinite koci (319): yo koci, whoever, anyone; ya</font><font
	size="3">&#7747;</font><font>
	ki&#241;ci, whatsoever, anything. See (314-a, b).</font></p>

	<p><font>(iii) The Neut. Sing. ya</font><font
	size="3">&#7747;</font><font> is
	frequently used adverbially in the sense of &quot;as; that,
	because, since, seeing that, If, when &quot;ta</font><font
	size="3">&#7747;</font><font> bahu</font><font
	size="3">&#7747;</font><font> ya</font><font
	size="3">&#7747;</font><font> pi
	j&#299;vasi, it is much that thou livest.</font></p>

	<p><font>(iv) The Inst. yena is used as an
	adverb, meaning &quot;whereby, by which, for which,
	because&quot;: yena na</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> ga&#7751;hiss&#257;mi, by which I shall catch him.</font></p>

	<p><font>(v) When motion to a definite place is
	expressed, yena, where, is used with tena, there: yena
	bhagav&#257;, ten'upasa&#7749;kati, he went to Buddha (lit. where was
	Buddha there he approached).</font></p>

	<p><font>(vi) Yasm&#257; (Abl.), is used in the
	sense of &quot;because&quot; and is then generally followed by
	tasm&#257;, therefore; yasm&#257; tva</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> na
	j&#257;n&#257;si tasm&#257; b&#257;lo's&#299; ti, because thou doth
	not understand, therefore art thou a fool.</font></p>

	<p><font><strong>608.</strong> </font><font
	color="#FF0000"><strong>4. The Interrogative</strong></font></p>

	<p><font>(i) The interrogative pronoun ko (316),
	may be used by itself or with a noun or pronoun: ko pana tva</font><font
	size="3">&#7747;</font><font>, who art
	thou? ke ete, who are these? k&#257; d&#257;rik&#257;, which
	girl?</font></p>

	<p><font>(ii) kena (Inst.) used with attho and
	the Dat. of the person, forms such expressions as &quot;what do
	you want?&quot; etc,: kena te attho, what are you in need of?</font></p>

	<p><font>(iii) kena (Inst.) kasm&#257; (Abl.) and
	kissa (Gen.) are used adverbially with the meaning of &quot;why?
	wherefore?&quot;</font></p>

	<p><font>(iv) ki</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> is much used with
	the Inst. to express &quot;what is the use of?&quot; ki</font><font
	size="3">&#7747;</font><font> me
	j&#299;vitena, what is the use to me of life?</font></p>

	<p><font color="#FF0000"><strong>5. The
	Indefinite</strong></font></p>

	<p><font><strong>609.</strong> The indefinite
	pronoun (319), does not present any peculiarity: m&#257; idha
	koci p&#257;visi, let nobody enter here; ki&#241;ci bhaya</font><font

	<p><font><strong>610.</strong> To express
	&quot;plurality, totality, distribution, variety,

	size="3">&#7747;</font><font> kathaya

	flight.</font></p>

	<p><font><strong>611.</strong> (viii) </font><font
	color="#0000FF" size="4"><strong>Syntax of Verbs</strong></font></p>

	<p><font>(i) The Concord of the verb with its
	subject has already been noticed (590, 1st).</font></p>

	<p><font>(ii) The Present Tense denotes an action
	taking place now, a fact existing at the present time so
	bh&#257;yati, he is afraid; s&#257; pacati, she cooks.</font></p>

	<p><font>(iii) The present tense often expresses
	the continuance of an action and is equivalent to the present
	progressive: s&#257; gabbhe nis&#299;dati, she is sitting in her
	private room.</font></p>

	<p><font>(iv) Habit, custom and general truths
	are expressed by the present tense sabbe maranti, all (men) die;
	bhikkhu s&#299;la</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> &#257;carati: a monk practises virtue.</font></p>

	<p><font>(v) The present is sometimes used with a
	future signification: ki</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> karomi, what shall I do?</font></p>

	<p><font>(vi) The present is extremely frequent
	in narrations when recounting past events as if they were
	actually happening, this is called the Historical Present: so
	pa&#241;cam&#257;&#7751;avakasat&#257;ni sippa</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font>
	ugga&#7751;h&#257;peti, he taught five hundred young men (lit. he
	teaches).</font></p>

	<p><font>(vii) When no interrogative particle is
	used, interrogation is sometimes expressed by placing the present
	tense at the beginning of the sentence: socasi tva</font><font
	size="3">&#7747;</font><font>
	up&#257;saka, grievest thou, O layman? Remark. Other tenses may
	also be used in the same way to mark interrogation.</font></p>

	<p><font><strong>612.</strong> </font><font
	color="#FF0000"><strong>The Past Tense</strong></font><font><br>
	Perfect, Imperfect and Aorist.</font></p>

	<p><font>(i) The Perfect and the Imperfect tenses
	present no difficulty, they are as a rule used in the sense of a
	general past, and they do not require any notice. Let it be borne
	in mind, however, that the Perfect is but seldom used; that the
	Imperfect, though more frequent than the Perfect, does seldom
	differ from it in meaning and last, that the Aorist has generally
	displaced these two tenses and superseded them.</font></p>

	<p><font>(ii) The Aorist is the principal past
	tense in P&#257;li and is therefore extensively used; it
	expresses indefinite past time, but also includes the Present
	day. The Aorist may be translated by the Present Perfect or the
	Past Indefinite (See 405): catupp&#257;d&#363; pi eka</font><font
	size="3">&#7747;</font><font> s&#299;ha</font><font

	brahmin walked about with the goat.</font></p>

	<p><font>(iii) The indeclinable m&#257; is used
	with the Aorist to express prohibition:<br>
	e&#7735;aka, m&#257; bh&#257;yi, O! goat, fear not! m&#257; puna
	evar&#363;pa</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> ak&#257;si, do not do so again; t&#257;ta,
	m&#257; gami, dear son, do not go.</font></p>

	<p><font><strong>613.</strong> </font><font
	color="#FF0000"><strong>Future Tense</strong></font></p>

	<p><font>(i) The Future expresses simple
	futurity: aha</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> gacchiss&#257;mi, I shall go; te marissanti,
	they will die.</font></p>

	<p><font>(ii) The future is also used as a mild
	form of the Imperative, when courteously giving a command: tva</font><font
	size="3">&#7747;</font><font> tassa
	bandhana</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> dantehi kh&#257;dissasi, cut his bonds with thy
	teeth.</font></p>

	<p><font>(iii) The future is used to express
	simple condition, with the particles ce, sace and yadi: yadi tva</font><font
	size="3">&#7747;</font><font>
	y&#257;gu</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> pacissasi aha</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> piviss&#257;mi,
	if thou wilt cook the gruel, I shall drink it; so ta&#241; ce
	labhissati, tena saddhi</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> gaccha, if he gets it, go with him.</font></p>

	<p><font><strong>614.</strong> </font><font
	color="#FF0000"><strong>The Optative</strong></font></p>

	<p><font>(i) The Optative expresses
	&quot;probability, capability, fitness, assent or permission,
	command, wish, condition&quot; and is also used in laying down
	rules and precepts.</font></p>

	<p><font>(ii) Fitness: tva</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> tattha
	gaccheyy&#257;si, you should go there.</font></p>

	<p><font>(iii) Wish: aha</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> ima</font><font

	<p><font>(v) Probability: api ca n&#257;ma
	gaccheyy&#257;mi, I may go.</font></p>

	<p><font>(vi) When expressing condition, it is
	usually preceded by ce, sace or yadi, if: s&#257;mi, sace
	im&#257;ya vel&#257;ya tava sapatta</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> passeyy&#257;si
	kin ti ta</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> kareyy&#257;si? Lord, if, at this time thou
	should see thy enemy, what would thou do to him?</font></p>

	<p><font>(vii) To express supposition, the word
	yath&#257; is sometimes used with the Optative: yath&#257;
	mah&#257;r&#257;ja kocideva puriso pad&#299;pa</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> pad&#299;peyya, were,

	<p><font>(viii) Assent: tva</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> id&#257;ni
	gaccheyy&#257;si, thou may now go.</font></p>

	<p><font color="#FF0000"><strong>The Conditional</strong></font></p>

	<p><font><strong>615.</strong> The Conditional
	expresses an action unable to be performed on account of some
	impediment in the way of its execution: so ce ta</font><font
	size="3">&#7747;</font><font>
	y&#257;na</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> alabhissa agacchiss&#257;, he would go if he

	this ascetic been walking to and fro at the foot of this tree you
	should all have been completely pillaged.</font></p>

	<p><font><strong>616.</strong> </font><font
	color="#FF0000"><strong>The Imperative</strong></font></p>

	<p><font>(i) The Imperative is used in giving
	commands: tena hi, gaccha, very well, go!</font></p>

	<p><font>(ii) It expresses entreaty: bhante
	bhagav&#257; apposukko viharatu, Lord, let the Blessed One now
	live free from cares.</font></p>

	<p><font>(iii) Benedictions, blessings: vassasata</font><font
	size="3">&#7747;</font><font>, j&#299;va,
	may you live a hundred years!</font></p>

	<p><font>(iv) With m&#257; prefixed, the
	Imperative 2nd person expresses simple prohibition (see Aorist
	612, iii) m&#257; eva</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> karotha, do not do so!</font></p>

	<p><font>(v) The Imperative 3rd person sing. of
	bhavati, to be, is often used idiomatically, with the meaning of
	&quot;very well&quot;: hotu, aha</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> ja&#7751;iss&#257;mi,
	very well I'll see (to it).</font></p>

	<p><font><strong>617.</strong> </font><font
	color="#FF0000"><strong>The Infinitive</strong></font></p>

	<p><font>(i) The Infinitive shows &quot;purpose,
	motive intention&quot;. It is used actively as well as passively.<br>
	&#363;yy&#257;nap&#257;lo cha&#7693;&#7693;etu</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> up&#257;ya</font><font
	size="3">&#7747;</font><font> na
	passati, the gardener saw no means of throwing (them) away;<br>
	ta</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> gantu</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font>, na dass&#257;mi, I will not let him go.</font></p>

	<p><font>(ii) The Infinitive is used with verbs
	meaning &quot;to wish to try or strive, to begin, to be
	able&quot;: s&#257; roditu</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font>, &#257;rabhi, she began to cry; na koci
	may&#257; saddhi</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> sallapitu</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> sakkoti, no one can converse with me; s&#257;
	pavisitu</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> na icchati, she did not wish to enter; so ta</font><font
	size="3">&#7747;</font><font>
	ukkhipitu</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> ussahati, he endeavoured to lift it.</font></p>

	<p><font>(iii) The verb dad&#257;ti to give,
	after an Inf. means &quot;to let, to allow&quot; and the verb
	labhati, to obtain, means &quot;to be allowed&quot;: ta</font><font
	size="3">&#7747;</font><font> paharitu</font><font
	size="3">&#7747;</font><font> na
	dass&#257;mi, I will not allow him to be struck; gehabahi
	nikkhamitu</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> alabhanto, not being allowed to go out of the
	house.</font></p>

	<p><font>(iv) Verbs like va&#7789;&#7789;ati, to behove, to
	be fit, proper, and adjectives like yu&#7789;&#7789;o, having the same
	meaning, are much used with the Inf.; in the case of va&#7789;&#7789;ati,
	the Instrumentive is used of the person who ought to do the act:
	ettha d&#257;ni may&#257; vasitu</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> vattati, it now
	behoves me to live; it is used also impersonally: ta</font><font
	size="3">&#7747;</font><font> haritu</font><font
	size="3">&#7747;</font><font>
	va&#7789;&#7789;ati, the best is to kill him, it is proper, fit, to kill
	him. eva</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> kathetu</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> na yu&#7789;&#7789;a</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font>, it is not proper to speak thus.</font></p>

	<p><font>(v) The indeclinable labbha, possible,
	allowable and sakk&#257;, possible, able, are used wih the Inf.:
	sakk&#257; is used much in the same way as va&#7789;&#7789;ati, that is,
	actively or passively, and often with the Inst. of the person;
	the verb hoti frequently follows sakk&#257;: sakk&#257; hoti
	methuna</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> dhamma</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> pa&#7789;isevitu</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font>, it is possible to practise fornication; etasmi</font><font
	size="3">&#7747;</font><font>
	&#7789;h&#257;ne na sakk&#257; vasitu</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font>, it is impossible
	to live in this place; ida</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> na labbhh&#257; eva</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> katu</font><font
	size="3">&#7747;</font><font>, it is
	not possible to do it in this way.</font></p>

	<p><font>(vi) When k&#257;mo, willing, desirous,
	is compounded with an Inf., final </font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> of the Inf. is
	dropped:<br>
	devat&#257;ya balikamma</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> k&#257;retuk&#257;mo, wishing to make an
	offering to the god.</font></p>

	<p><font><strong>618.</strong> </font><font
	color="#FF0000"><strong>The Gerund</strong></font></p>

	<p><font>(i) The Gerund always denotes an action
	completed before another; it may be translated by the word
	&quot;having&quot; followed by a past participle as: gantv&#257;,
	having gone; or by the past tense followed by the conjunction
	&quot;and&quot; : gantv&#257;, he went and... The gerund,
	therefore, being very extensively used, is the most common
	connective in P&#257;li , and practically does away with the
	P&#257;li conjunction equivalent to the English &quot;and&quot;
	connecting two sentences. so ta</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> ukkhipitv&#257;
	ghara</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> netv&#257; catudh&#257; vibhajitv&#257;
	d&#257;n&#257;d&#299;ni pu&#241;&#241;&#257;ni katv&#257;
	yath&#257;kamma</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> gato, He lifted it up, took it home, divided
	into four parts and, practising alms-giving and other good deeds,
	went according to his deeds.</font></p>

	<p><font>(ii) The word va (=eva) following a
	gerund, may be translated by &quot;as soon as&quot;: ta</font><font
	size="3">&#7747;</font><font> vacana</font><font
	size="3">&#7747;</font><font>
	sutv&#257; va, as soon as he heard these words...; so v&#257;ndro
	attano putta</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> disv&#257; va, the monkey, as soon as he saw his
	offspring...</font></p>

	<p><font>(iii) The particle &quot;api&quot;
	coming after a gerund, may be translated by &quot;although&quot;:
	akata&#241;&#241;&#363; puggalo cakkavattirajja</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> datv&#257; pi
	tosetu</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> na sakk&#257;, an ungrateful man cannot be
	satisfied although he be given universal sovereignty.</font></p>

	<p><font>(iv) Before a gerund, a may be
	translated by &quot;without&quot;: papa&#241;ca</font><font
	size="3">&#7747;</font><font>
	akatv&#257;, without making delays, without any delay; eka</font><font
	size="3">&#7747;</font><font> pi
	akilametv&#257;, without harming even one person.</font></p>

	<p><font>(v) Some gerunds are used
	prepositionally; the principal of them are: patth&#257;ya since,
	beginning from, from, after; sandh&#257;ya, with reference to,
	concerning; &#257;rabbha concerning, with reference to;
	sa&#241;cicca intentionally; asallakkhetv&#257;, inadvertently,
	unawares: niss&#257;ya, upaniss&#257;ya, on account of, through,
	near; &#257;d&#257;ya, with; paticca by, through, on account of;
	&#7789;hapetv&#257;, except, excepting.</font></p>

	<p><font>(vi) The Gerund may sometimes be
	translated by the present participle; idha &#257;gantv&#257; aha</font><font
	size="3">&#7747;</font><font> cora</font><font
	size="3">&#7747;</font><font> passi</font><font
	size="3">&#7747;</font><font>, coming
	here I saw the thief.</font></p>

	<p><font>(vii) The Gerund may have a passive
	signification: coraje&#7789;&#7789;hakena gahetv&#257;, having been seized
	by the robber chief.</font></p>

	<p><font color="#FF0000"><strong>The Participles</strong></font></p>

	<p><font><strong>619.</strong> </font><font
	color="#0000FF"><strong>The Present Participle</strong></font></p>

	<p><font>(i) The Present Participle may generally
	be translated by &quot;while, whilst,&quot; which sense is
	inherent in it; this participle always expresses contemporaneity
	of action: attano g&#257;ma</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> gacchanto cor&#257;&#7789;avi</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> patv&#257;, while
	going to his village he came upon a forest inhabited by thieves;
	tattha gantv&#257; m&#257;tara</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> pa&#7789;ijagganto
	v&#257;sa</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> kappesi, he went and, taking care of his mother,
	took up his abode there.</font></p>

	<p><font>(ii) It must be remembered that
	participles are of the nature of adjectives (439) and must agree
	with the word they qualify in the same way as adjectives:
	av&#299;ciniraya</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> gacchant&#257; satt&#257;..., persons going to
	the Avici Hell; &#257;gacchanta</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> ta</font><font
	size="3">&#7747;</font><font>
	disv&#257; pi, although he saw him coming.</font></p>

	<p><font>(iii) The present participle is
	sometimes used substantively, and may be translated by &quot;he
	who&quot; (does the action expressed by the verb): ida</font><font
	size="3">&#7747;</font><font> pana
	paraloka</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> gacchantassa patheyya</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> bhavissati, but
	this will be provisions for him who goes to the other world:
	paraloka</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> gacchanto eka</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> kah&#257;pa&#7751;a</font><font
	size="3">&#7747;</font><font> pi
	gahetv&#257; na gacchati he who goes to the other world does not
	take even one cent with him.</font></p>

	<p><font>(iv) The present participle may also
	sometimes be translated by a conditional clause: ta</font><font
	size="3">&#7747;</font><font> labhanto
	j&#299;vissami alabhanto idh' eva mariss&#257;mi, if I obtain her I
	shall live; if not, in this very spot shall I die; addham&#257;se
	sahassa</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> labhanto upa&#7789;&#7789;hahiss&#257;mi deva, if I get a
	thousand every fortnight, I'll serve thee, Lord; eva</font><font
	size="3">&#7747;</font><font> karonto
	lacchasi akaronto na lacchasi, if you do so you'll get it, if
	not, you will not get it.</font></p>

	<p><font>(v) The particle pi (=api) following a
	pres. part. may be rendered by &quot;although&quot;: pitar&#257;
	v&#257;riyam&#257;no pi, although prevented by his father; ta</font><font
	size="3">&#7747;</font><font>
	apassanto pi; although not seeing him.</font></p>

	<p><font><strong>620.</strong> </font><font
	color="#0000FF"><strong>2. The Past Participles</strong></font></p>

	<p><font>(i) There are two past participles, the
	Perfect Active (231, 465) and the Passive Perfect (450).</font></p>

	<p><font>(ii) The perfect active participle
	presents no difficulty whatever: so s&#299;ha</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font>
	&#257;dinnav&#257;, he having captured the lion; bhatta</font><font
	size="3">&#7747;</font><font>
	bhutt&#257;v&#299;, having taken his meal.</font></p>

	<p><font>(iii) The passive perfect participle is
	very often used as a predicate instead of a finite verb (See
	Concord of Subject and Predicate 590); it can then be translated
	by a past tense.</font></p>

	<p><font>(iv) The P.P.P. of roots implying
	motion, and of transitive roots, takes an accusative;
	sakaniv&#257;sa</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> eva gato, he went to his own place.</font></p>

	<p><font>(v) When the P.P.P; is thus used
	predicatively, the verb &quot;hoti,&quot; to be, is generally
	understood after it.</font></p>

	<p><font>(vi) The agent of a P.P.P. is as a rule
	put in the Instrumentive case: tay&#257; pa&#241;ha</font><font
	size="3">&#7747;</font><font> pu&#7789;&#7789;ha</font><font
	size="3">&#7747;</font><font>, by her
	the question was asked, she asked the question; s&#257;sana</font><font
	size="3">&#7747;</font><font>
	may&#257; likkhita</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font>, a letter has been written by me, I have etc.</font></p>

	<p><font>(vii) Not seldom the P.P.P. may be
	translated by a pres. participle: tato uppatito vijjullata viya
	vijjotam&#257;no parat&#299;re a&#7789;&#7789;h&#257;si, springing from there,
	he reached the other shore as a lightning flash.</font></p>

	<p><font><strong>621.</strong> </font><font
	color="#0000FF"><strong>3. The Future Participle</strong></font></p>

	<p><font>(i) The future Participle (449) denotes
	that the agent is about to perform the action or undergo the
	state expressed by the root: ra&#7789;&#7789;h&#257; ra&#7789;&#7789;ha</font><font
	size="3">&#7747;</font><font>
	vicarissa</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font>, I am going (= I am about to go) from kingdom to
	kingdom; ta</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> gantha</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> racissa</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> aha</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font>; I am about to compose that book.</font></p>

	<p><font>(ii) It also shows purpose, intention,
	as may be seen by the 2nd example in (i) above.</font></p>

	<p><font>(iii) It shows simple futurity:
	n&#257;ha</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> puna upessa</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> gabbhaseyya</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font>, I shall not be reborn again.</font></p>

	<p><font><strong>622.</strong> </font><font
	color="#0000FF"><strong>4. The Future Passive
	Participle</strong></font></p>

	<p><font>(i) The Future Passive Participle
	conveys the idea of &quot;fitness, necessity, obligation;&quot;
	it denotes that what is expressed by the root is to be, or ought
	to be, or is fit to be or must be done or undergone: may&#257;
	kattabba</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> kamma</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> ni&#7789;&#7789;hita</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> the work which was to be done by me is finished;
	sace so deso ukl&#257;po hoti so deso sammajjitabbo, if the place
	be dirty it ought to be swept; na nav&#257; bhikkh&#363; &#257;sanena
	pa&#7789;ib&#257;hetabb&#257;, young monks should not be ousted from
	their seat.</font></p>

	<p><font>(ii) From the above examples, it will be
	seen that the F.P.P. must agree with the subject in gender, case
	and number.</font></p>

	<p><font>(iii) It is much used impersonally:
	kinnu kattabba</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font>, what is to be done? ettha ca im&#257;ni
	sutt&#257;ni dassetabb&#257;ni, and in this connection these
	passages (from the Scriptures) should be pointed out; imin&#257;
	nayena veditabbo, it must be understood in this way.</font></p>

	<p><font>(iv) It will be, from the above
	examples, remarked, that the agent is put in the Instrumentive.</font></p>

	<p><font>(v) bhavitabba</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font>, used with the
	Inst. of the thing or person, is frequently used in the sense of
	&quot;it must be that, one should or ought to'': majjhatten'eva
	bhavitabba</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font>, one should be indifferent to...;
	visayojit&#257;ya et&#257;ya bhavitabba</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font>, this must have
	been mixed with poison.</font></p>

	<p><font>(v) eva, and, before a vowel yeva is
	used to emphasize the idea expressed by a word, and may be
	translated by &quot;very, just, quite, exactly, as soon as&quot;:
	id&#257;ni eva, just now; attano yeva, one's very own. yeva,
	coming after a verb, is not always easy to translate into

	<p><font><strong>624.</strong> </font><font
	color="#FF0000"><strong>Direct and Indirect
	Narration</strong></font></p>

	<p><font>(i) The oblique construction in
	P&#257;li is expressed by placing the particle iti, so, thus,
	after the words in the direct construction as they would stand in
	English, that is, at the end of the words quoted: kaha</font><font
	size="3">&#7747;</font><font> so
	etarahi ti pucchi, he asked, &quot;Where is he now?&quot;</font></p>

	<p><font>(ii) iti is generally abbreviated to:
	ti, and the last vowel of the quotation, if short, is lengthened
	before it: s&#257;dh&#363; ti, he said &quot;very well!&quot;</font></p>

	<p><font>(iii) Verbs of &quot;saying, telling,
	asking, naming, knowing, thinking,&quot; are generally used with
	iti; those verbs may be:<br>
	(1) Placed after the particle iti: te &quot;s&#257;dh&#363;&quot; ti
	vatv&#257;, they said &quot;Very well.&quot;<br>
	(2) Before the words quoted: so pucchi &quot;ki</font><font
	size="3">&#7747;</font><font>
	j&#257;n&#257;si tvan&quot; ti, he asked &quot;What do you
	know?&quot;<br>
	(3) The verb is frequently omitted altogether:
	m&#257;ress&#257;mi nan&quot; ti, (he thought, or said)
	&quot;I'll kill him!&quot;<br>
	(4) When iti or ti, is followed by a vowel, sandhi takes place
	regularly: iti+eva</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font>=icceva</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font>; kvaci+iti=kvac&#299;ti.<br>
	(5) Often, iti has the sense of &quot;because, with the intention
	of &quot;showing &quot;cause, motive, intention, purpose:&quot;
	&quot;j&#299;vitu</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> asakkont&#257;&quot; ti because (we) are unable
	to make a living; &#7747;akasa</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> pahariss&#257;mi&quot; ti pitu matthaka</font><font
	size="3">&#7747;</font><font>
	dvidh&#257; bhindi, intending to kill the mosquito he broke his
	father's head in two.</font></p>

	<p><font><strong>625.</strong> </font><font
	color="#FF0000"><strong>Interrogation and
	Negation</strong></font></p>

	<p><font>(i) The negative particle is na: imasmi</font><font
	size="3">&#7747;</font><font> sare
	sudaka</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> n'atthi, there is no water in this lake; na

	size="3">&#7747;</font><font> kathetu</font><font
	size="3">&#7747;</font><font> na
	sakkomi, I am unable to speak with the banker.</font></p>

	<p><font>(ii) With an Optative, na is used in
	prohibition: na hatthis&#257;la</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> gaccheyya, let
	him not go to the elephant-shed.</font></p>

	<p><font>(iii) na may form the first part of a
	compound: n&#257;gamana</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> (=na+&#257;gamanam), non-arrival: na bhikkhu, a
	non-monk, a layman.</font></p>

	<p><font>(iv) Two negatives make an affirmative:
	bheri</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> na na v&#257;deyy&#257;, not that he may not
	beat the drum (he may therefore beat it).</font></p>

	<p><font>(v) no, is also used in negation in the
	same way as na: no jan&#257;ti, he does not know.</font></p>

	<p><font>(vi) no, followed by na, expresses a
	strong affirmative: no na dhameyya, he should surely blow (the
	conch); no nappahoti, he is most certainly able.</font></p>

	<p><font>(vii) Interrogation is expressed by
	using interrogative adverbs or pronouns as kasm&#257;, why?
	wherefore? kissa, kena, why? ko, who? etc.</font></p>

	<p><font>(viii) Also by means of interrogative
	particles.</font></p>

	<p><font>(ix) api, when used in interrogation, is
	always placed first in the sentence: ap'avuso, amh&#257;kam
	satth&#257;ra</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> j&#257;n&#257;si, do you, Sir, know our Teacher?</font></p>

	<p><font>(x) followed by nu kho, it expresses a
	very emphatic interrogation: api nu kho koci upaddavo hoti, well,
	have you any cause of distress?</font></p>

	<p><font>(xi) nu, I wonder! Pray? nu, is often
	followed by kho: k&#299;diso nu kho paraloko, I wonder what the next
	world is like? cor&#257; nu atthi, are there thieves?</font></p>

	<p><font>(xii) Preceded by na, it expresses
	emphatic interrogation: na nu'ha</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> yodho, am I not a
	warrior?</font></p>

	<p><font>(xiii) Interrogation is also expressed
	by placing the verb first in the sentence: socasi up&#257;saka,
	grievest thou layman?</font></p>

	<p><font>(xiv) Sometimes the mere tone of voice
	is sufficient to express interrogation: supa</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font> labhi, did thou
	get broth?</font></p>

	<p><font color="#FF0000"><strong>Interjections</strong></font></p>

	<p><font>(i) The principal interjections are:
	h&#257;, alas! ah! handa, come! a&#7749;ga, indeed! oh! bho, friend!
	Sir! I say! hare, sirrah! am&#257;, yes! truly! indeed! aho,
	alas! oh! (538).</font></p>

	<p><font>(ii) bha&#7751;e, first pers. sing.
	Reflective of bha&#7751;ati, to say, is used as an interjection with
	the meaning of &quot;to be sure! I say there!&quot;</font></p>

	<p><font>(iii) ma&#241;&#241;e, 1st. pers. sing.
	Reflective of ma&#241;&#241;ati, to think, is also used as an
	interjection in the sense of &#7747;ethinks! I dare say! I
	suppose!&quot;</font></p>

	<p><font color="#0000FF" size="4"><strong>Short
	and Long Syllables</strong></font></p>

	<p><font><strong>630.</strong> The short vowels
	in P&#257;li are a, i, u, the long vowels are &#257;, &#299;, &#363;, e,
	o. When a, i or u is followed by a double consonant, it is
	prosodically long. For instance, the first as well as the second
	a in cakka&#241;ca, is long because followed by kk and &#241;c
	respectively. Before niggahita (</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font>) a short vowel is
	also always prosodically long. Thus in sacca</font><font size="3">&#7747;</font><font>, the a before </font><font
	size="3">&#7747;</font><font> is long.
	In poetry, a naturally short vowel is occasionally lengthened and
	a naturally long one shortened to meet the exigencies of the
	metre. In order to make a short vowel long, the consonant
	following it is sometimes doubled.</font></p>

	<p><font color="#0000FF" size="4"><strong>Varieties

	called sama; when those in the first and third and those in the
	second and fourth p&#257;das are alike it is addhasama; and when

	<p><font><strong>641.</strong> In the first of
	these, the ariy&#257;, the first two p&#257;das of half a
	g&#257;th&#257; contain seven and a half feet; in the even, that
	is, in the second, fourth, and sixth feet, any of the following,
	namely, ba, ja, sa, g&#257;, or four short syllables may be
	employed, but ja must not be used in the odd feet, that is, in
	the first, third, and fifth. The sixth foot may be la or four
	short syllables. The second-half stanza must fulfil the same
	conditions. It is necessary to observe that in the j&#257;ti
	metre a foot consists of four syllabic instants, the time taken
	up in pronouncing a short syllable being taken as an instant of
	time; thus a long syllable being taken equal to two short ones,
	each foot used in the ariy&#257; is equal to four syllabic
	instants. The following is an illustration of an ariy&#257;

	<p><font><strong>642.</strong> The vet&#257;liya
	is so formed that it usually consists of fourteen syllabic
	instants in the odd quarters and sixteen in the even, while the
	matt&#257;samaka consists of sixteen syllabic instants in each
	quarter. The metres of the j&#257;ti class furnish many
	varieties, but it is not within the scope of this work to treat
	of them in detail. As, however, the vet&#257;liya is of rather
	frequent occurrence, we give below the scheme of it. Each
	p&#257;da is divided into three seats; the first seat in the
	first and third p&#257;das must have six syllabic instants; the
	first seat of the second and fourth p&#257;das must contain eight
	syllabic instants; the second seat must be a cretic foot and the
	third a lambic foot:</font></p>
