        <p class="text">The Lord said to the monks: “Imagine that the whole earth was covered with water, and that a man was to throw a yoke with a hole in it into the water. &#160;Blown by the wind, that yoke would drift north, south, east and west. &#160;Now suppose that once in a hundred years a blind turtle was to rise to the surface. &#160;What would be the chances of that turtle putting his head through the hole in the yoke as he rose to the surface once in a hundred years?” ‘It would be very unlikely, Lord.’ “Well, it is just as unlikely that one will be born as a human being. &#160;It is just as unlikely that a Tathagata, a Noble One, a fully enlightened Buddha, should appear in the world. &#160;And it is just as unlikely that the Dhamma and discipline of the Tathagata should be proclaimed. &#160;But now you have been born as a human being, a Tathagata has appeared and the Dhamma has been proclaimed. &#160;Therefore, strive to realize the Four Noble Truths.”</p>

        <p class="text">Unsurpassed is the Lord’s way of teaching the Dhamma concerning one’s proper moral conduct. &#160;One should be honest and faithful, without deception, chatter, hinting or belittling, not always ready to add gain to gain, but with the sense-doors guarded, moderate in food, a promoter of peace, observant, active and strenuous in effort, a meditator, mindful, with proper conversation, steady-going, resolute and sensible, not hankering after sense pleasures, but mindful and prudent. &#160;This is the unsurpassed teaching concerning a person's proper ethical conduct. &#160;This, the Lord fully comprehends and beyond it nothing lies to be further comprehended. &#160;And in such matters there is no other monk or brahman who is greater or more enlightened than the Lord concerning one's moral conduct.</p>

        <p class="text">If a fool was sitting in an assembly hall, in the main street or at the crossroads and people were to talk about him, and if he were one who broke the Five Precepts, he would think: ‘These people are talking about me because I have done these things.’ This is the first kind of anguish and dejection that the fool experiences here and now. &#160;Again, a fool might see the king arrest a thief or a wrongdoer and punish him. &#160;Upon seeing this, the fool would think: ‘The king is punishing that wrongdoer. &#160;Now, I have done these things also, so if the king were to know about me, he might punish me too.’ This is the second kind of anguish and dejection that the fool experiences here and now. &#160;And further, while the fool is sitting in a chair, lying on a bed or on the ground, those evil deeds that he has previously done with body, speech or mind, come to rest on him, lie on him, settle on him, just as when at evening, the shadows of the great mountains come to rest, lie and settle on the ground. &#160;At such times, the fool thinks: ‘Oh indeed, what is beautiful and skillful has not been done by me. &#160;I have made no refuge against the fearful. &#160;There is a place for those who have not done good but only evil, and to there I will go.’ And so he grieves, mourns, laments, beats his breast, cries and falls into disillusionment. &#160;This is the third kind of anguish and dejection that the fool experiences here and now.</p>

        <p class="text">Four things lead to worldly progress. &#160;What four? &#160;Achievement in alertness, in caution, in good friendship and achievement in balanced livelihood. &#160;And what is achievement in alertness? &#160;Concerning this, in whatever way one earns a living, whether by farming, trading, cattle rearing, archery, service to the king or by some craft, in that one becomes deft and tireless, gifted with an inquiring turn of mind into ways and means, and able to arrange and carry out the job properly.</p>
        <p class="text">And what is achievement in caution? &#160;Concerning this, whatever wealth one acquired by energetic striving, won by strength of arm and sweat of brow, justly and lawfully, one husbands, watches and guards so that kings do not confiscate it, thieves do not steal it, fire or water do not destroy it, and unwanted heirs do not remove it.</p>
        <p class="text">And what is good friendship? &#160;Concerning this, in whatever village or town one lives, one associates with, converses with, discusses things with people either young or old, who are cultured, full of faith, full of virtue, full of charity and full of wisdom. &#160;One acts in accordance with the faith of the faithful, the virtue of the virtuous, the charity of the charitable and the wisdom of the wise.</p>
        <p class="text">And what is balanced livelihood? &#160;Concerning this, one knows both his income and expenditure and lives neither extravagantly nor miserly, knowing that income after expenditure will stand at so much and that expenses will not exceed income. &#160;Just as a goldsmith or his apprentice holding up the scales, knows that it has dipped down by so much or that it has tilted up by so much, one knows one’s income and one’s expenditure. &#160;If one with small income were to lead an extravagant life people would say: ‘He enjoys his wealth like a wood-apple eater.’ Likewise, if one with a good income were to be miserly, people would say: ‘He will die like a beggar.’</p>

        <p class="text">Then Venerable Sariputta said: “There are these five ways of putting away malice that arises. &#160;What five? &#160;Take the case of a person who is impure in deed but not in word. &#160;Suppose a monk who wears rag robes were to see a rag on the road. &#160;He would hold it with his left foot, spread it out with his right foot to see if he could make use of it, and then proceed on his way. &#160;In the same way, one who is impure in deed but not in word, his deed ought to be disregarded. &#160;Think instead about his ways that are pure.</p>
        <p class="text">And concerning one who words are impure but who is pure in deed, how should malice be put away? &#160;Suppose a man, tortured and overcome by heat, exhausted, wearied, craving and thirsty were to come upon a pond overgrown with mossy slime and water plants. &#160;He would dive into the pond, scatter the water plants this way and that, cup his hands, drink, and then go his way refreshed. &#160;In the same way, one whose words are impure but who is pure in deed, his words ought to be disregarded. &#160;Think instead about his ways that are pure.</p>
        <p class="text">And what of one whose words and deed are both impure, but who occasionally attains mental clarity and calm? &#160;Suppose a man, tortured and overcome by heat, exhausted, wearied craving and thirsty, were to come upon a puddle in a cow's footprint. &#160;He might think: ‘If I drink from this puddle using my hands or a cup I will stir up the mud and make it unfit to drink. &#160;I will crouch down on all fours, bend low and drink, as does a cow?’ Then he does this. &#160;In the same way, one whose word and deed are both impure but who occasionally attains mental clarity and calm from time to time, his words and deeds ought to be disregarded. &#160;Think only of his clarity and calm.</p>
        <p class="text">And what of one whose words and deeds are both impure and who cannot even occasionally attain mental clarity and calm? &#160;Suppose a sick ailing and grievously ill man was going along a highway with no village in front or behind, unable to get proper food, medicine or attention, or even a guide to the next village. &#160;If another man were to see him, he might feel pity and he might say to himself: ‘This poor man! &#160;He should get help or he will suffer to his detriment.’ In the same way, for one whose ways are impure and who cannot even occasionally attain mental clarity and calm, pity, compassion and commiseration ought to arise and you should think: ‘This poor man! &#160;He should give up the bad and develop the good, or else after death he will have a bad rebirth.’</p>
        <p class="text">And concerning one whose words and deeds are both pure and who has mental clarity and calm, how should malice be put away? &#160;Suppose a man, tortured and overcome by heat, wearied, craving and thirsty were to come upon a pool of sweet, cool, limpid water, a lovely resting place shaded by all kinds of trees. &#160;He would dive into the pond, bathe, drink and then come out and lie in the shade. &#160;In the same way, of this person, think about this person’s pure words, deeds and his mental clarity and calm.”</p>

          Suppose an enemy has hurt you.
          <br/>
          That is his business.
          <br/>
          Why should you annoy yourself
          <br/>
          And hurt your mind, which is your business?
          <br/>
          <br/>

          <br/>
          This anger which you embrace
          <br/>
          Eats away at the very roots
          <br/>
          Of all the virtues you strive to develop.
          <br/>
          Who would be such a fool?
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Someone else does evil deeds
          <br/>
          And you get angry. &#160;But why?
          <br/>
          Do you wish to copy him
          <br/>
          And act as he does?
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Suppose to annoy someone,
          <br/>
          Provokes you to do something evil.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
          Why allow anger to arise and thereby
          <br/>
          Do exactly what he wants you to do?
          <br/>
          <br/>
          If you get angry
          <br/>
          Then maybe he will suffer, maybe not.
          <br/>
          But by being angry yourself
          <br/>
          You certainly will suffer.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          If enemies blinded by anger
          <br/>
          Are content to walk the path of woe,
          <br/>
          Why should you follow them
          <br/>
          By getting angry yourself?
          <br/>
          <br/>
          If a foe provokes you
          <br/>
          To hurt yourself by getting angry,
          <br/>
          Let that anger subside.
          <br/>
          Do not harm yourself needlessly.

        <p class="text">One who is serious is a believer, not an unbeliever. &#160;One who is serious is energetic, not lazy, of steady not distracted mindfulness, of clear not confused comprehension and with strong wisdom, not weak wisdom. &#160;When you have established these five things in yourself, you should also make six other things grow within you. &#160;You should recollect the Tathagata like this: ‘Such indeed is the Lord, a Noble One, a fully enlightened Buddha, with perfect knowledge and conduct, happily attained, a knower of the worlds, a guide unsurpassed of those to be trained, a teacher of gods and humans, a Buddha, the Lord.’</p>
        <p class="text">You should recollect the Dhamma like this: ‘Beautifully taught is the Lord’s Dhamma, immediately apparent, timeless, of the nature of a personal invitation, progressive, to be attained by the wise, each for themselves.’</p>
        <p class="text">You should recollect the Sangha like this: ‘Happily and straightly faring are the Lord’s disciples, correctly and methodically faring are the Lord’s disciples, namely, the four pairs of individuals, the eight types of persons. &#160;These disciples of the Lord are worthy of offerings, of hospitality, of gifts and salutation with folded hands; they are an incomparable source of goodness in the world.’</p>
        <p class="text">You should recollect your own virtues as being complete, whole, unspotted, untarnished, freedom-giving, as being praised by the wise, pure and leading to concentration.</p>
        <p class="text">You should recollect your own generosity like this: ‘It is a gain for me. &#160;Indeed, it is a great gain, that amidst those overcome by meanness, I live at home with the mind cleansed of meanness. &#160;I am open-handed, pure-handed, delighting in sharing, one to ask a favour of, one who rejoices in giving.’</p>
        <p class="text">Further, you should recollect the gods in this way: ‘There are the gods of the Four Great Kings, the Thirty-three Gods, the gods of Yama, the gods of delight, the gods who delight in creation, those who have power over the creations of others, those in the company of Brahma and those beyond that. &#160;I, too, have the faith, the virtue, the learning, the generosity, and the wisdom by which these gods, on dying here, were reborn there in heaven.’</p>
        <p class="text">At a time when a noble disciple recollects all these things, his mind is free from greed, hatred and delusion. &#160;At that time, his mind is straight and fixed upon those things, and with a straight mind he expresses the gladness of the good, the gladness of the Dhamma, and the gladness that goes with Dhamma. &#160;In one like this gladness arises, from gladness comes joy, because of joy the body is tranquil, with a tranquil body one is happy, and the mind of one who is happy becomes concentrated. &#160;This is said of a person like this: ‘The noble disciple who recollects the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha, who recollects virtue, generosity and the gods – that disciple walks evenly among those who dwell unevenly.’</p>

        <p class="text">The Lord asked, Asibandhakaputta, a follower of Nigantha Nataputta: “What doctrine does Nigantha Nataputta teach his disciples?”</p>
        <p class="text">“Lord, Nataputta teaches that whoever kills, steals, commits sexual misconduct or lies – that person goes to hell. &#160;According to how one habitually acts, one goes to one’s destiny.”</p>
        <p class="text">“But if you say that as one acts habitually one goes to one's destiny, then according to Nataputta’s teaching, no one would go to hell. &#160;What do you think about this? &#160;If a man say, kills by day or night or from time to time, which time is the most habitual to him? &#160;When he kills or when he is not killing?”</p>
        <p class="text">“Well, Lord, the time when he is not killing is most habitual to him.”</p>
        <p class="text">“Now, say a teacher teaches a doctrine such as this and a follower has faith in such a teacher. &#160;That follower would think: ‘My teacher says that whoever kills, steals, commit sexual misconduct or lies goes to hell. &#160;Now I have done these things so I will to go to hell.’ And so, holding this view, not giving it up, thinking about it, ruminating over it, he does go to hell. &#160;But say a Tathagata arises in the world. &#160;He censures, strongly censures, killing, stealing, sexual misconduct and lying, saying: ‘Abstain from these things.’ Then say a follower has faith in such a teacher, that follower would think: ‘The Lord in many ways censures, strongly censures, killing, stealing, sexual misconduct and lying, saying: Abstain from these things. &#160;Now I have done such things. &#160;That is not well done, it is not good. &#160;Moreover, I may be remorseful when I remember that such deeds cannot be undone.’ Thinking in this way, he abandons such deeds. &#160;In this way he goes beyond evil deeds. &#160;By abandoning killing, he abstains from killing, by abandoning stealing, sexual misconduct, lying, backbiting, harsh speech, and idle chatter he abstains from all these things. &#160;By abandoning greed, he becomes generous, by abandoning hatred he becomes kind, and by abandoning wrong view he becomes one with perfect view. &#160;This noble disciple, freed from greed and hatred, not bewildered but mindful and concentrated, abides suffusing the four quarters of the world, above, below, across, everywhere, all beings, the whole world with a mind filled with love, compassion, sympathetic joy and equanimity that is widespread, grown great. &#160;Just as a strong conch blower with but little effort gives notice to the four quarters, in the same way, nothing whatsoever is left out of that love, that compassion, that sympathetic joy or that equanimity.”</p>

        <p class="text">There are four kinds of good-hearted people who should be known as true friends; the helper, the consistent friend, one who gives good counsel, and one who sympathizes. &#160;The helper is a true friend for four reasons. &#160;He guards you when you are off your guard, he guards your property when you are off your guard, he comforts you when you are afraid, and when something has to be done, he gives you twice what you require. &#160;The consistent friend is a true friend for four reasons. &#160;He tells you his secrets, he keeps the secrets you tell him, in trouble he does not forsake you, and he would even lay down his life for you. &#160;The friend who gives good counsel is a true friend for four reasons. &#160;He discourages you from doing wrong, he encourages you to do good, he tells you things you have not heard, and he points out the way to heaven. &#160;The friend who sympathizes is a true friend for four reasons. &#160;He is sad at your misfortunes, he rejoices at your good fortune, he restrains others from speaking ill of you, and he commends those who speak well of you.</p>

          Once, the Lord was staying near Vesali, at the Gabled Hall in the great forest. &#160;And at that time, the brahmin Karanapalin constructed a building for the Licchavis. &#160;And Karanapalin saw the brahmin Pingiyanin coming in the distance, and as he approached, he said: “Pray, now, from where comes your honour Pingiyanin so early in the day?”

          “But what good do you see in him that you have such faith in him?”
          <br/>
          “Just as when a man is completely satisfied with some delicious flavour, and longs not for other flavours that are poor – even so, when one hears the good Gotama’s Dhamma in all its parts, one longs not for the talk of others, the crowd, other recluses or Brahmins. &#160;Just as a man overcome by hunger and weakness may come across a honey cake, and whenever he tastes it, he enjoys the sweet, delicious flavour – even so, when one hears the good Gotama’s Dhamma in all its parts, one experiences sweetness and serenity of mind. &#160;Just as a man may come across a stick of yellow or red sandalwood, and wherever he smells it, at the root, in the middle or at the top, he comes across an exceedingly fair, delicious fragrance – even so, when one hears the good Gotama’s Dhamma in all its parts, all grief, sorrow, suffering, lamentation and despair just vanish away. &#160;Just as a man tortured by heat, overcome by heat, wearied, craving and thirsty, might come to a pool of clear, sweet, cool, limpid water, a lovely resting place, and might plunge in, bathe, drink, and allay all woe, fatigue and fretting – even so, when one hears the good Gotama’s Dhamma in all its parts, all woe, fatigue and fretting is wholly allayed.”

        <p class="text">When he had said this, the Brahmin Karanapalin arose from his seat, arranged his upper robe on his shoulder, set his right knee on the ground and bending forth his outstretched hands towards where the Lord was, said three times: “Homage to the Lord, the Noble One, the fully enlightened Buddha. &#160;Wonderful is it, Pingiyanin, truly wonderful. &#160;Just as if one had set upright a thing toppled over, revealed something covered, showed a blind man the way, brought a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could see – in the same way, you have illuminated this Dhamma in many a way. &#160;I too will go to the good Gotama, the Dhamma and the Sangha as my refuge. &#160;Look upon me as a lay disciple gone for refuge from now until as long as life lasts.”</p>

        <p class="text">“But Malunkyaputta, did I ever say to you: ‘Come, be my disciple, and I will answer all these questions for you?’ ”</p>
        <p class="text">“No, sir.”</p>
        <p class="text">“Then, did you ever say to me: ‘I will become your disciple only if you answer all these questions?’ ”</p>
        <p class="text">“No, sir.”</p>
        <p class="text">“So, who are you and what is your complaint, you foolish man? &#160;If one were to say that they would not become my disciple until all these views had been explained by me, he might be dead before it could be done. &#160;It is as if a man had been shot by a poisoned arrow and his friends might get a doctor to help him. &#160;And he might say: ‘Wait! &#160;I do not want the arrow removed until I know the name of the man who shot it, what caste he is, whether he is short or tall, fat or thin. &#160;I do not want the arrow removed until I know whether the bow that shot the arrow was a spring bow, a crossbow or a longbow. &#160;I do not want the arrow removed until I know whether the bow was made from reed, wood or bamboo, or whether the head of the arrow was a calf-tooth head, an ordinary head, a jagged head or an iron head.’ Long before all these questions could be answered, that man would be dead. &#160;In the same way, if someone were to say that they would not become my disciple until all the questions about whether the world is infinite or not were answered, they might be dead before it could be done. &#160;Living the holy life could not be said to depend upon whether the world is infinite or not, whether it is both infinite and finite, whether it is neither infinite nor finite or any of the other questions. &#160;Whether the world is infinite or not, there is birth, there is aging, there is dying, there is grief, sorrow, suffering, lamentation and despair, and it is for the ending of this that I teach. &#160;Therefore, understand as not explained what has not been explained by me, and understand as explained what has been explained by me. &#160;And what has not been explained by me? &#160;All these speculative views that you ask about. &#160;And why? &#160;Because it is not connected with the goal, it is not fundamental to the holy life, it does not conduce to good, to turning away, to fading, to calming, to higher knowledge or to Nirvana. &#160;And what has been explained by me? &#160;The Four Noble Truths. &#160;And why? &#160;Because it is connected with the goal, it is fundamental to the holy life, it does conduce to good, to turning away, to fading, to calming, to higher knowledge and to Nirvana.”</p>

        <p class="text">What is the power of sympathy? &#160;There are these four bases of sympathy: generosity, kind speech, doing a good turn and treating all equally. &#160;The best generosity is generosity with the Dhamma. &#160;The best kind speech is teaching the Dhamma again and again to a good and attentive listener. &#160;The best good turn is inciting, encouraging and establishing the ways of faith in the doubting, the ways of virtue in the unvirtuous, the ways of generosity in the mean, and ways of wisdom in the foolish. &#160;The best equal treatment is the equality between Stream-Winner and Stream-Winner, between Once-Returner and Once-Returner, between Non-Returner and Non-Returner, and between Noble One and Noble One. &#160;This is called the power of sympathy.</p>

          Venerable Sona, meditating in solitude, thought to himself: “The Lord’s disciples live in energy and I am one of them, and yet my mind is not detached and free from the defilements. &#160;My family is rich so I am going to give up the training, return to the household life, enjoy riches and do good works.” Now, the Lord read Sona’s mind, and as easily as a strong man might stretch out his arm, he appeared in front of Sona and said: “What do you think, Sona? &#160;In the past when you were at home, were you not accomplished in the lute's music?”

          Then, King Milinda said to Venerable Nagasena: “What is the characteristic of faith?”
          <br/>
          “Faith, Sir, has the characteristic of tranquility and leaping forward.”
          <br/>
          “In what way is tranquility a characteristic of faith?”
          <br/>
          “When faith arises, it destroys the hindrances, and when thought is without the hindrances, it is clear, pure and serene.”
          <br/>
          “Give me a simile.”
          <br/>
          “A king, going along a highway together with his army of four parts – elephants, cavalry, chariots and infantry – might cross a small stream, and the water might become dirty, turbid and muddy by being disturbed by the army. &#160;Then, the king might say: ‘Bring water, good sirs, I want to drink.’ They might answer him, saying: ‘Yes, your Majesty,’ and taking the king's water-cleansing gem might put it in the water so that the various water plants would disappear, the mud subside and the water become clear, pure and serene. &#160;Then they would offer the water to the king, saying: ‘Let His Majesty drink.’
          <br/>
          Thought is like the water, the people are like the earnest students of meditation, the defilements are like the water plants and mud, and faith is like the water-cleansing gem. &#160;As the water plants disappear, the mud subsides, and the water become clear, pure and serene when the water-cleansing gem is put in it – even so, the arising of faith destroys the hindrances and thought without hindrances is clear, pure and serene.”
        </p>
        <p class="text">“How, reverend sir, is leaping forward a characteristic of faith?”</p>
        <p class="text">
          “As, Sir, the earnest student of meditation, on seeing that the minds of others are freed, leaps forward after the fruits of Stream-Winning, of Once-Returning, of Non-Returning or of Arahantship, and practices meditation for the attainment of the unattained, for the mastery of the unmastered, for the realization of the unrealized. &#160;In this way is leaping forward a characteristic of faith.”
          <br/>
          “Give me a simile.”
          <br/>
          “A great rain cloud might pour down rain on a high mountain, so that the water rushing down the incline, after filling the gullies, the valleys and the small streams on the slopes, would fill the river, so that it would rush along, breaking its banks. &#160;Now, if a great crowd of people were to approach that river knowing neither its width nor depth, they would stand terrified and hesitant on its bank. &#160;Then, if a man were to approach who was confident of his own power and strength, and putting on a loincloth, were to dive into that river he would cross over. &#160;The other people, seeing that he had crossed over, would then cross over, too. &#160;Even so, Sir, the earnest student of meditation, on seeing that the minds of others are freed, leaps forward after the fruits of Stream-Winning, of Once-Returning or of Arhantship, and practices meditation for the attainment of the unattained, for the mastery of the unmastered, for the realization of the unrealized, and thus is leaping forward a characteristic of faith.”

          The Lord said to Lohicca: “Is it true that you think like this: ‘If a monk or brahmin discovers some important truth, he should not teach it to others. &#160;For what can one person do for another? &#160;It is just as if, having cut through an old bond, one were to make a new bond. &#160;Such a thing is an evil action rooted in attachment. &#160;For what can one person do for another?’ ”

        <p class="text">In due time Kisa Gotami became pregnant and after ten lunar months she gave birth to a son. &#160;But the child died as soon as he was able to walk. &#160;Kisa Gotami had not known death before and when they came to remove the child's body for cremation, she refused to let them do so, saying to herself: “I will get medicine for my son.” Placing the dead child on her hip, she went from house to house, pleading: “Do you know a cure for my son?” Everyone said to her: “Woman, you are completely mad in seeking medicine for your son,” but she went away, thinking: “Truly, I will find someone who knows the right medicine for my child.” Now a certain wise man saw her and thought to himself: “I must help her.” So he said: “Woman, I do not know if there is a cure for your child, but there is one who will know and I know him.”</p>
        <p class="text">“Sir, who is it who will know?”</p>
        <p class="text">“Woman, the Lord will know. &#160;Go and ask him.”</p>
        <p class="text">So, she went to the Lord, paid reverence to him, stood at one side and asked: “Venerable sir, is it true as people say that you will know a cure for my child?”</p>
        <p class="text">“Yes, I know.”</p>
        <p class="text">“What then do I need?”</p>
        <p class="text">“A few mustard seeds.”</p>
        <p class="text">“I will get them, Venerable sir, but in whose house?”</p>
        <p class="text">“Get them from a house where no son or daughter or any other person has ever died.”</p>
        <p class="text">
          “Very well, sir,” Kisa Gotami said, and having paid reverence to the Lord, and having placed the dead child on her hip, she went to the village and stopped at the very first house.
          <br/>
          “Have you any mustard seeds? &#160;They say they will cure my child.” They gave her the seeds, and then she asked: “Friend, has any son or daughter died in this house?”
          <br/>
          “What do you ask, woman? &#160;The living are few and the dead are many.” “Then take back your seeds, for they will not cure my child,” she said, and returned the seeds they had given her. &#160;In this way she went from house to house but never did she find one that had the mustard seeds that she needed. &#160;Then she thought: “Oh! &#160;It is a difficult task that I have. &#160;I thought it was only I who had lost a child, but in every village the dead are more than the living.” While she reflected thus, her heart which had trembled now become still.

        <p class="text">In the same way, as long as the five hindrances are not given up, one feels indebted, sick, imprisoned, enslaved, lost in the wilderness. &#160;But when the five hindrances are given up, one feels free from debt, healthy, free, emancipated and safe. &#160;And when one knows that these five hindrances are given up, gladness arises, from gladness comes joy, because of joy the body is tranquil, with a tranquil body one is happy, and the mind of one who is happy becomes concentrated.</p>

          “There is Brahma who is all-powerful, none are more powerful, all seeing, with great power and dominion. &#160;To see Brahma is the highest of sights. &#160;There are the gods of radiant splendor in whom joy flows and overflows and who utter a cry of ‘Joy! &#160;Oh joy!’ To hear this is the highest of sounds. &#160;There are the all-lustrous gods who feel joy but who rejoice in silence, and this is the highest of joys. &#160;There are the gods who go to the sphere of nothingness, and this is the highest of conscious states. &#160;Then there are the gods who go to the sphere of neither-consciousness-nor-unconsciousness, and this is the highest state of being.”

        <p class="text">Then Ananda thought: “Uttiya must not be allowed to think that the Lord cannot answer this all-important question.” So Ananda said: "I will give you a simile Uttiya. &#160;Imagine a walled town with strong foundation and towers and a single gate. &#160;At the gate a watcher who is clever and alert who lets in known people and keeps out strangers. &#160;As he patrols the walls he would not see a hole in the wall big enough for even a cat to slip through. &#160;And therefore he would know that whatever creatures big or small enter or leave the town, they all do so by the gate. &#160;It is the same with the answer to your question, a question that is not important to the Lord. &#160;What the Lord says is this. &#160;Whoever has escaped, is escaping or will escape from the world, they will do it by abandoning the five hindrances, those defilements of the mind that weaken wisdom; they will do it with mind well-established in the four foundations of mindfulness, and by developing the seven factors of enlightenment.”</p>

        <p class="text">The Lord said: “Suppose people were to flock together, crying: ‘The fairest girl in all the land. &#160;The fairest in the land!’ That girl, displaying all her charms, would dance and sing for them and even more people would gather. &#160;Then suppose a man came along, fond of life, not liking death, fond of happiness, averse to pain, and they were to say to him: ‘Here’s a bowl full of oil. &#160;You must carry it through the crowd. &#160;A man will come behind you with an uplifted sword and if you spill a drop of oil he will chop off your head.’ Now, what do you think? &#160;Would that man become inattentive and pay attention to what was going on around him rather than to the bowl?’</p>
        <p class="text">“Surely not, Lord.”</p>
        <p class="text">“Well, this is an analogy I have made for your understanding and this is what it means. &#160;The bowl brimful of oil is a term for mindfulness of the body. &#160;So, this is how you should train yourself: ‘We shall cultivate mindfulness of the body, we shall make much of it, make it a vehicle, establish it, make it effective.It shall be increased and well applied’ ”</p>

          When the night was fading, Rohitassa, a son of the gods, came to see the Lord, lighting up all the Jeta Grove with a surpassing brilliance, and saluting him stood to one side and asked: “Lord, is it possible by going far to know, to see, to reach the end of the world, that is, where there is no more being born, growing old and dying, no more trudging on from one existence to another?”
          <br/>
          “I say that the end of the world cannot be known, seen or reached by going.”
          <br/>
          “Wonderful! &#160;Marvelous! &#160;This is well said by the Lord. &#160;In my last life I was a sage named Rohitassa, son of Bhoja. &#160;I had such psychic power that I could walk in the sky and my speed was such that I could go faster than an arrow. &#160;The extent of my stride was the distance between the east and west ocean. &#160;And I thought to myself: ‘I am going to reach the end of the world.’ Except for time spent eating, drinking and answering the call of nature, except for struggles to shake off sleep and weariness, though I lived and traveled for a hundred years, I never reached the end of the world. &#160;I died trying.”
        </p>
        <p class="text">Then the Lord said: “I say that the ending of suffering cannot be found without going to the end of the world. &#160;And within this fathom-high body with its perceptions and thoughts is the world, the origin of the world, the ending of the world and the practice leading to the end of the world.”</p>

        <p class="text">It is said that the Sakyans and the Koliyans dammed the waters of the Rohini River between Kapilavatthu and Koliya and cultivated the fields on both sides of the river. &#160;During the month of Jetthamula, the crops began to wilt, and the workers employed by both cities assembled. &#160;Those of Koliya said: “If the water is diverted to both sides of the river there will not be enough for both of us. &#160;As our crops will ripen with a single watering, let us have the water.” But the Sakyans replied: “After your granaries are full, we will not be able to face taking our valuables and with basket and bags in hand, go begging from your doors. &#160;Our crops will ripen with a single watering, so let us have the water.”</p>
        <p class="text">“We will not give it to you.”</p>
        <p class="text">“And we will not let you have it.”</p>
        <p class="text">Talk grew bitter, one person struck another, the blow was returned, fighting broke out, and as they fought they cast aspersions upon the origin of the each other’s royal families. &#160;The Koliyans workers said: “Take your brats and go where you belong. &#160;How can we be harmed by the elephants, horses, shields and weapons of those have slept with their own sisters like dogs and jackals?” The Sakyan workers replied: “You lepers, take your brats and go where you belong. &#160;How can we be harmed by the elephants, horses, shields and weapons of miserable outcasts who live up jujube trees like animals.” Both groups went and reported the quarrel to the ministers who were in charge of the work, who in turn reported it to the royal households. &#160;The Sakyans prepared for battle, saying: “We will show them the strength and power of those who have slept with their sisters.” The Koliyans prepared for battle, saying: "We will show them the strength and power of those who live up jujube trees.”</p>
        <p class="text">As the Lord surveyed the world at dawn he saw his kinsmen and thought: “If I do not go, these people will destroy each other. &#160;It is my duty to go to them.” He passed through the air to where his kinsmen were gathered, and seated himself cross-legged in the air in the middle of the Rohini River. &#160;When the Lord’s kinsmen saw him they put down their weapons and worshipped him. &#160;Then the Lord said: “What is this quarrel about, great king?”</p>
        <p class="text">“We know not, reverend sir.”</p>
        <p class="text">“Then who would know?”</p>
        <p class="text">“The commander-in-chief of the army will know.”</p>
        <p class="text">When asked, the commander-in-chief suggested the viceroy might know. &#160;Thus the Lord asked one after the other with none of them knowing the cause of the quarrel, until the workers were asked. &#160;They replied: “The quarrel is about the water.”</p>
        <p class="text">Then the Lord said to the king: “What is the value of water, great king?”</p>
        <p class="text">“Very little, reverend sir.”</p>
        <p class="text">“What is the value of a warrior?”</p>
        <p class="text">“A warrior, reverend sir, is beyond price.” Then the Lord said: “Then is it right that for a little water you should kill warriors who are beyond price?”</p>
        <p class="text">They were all silent. &#160;Then the Lord said: “Great kings, why do you act thus? &#160;Were I not here today, you would cause a river of blood to flow. &#160;Your actions are unworthy. &#160;You live in hatred, given to the five kinds of hatred. &#160;I live full of love. &#160;You live sick with passions. &#160;I live free from sickness. &#160;You live chasing after the five kinds of sense pleasures. &#160;I live in contentment.”</p>

          <br/>
          Still not satisfied, he goes to another man who has seen a kimsuka tree and puts his question to him. &#160;And the other man answers: ‘A kimsuka tree has no bark and its seed pods burst something like an acacia tree.’ So, for the time being, the tree is to him as the other man sees it. &#160;Still dissatisfied, he goes to another man who has seen a kimsuka tree and puts his question yet again. &#160;And that man answers: ‘Well, a kimsuka has thick leaves and gives close shade something like a banyan tree.’ So, for the time being, the tree is to him as the other man sees it. &#160;All these good folks have given their explanations according to the clarity of their understanding. &#160;In the same way, the understanding of the monks you have asked has been purified according to their individual inclinations and they have given their explanations accordingly.”

        <p class="text">
          “O elephant, do not strike a truly great being,
          <br/>
          For to do so is painful indeed.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          For one who slays a great being, O elephant,
          <br/>
          There is no good rebirth, when one departs from here.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Be not proud, be not reckless,
          <br/>
          Or there will be no good rebirth.
          <br/>
          Act in such a way as to have a good rebirth.”
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Then Nalagiri took dust from the Lord’s feet with his trunk, sprinkled it over his own head, and then backed away, bowing, and keeping his gaze on the Lord. &#160;He returned to the stable and stood in his own place, and in this way was finally tamed. &#160;Then people at that time sang this verse:
          <br/>
          <br/>
          “Some are tamed by sticks, by goads or by whips.
          <br/>
          The elephant was tamed by the great seer,
          <br/>
          Without stick or weapon.”
          <br/>
          <br/>
          People disparaged and criticized Devadatta widely, saying: “This Devadatta is evil and inauspicious in that he tried to murder the monk Gotama who is of such great psychic power and majesty.” And Devadatta's reputation declined while the Lord’s grew.

        <p class="text">The Lord said: “That is what the world says Kassapa. &#160;But if a naked ascetic was to practice all kinds of self- mortification, and if this was the measure of difficulty, then it would not be true to say that it is hard to be a true ascetic or a true brahmin. &#160;Because anyone, a householder, his son, even a slave girl who draws water, could go naked and practice self-mortification. &#160;But there is another type of asceticism about which it is true to say that it is hard to be a true ascetic, a true brahmin. &#160;When a monk develops a mind free from hatred or ill-will, full of love, and by the destruction of the defilements, dwells with a mind freed through insight, then that monk is a true ascetic, a true brahman.”</p>

        <p class="text">It is just as if a man traveling in a forest should come across an ancient road, an ancient path, traversed by people in former times. &#160;Proceeding along it, he comes to an ancient city, an old royal citadel, lived in by people in former times, with parks and groves, water tanks and walls; a truly delightful place. &#160;Then, suppose that this man should tell of his discovery to the king or a royal minister, saying: ‘Sire, you should know that I have discovered an ancient city. &#160;You should restore that place.’ Then, suppose that ancient city was restored, so that it became prosperous, flourishing, populous and was filled with folk, and it grew and expanded. &#160;In the same way, I have seen an ancient road, an ancient path, traversed by the fully enlightened Buddhas of former times. &#160;And what is that path? &#160;It is the Noble Eightfold Path.</p>

          How does one live practicing contemplation of mind? &#160;Concerning this, one knows a mind with greed as a mind with greed, and a mind without greed as a mind without greed. &#160;One knows a mind with hatred as a mind with hatred, and a mind without hatred as a mind without hatred. &#160;One knows a mind with delusion as a mind with delusion, and a mind without delusion as a mind without delusion. &#160;One knows the contracted mind as contracted and the distracted mind as distracted, the developed mind as developed and the undeveloped mind as undeveloped. &#160;One knows the mind with some mental state superior to it as the mind with some mental state superior to it, and the mind with no mental state superior to it as the mind with no mental state superior to it. &#160;One knows the concentrated mind as concentrated and the unconcentrated mind as unconcentrated, the mind that is freed as freed and the mind that is not freed as not freed.
          <br/>
          Thus one dwells contemplating mind internally and externally. &#160;One dwells contemplating the origination factors and the dissolution factors in the mind, or one's mindfulness that "there is mind" is established to the extent necessary for knowledge and mindfulness. &#160;Independent one dwells, clinging to nothing in the world.

        <p class="text">“Reverend Sir, some food remains untouched.”</p>

        <p class="text">“That is true, Lord.”</p>
        <p class="text">“Now concerning this, what do you think, Tissa? &#160;If one is not free from lust, desire, affection, thirst, fever and craving, then when the body alters and changes do not grief, sorrow, suffering, lamentation and despair arise?”</p>

        <p class="text">An enlightened person is naturally endowed with a compassionate nature and disposition. &#160;He desires to alleviate the suffering that beings suffer, and is even willing to relinquish his own body or life to do so. &#160;Until he reaches his goal, he is willing to struggle and strive for a very long time on a course involving great hardship, without fear and without ever becoming disenchanted with all the suffering in the round of existence, all for the sake of the welfare of other beings.</p>

        <p class="text">There are three urgent duties of a farmer. &#160;What three? &#160;The farmer gets his fields well ploughed and harrowed quickly. &#160;Then he plants the seed quickly. &#160;Then he irrigates the field quickly. &#160;But the farmer has no magic power or authority to say: ‘Let my crops spring up today, let them ear tomorrow and on the following day let them ripen.’ No! &#160;In due time this will happen.</p>
        <p class="text">In the same way, there are these three urgent duties of a monk. &#160;What three? &#160;Undertaking the training in higher virtue, higher thought and higher wisdom. &#160;But he has no such magic power or authority to say: ‘Today, tomorrow or the next day, let my mind be free from the defilements.’ No! &#160;In due time this will happen as he undergoes training in these three things. &#160;Therefore, you should train yourselves like this: ‘We shall be keen to undertake the training in these three things.’ ”</p>

        <p class="text">At that time, a certain monk named Thera was living alone and commending such a life. &#160;He entered the village alone, he returned alone, he sat alone and walked alone. &#160;So a number of other monks went and told the Lord this, and he asked them to call Thera into his presence. &#160;When he came, the Lord asked him: “Is it true as they say that you are living quite alone and that you commend such a life?”</p>
        <p class="text">“That is so, Lord.”</p>
        <p class="text">“In what way do you live and commend?”</p>
        <p class="text">“I enter the village alone, I return alone, I sit alone and walk alone.”</p>
        <p class="text">“That is living alone, it is true, Thera. &#160;But I will tell you a way of bringing to perfection the solitary life. &#160;When the past is put away, when the future is given up and when there is no craving and desire in the present, then the solitary life has been perfected in full.”</p>

          Since I went forth
          <br/>
          From home into homelessness
          <br/>
          I have never been aware of having
          <br/>
          Any ignoble or hateful thoughts, such as:
          <br/>
          <br/>
          ‘May they be killed. &#160;May they be slaughtered.
          <br/>
          May they come to harm.’
          <br/>
          Such thoughts have not crossed my mind
          <br/>
          For a long time.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          On the contrary, I am aware of thoughts of love,
          <br/>
          Infinite and well-developed,
          <br/>
          Practiced in due order
          <br/>
          As taught by the Buddha.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          I am a friend to all, a helper to all,
          <br/>
          I am sympathetic to all beings.
          <br/>
          I develop a mind full of love
          <br/>
          And delight always in harmlessness.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          I gladden my mind
          <br/>
          I make it immovable and unshakable.
          <br/>
          I develop the divine states
          <br/>
          Not cultivated by evil people.
