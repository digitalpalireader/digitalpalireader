When an ordinary man is touched by a painful feeling he worries and grieves, laments, beats his breast, weeps and is distraught. He therefore experiences a bodily feeling and a mental feeling. It is as if a man was pierced by a dart, and following the first piercing, he was hit by a second dart. He would experience the feelings caused by both darts. And so it is with the ordinary man. Having been touched by a painful feeling, he resists and resents it and so a deep tendency of resistance and resentment comes into being. Under the impact of that painful feeling he then proceeds to enjoy sensual happiness. And why does he do so? Because the ordinary man knows no other escape from painful feelings except the enjoyment of sensual happiness. Then in enjoying sensual happiness a deep tendency to lust for pleasant feelings comes into being. He does not know as it really is the arising and ending of those feelings, their satisfaction, their danger or the escape from them. In lacking this knowledge, the deep tendency to ignorance about neutral feelings comes into being. So whether he feels a pleasant, painful, or neutral feeling, he feels it as one fettered by it. He is fettered to birth, old age and death, to sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief and despair. He is fettered to suffering, I declare.\nBut when the instructed noble disciple is touched by a painful feeling, he does not worry, grieve or lament, he does not beat his breast or weep, nor is he distraught. It is one feeling only that he experiences, a bodily one and not a mental one. It is as if a man were pierced by a dart but was not pierced by another dart following the first one. And so it is with the instructed noble disciple. Having been touched by that painful feeling, he neither resists nor resents it, and so no deep tendency for resistance or resentment comes into being. \nHence, in consequence of the painful feeling he does not proceed to enjoy sensual happiness. And why not? Because he knows of an escape from painful feeling other than by enjoying sensual happiness. Then, in not enjoying sensual happiness, no deep tendency to lust for a pleasant feeling comes into being. He knows as it really is the arising and ending of those feelings, their satisfaction, their danger and the escape from them. Knowing this, no deep tendency to ignorance as to neutral feelings comes into being. So whether he feels a pleasant, painful or neutral feeling, he feels it as one free from it. He is free from birth, old age and death, from sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief and despair He is free from suffering, I declare.',null]);

Are the body, feeling, perception, mental constructs and consciousness permanent or impermanent?"\n"Impermanent, Lord."\n"So, seeing this, the instructed noble disciple turns away from these five aggregates. Turning away from them, passions fade, and with the fading of passions, he is free and he knows: \'Rebirth is destroyed, the holy life has been lived, what has had to be done is done; there is no more of this.\' \nSuppose there are two men, one a skilled traveller and the other not. And the unskilled traveller asks the way from the skilled one. He replies: \'Yes, my good man, this is the way. Continue for a while and you will see a fork in the road; take the right hand path. Go on a little, and you will come to a forest. Continue for a while more, and you will come to a marshy swamp. Go a little further, and you will see a great cliff. Go a little further still, and you will see a beautiful stretch of open ground.\' \nI use this parable to illustrate my meaning, and this is the meaning. The man unskilled in travel represents ordinary people, and the man skilled in travel represents the Tathagata, the Noble One, the fully enlightened Buddha. The fork in the road is the state of wavering, the left fork being the false eightfold path and the right fork being the Noble Eightfold Path. The thick forest is ignorance, the marshy swamp is desires, and the great cliff is irritation and despair. The delightful stretch of open ground is Nirvana. So be of good cheer, Tissa! Be of good cheer! I will counsel you, I will support you, I will instruct you."',null]);

Is body permanent or impermanent?"\n"Impermanent, sir."\n"Now, is what is impermanent painful or pleasant?"\n"Painful, sir."\n"Now, is it fit to regard what is impermanent and painful like this: \'This is mine, this is I, this is my self?"\n"No, sir."\n"And it is the same with feeling, perception, mental constructs and consciousness. So, any kind of body, feeling, perception, mental constructs or consciousness - whether past, present or future, whether gross or subtle, whether internal or external, whether inferior or superior, whether far or near - must with right understanding be regarded thus: \'This is not mine, this is not I, this is not myself.\' When a noble disciple has heard this and sees this, he is detached from body, feeling, perception, mental constructs and consciousness. Being detached, passions fade, with the fading of passions he is free, and when he is free he knows he is free. He knows: \'Birth is ended, the holy life has been lived, what has had to be done is done, there is no more of this.\' "',null]);
