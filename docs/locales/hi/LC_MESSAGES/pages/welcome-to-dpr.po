"The Digital Pali Reader (DPR) is a tool, much like a hard-copy language "
"reader, facilitating study of the Pali language at an advanced level. It "
"contains the entire Myanmar version of the Pali Tipitaka as found on the "
"Vipassana Research Institute's CSCD 3, as well as commentaries and sub-"
"commentaries where available. It also includes the Visuddhimagga, "
"Abhidhammatthasangaha and several ancient grammatical texts composed in "
"Pali, all available for analysis and translation. Additionally, it is "
"possible to install the Thai Tipitaka and commentaries (a work in "
"progress) as an alternative to the VRI tipitaka."

"Rather than offering a translation for the text being read, the DPR is "

" better to learn the language by actively reading the original texts than"
" by simply memorizing charts or vocabulary."
