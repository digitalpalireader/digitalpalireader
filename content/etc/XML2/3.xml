  <entry>[div class="huge"]Ādiccabandhu[/div][hr][p][b]1. Ādiccabandhu[/b].-An often-used epithet of the Buddha (E.g., D.iii.197; Sn.v.1128; Thag.  26, 158, 417, etc.).  The Vimanavatthu Commentary (p.116) says that Ādicca (the Sun) belonged to the Gotamagotta, as did also the Buddha, hence his epithet Ādiccabandhu; other explanations are given in the same context: the Buddha is born in the same ariyā jāti and is the descendant of the Sun (tam paticca tassa ariyāya jātiya jātattā), or the Sun is the Buddha's kinsman because the Sun is the Buddha's orasaputta (breast-born son) inasmuch as the Sun is the Buddha's disciple.  It is in this sense that in the Samyutta Nikāya (S.i.57) the Buddha speaks of the sun as "mama pajā," which Buddhaghosa (SA.i.86) explains as meaning disciple and spiritual son.[/p][p]Ādicca is described as tapatam mukham (chief of heat-producing things).  MA.ii.783.[/p][hr][p][b]2. Ādiccabandhu[/b].-A Pacceka Buddha who was instrumental in enabling the author (son of the King of Benares) of the twentieth verse of the Khaggavisāna Sutta to become a Pacceka Buddha.  Ādiccabandhu saw that the young prince, who had renounced the world and was living in his father's park near the city, did not, on account of the visits of his parents and others, have sufficient peace of mind to develop his power of meditation.[/p][p]He, therefore, visited the prince and persuaded him to go into the forest by showing him how real pabbajitas lived.  The first two lines of the Sutta Nipāta verse (No.  54) were uttered by Ādiccabandhu.  Sn.v.54; SnA.i.104-5; see also ApA.i.105, 152.[/p]</entry>
  <entry>[div class="huge"]Ātumā[/div][p]A town that lay between Kusinārā and Sāvatthi.  Once the Buddha, with a large company of bhikkhus, visited the town.  At that time there dwelt in it a monk who had been ordained late in life (a buddhapabbajita, identified by Buddhaghosa (DA.ii.599) with the buddhapabbajita Subhadda) and had formerly been a barber.  He had two sons, handsome, elegant and well versed in the barber's art.  When the monk heard of the Buddha's coming, he sent his sons from house to house to collect salt and oil and rice and meal.  The young men, using all their powers of persuasion, collected a large quantity of each of these things, and when the Buddha arrived in Ātumā and went to stay in the Bhūsāgāra, they made ready rice-gruel and offered it to him.  The Buddha, however, would not accept it as the monk, who had had the food collected, had been guilty of an unlawful act in that one monk had begged for others.[/p][p]It was on this occasion that it was declared to be a dukkata offence for a monk, who had formerly been a barber, to carry about with him a barber's equipment (Vin.i.249-50).[/p][p]In the Mahā Parinibbāna Sutta (D.ii.131-2) the Buddha tells Pukkusa of another occasion on which he was staying in the Bhūsāgāra in Ātumā.  There was a thunderstorm and two peasants (brothers) and four oxen were struck by lightning.  A large number of people having gathered at the place, one of them asked the Buddha if he were aware of the accident.  But the Buddha had been in a state of concentration and had neither seen nor heard anything of it.  Such was the state of calm of his mind.[/p]</entry>
  <entry>[div class="huge"]Āsanka Jātaka (No.  380)[/div][p]Once the Bodhisatta was an ascetic in the Himālaya.  At that time a being of great merit left Tāvatimsa and was born as a girl in the midst of a lotus in a pool near the Bodhisatta's hermitage.  The Bodhisatta, noticing some peculiarity in the growth of the lotus, swam to it and recovered the girl, whom he brought up as his daughter, giving her the name of Āsankā.  Sakka, coming to visit him, saw the girl, and, inquiring what he could do for her comfort, he provided her with a crystal palace and divine food and raiment.  She spent her time waiting on the Bodhisatta.  The King of  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/baranasi,Benares')"]Benares[/a], having heard of her great beauty, came to the forest with a large following and asked for her hand.  The Bodhisatta agreed, on condition that the king would tell him her name.  The king spent a whole year trying to guess it and, having failed, was returning home in despair, when the girl, looking out of her window, told him of the creeper Āsāvatī, for whose fruits gods wait for one thousand years.  She thus encouraged him to try again.  Another year passed and she again raised hopes in the disappointed king by relating to him the story of a crane whose hopes Sakka had fulfilled.  At the end of the third year the king, disgusted by his failure, started to go home, but again the girl engaged him in conversation, and in the course of their talk the girl's name was mentioned.  When the king was told that the word had occurred in his talk, he returned to the Bodhisatta and told it to him.  The Bodhisatta then gave Āsankā in marriage to the king (J.iii.248-54).

  <entry>[div class="huge"]Ābhassara[/div][p]A Brahma-world where live radiant devas from whose bodies rays of light are emitted, like lightning.  It belongs to the Rūpaloka and is in the plane of second jhāna (Abhs.  v.3; Compendium 138, n.4).  The devas living there subsist on joy[/p][p](pītibhakkha) (S.i.114.; DhA.iii.258; J.vi.55).  Their span of life is two kappas and there is no guarantee that a person who has been born there may not later be reborn in an unhappy condition (A.ii.127; but see Abhs.  v.6, where their life-span is given as eight kappas).  From time to time these devas utter shouts of joy saying "aho sukham, aho sukham." This sound is the best of sounds.  These devas are completely enveloped in ease (sukhena abhisaññā parisaññā) (A.iii.202; D.  iii.219).  Their world forms the third station of consciousness (viññānatthiti), they are of uniform body, but their perceptions are diverse (ekattakāyā nānat-tasaññino) (A.iv.40, 401; D.ii.69; D.iii.253).  During the periods of the development of the world many beings are born in the Abhassara realm and they are then called the highest of the devas, yet even they change their condition (A.v.60).  In lists of devas (E.g., M.i.289) they are given below the Appamānābhā and above the Subhā.  [/p][p][/p][p]Bodhisattas are sometimes born in the Ābhassara world (AA.i.73; J.i.406, 473; M.i.329; , MA.i.553; SA.i.162), but they are never born in Arūpa worlds even when they have developed Arūpa-jhānas.  Baka Brahmā was born in Ābhassara after having passed through Vehapphala and Subhakinna, and it was then that he conceived the belief that he was eternal.[/p][p]The Buddha visited him and convinced him of the error of his belief (J.iii.359).  When the universe is dissolved after the lapse of a long epoch and is again evolved, beings are mostly born in the Ābhassara world.  When, sooner or later, the world begins to re-evolve (vivattati), the Brahmavimāna appears, but it is empty.  Then some being or other, either because he has finished his life there or because his merit is exhausted, leaves the Ābhassara world and is reborn in the Brahmavimāna.  Others follow his example, and it is then that the first to be reborn in the Brahma-world thinks of himself as Brahmā, the eternal, etc.  (D.iii.29).[/p][p][/p][p]When inhabitants of the Ābhassara-world are reborn as humans, their existence continues to be like that which they had in the brahma-world itself.  As time goes on, however, they lose their qualities and develop the characteristics, both physical and mental, of human beings (For details see D.iii.84ff., PsA.253).  Buddhaghosa (DA.iii.865) says that their birth on earth is opapātika (by spontaneous regeneration) and they are mind-born (manomaya).[/p][p][/p][p]On the occasions when the world is destroyed by fire, the fire spread up to the Ābhassara-world; when by water, the water rises to the Subhakinna; when by wind, the wind reaches to the Vehapphala (CypA.9).[/p][p][/p][p]According to Buddhaghosa (MA.i.29; VibhA.520; cp.  DA.ii.510), the Ābhassaras are so called because radiance spreads from their bodies in all directions, like flames from a torch (dandadīpikāya acci viya etesam sarīrato ābhā chijjitvā chijjitvā patantī viya sarati visaratī ti Abhassarā).[/p][p][/p][p]According to the scholiast of the Candābha Jātaka (q.v.), beings who meditate on the Sun and Moon are born in this world.  The Moon appears at the wish of the Abhassara Brahmās.  See Candimā.[/p]</entry>

His mother was the daughter of a banker of  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/r/raajagaha,Rājagaha')"]Rājagaha[/a], and she, having failed to obtain her parent's consent to become a nun, married and, with her husband's consent, joined the Order, not knowing that she was with child.  When her condition was discovered her colleagues consulted  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/devadatta,Devadatta')"]Devadatta[/a], who declared that she was no true nun.  The  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddha,Buddha')"]Buddha[/a], on being consulted, entrusted the matter to  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/upaali,Upāli')"]Upāli[/a], who had it fully investigated by  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/visaakhaa,Visākhā')"]Visākhā[/a] and other residents of  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/saavatthi,Sāvatthi')"]Sāvatthi[/a], and he gave his finding in the assembly, in the presence of the king, that the nun was innocent.  (For details see J.i.148; Upāli's handling of the case won the Buddha's special commendation, see, e.g., AA.i.172).  When the boy was born the king reared him, and the boy was ordained at the age of seven.  The boy came to be called Kumāra, because he joined the Order so young and was of royal upbringing, and also because the Buddha, when sending him little delicacies such as fruit, referred to him as Kumāra Kassapa.  Once when Kumāra Kassapa was meditating in  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/andhavana,Andhavana')"]Andhavana[/a], an anāgāmī Brahmā, who had been his companion in the time of Kassapa Buddha, appeared before him, and asked him fifteen questions which only the Buddha could answer.  This led to the preaching of the  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/va/vammiika_sutta,Vammika Sutta')"]Vammika Sutta[/a] (M.i.143ff), and after dwelling on its teachings Kassapa became an arahant.  (For Kumāra Kassapa's story see J.i.147ff; AA.i.158f; ThagA.i.322f; MA.i.335f).  His mother, too, developed insight and attained to arahantship.  It is said that she wept for twelve years because she could not be with Kassapa, and one day, seeing him in the street, as she ran towards him and fell, milk flowed from her breasts and wet her robe.  Kassapa, realising that her great love was standing in the way of her attainments, spoke harshly to her that she might love him the less.  The ruse succeeded and she became an arahant that very day (DhA.iii.147).[/p][p]In the time of Padumuttara Buddha Kassapa was a learned brahmin, and having heard a monk ranked foremost in eloquence, he wished for a similar distinction and did many acts of piety towards that end.  When the teachings of Kassapa Buddha were being forgotten, he, together with six others, entered the Order and lived a life of rigorous asceticism on the summit of a mountain.  (Ap.ii.473f; the details of this story are given in DhA.ii.210-12; among Kassapa's companions were also Pukkusāti, Dārucīriya, Dabba Mallaputta and Sabhiya; see also UdA.80f).[/p][p]Two verses of deep significance ascribed to Kumāra-Kassapa are found in the Theragāthā (vv.201.202).  Although it is said that he was a very eloquent speaker, the examples given of his preaching are extremely scanty.  The Anguttara Commentary (i.159) states that the Buddha gave him his title from the skilful way in which he argued with Pāyāsi, as related in the  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/payasi,Pāyāsi Sutta')"]Pāyāsi Sutta[/a]; but this cannot be correct for, according to [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/dhammapaala,Dhammapāla')"]Dhammapāla[/a] (VvA.297), the events of the Pāyāsi Sutta took place after the Buddha's death.

A doubt arose as to whether this was valid because, according to the rule, twenty years must be completed for upasampadā.

A certain courtesan of the city walking about in the park, having lost the king's favour, saw Kisa-Vaccha, and considering the sight an ill-omen, she spat on him and threw her tooth stick at his head.  That same day she received again the patronage of the king and decided that it was as a result of spitting on the hermit.  Later, when the purohita lost his office, she advised him to do as she had done, and by coincidence he, too, was restored.  Some time after, the king going to quell a border rising, was advised to spit on the ascetic and throw his tooth stick at him; in this way he would find good luck.  The king followed this advice, all his soldiers doing likewise.  The king's general, a supporter of Kisa-Vaccha, bathed the holy man, and on being told that the Gods would destroy the kingdom unless apology were made, urged the king to apologise.

During his stay there his thoroughbred mare foaled, and the foal was given to the woman at her request, in part payment of her charges.  She brought up the foal as though he were her own child.  Some time after, the Bodhisatta, who was then a householder, happened to pass the same way and discovered the thoroughbred's presence by the behaviour of his own horses.  The woman agreed to part with the foal to him for a large price on condition that he should be provided with all manner of luxuries.  The Bodhisatta kept his word, and when the king came to inspect his horses, made the foal, who knew his own worth, exhibit his marvellous powers.  The king installed him as his state horse, and thereafter the lordship of all India passed into the king's hands.[/p][p][/p][p]The story was told in reference to Sāriputta.  Once, when the Buddha was returning to Sāvatthi after a tour, the citizens decided to celebrate his arrival by each one taking on himself the task of feeding a certain number of monks in the Buddha's retinue.  A poor old woman wished to feed a monk, but all the monks were already allotted, only Sāriputta remaining.  She invited him to her house, and he accepted her invitation.  When it became known that Sāriputta was to feed with her, the king and all the rich citizens of Sāvatthi sent her food and garments and money to help in her entertainment of the Elder.  As a result, through the kindness of Sāriputta, she became rich in a single day.[/p][p]Sāriputta is identified with the thoroughbred of the Jātaka (J.ii.286ff).[/p][p][/p][p]This is evidently the same story as that which, in the Dhammapada Commentary (iii.325), is called the Kundakasindhayapotaka Jātaka.

When the monks blamed Devadatta for his misdeeds, Kokālika was always ready to defend him (Vin.iii.174).  When Devadatta's gains diminished, Kokālika went about praising him, his birth, accomplishments and holiness, and many believed him (J.ii.438f).

He was the son of Kokāli-setthi of Kokāli and lived in the monastery erected by his father in Kokāli.  Once the two Chief Disciples, desiring quiet, spent the rainy season with him, he promising to tell nobody of their presence.  After the rains, as the Elders were about to return, Kokālika informed the inhabitants of their stay and blamed them for not showing them hospitality.  The townspeople hurried to the Elders with various offerings; these were, however, refused, and Kokālika, who had expected that the gifts would be given to him, was disappointed.  The Elders promised the townsmen to visit them again, and on their return were accompanied by a large following of monks to whom the townsmen showed all honour.  The gifts were divided among the monks, Kokālika not receiving a share.  He thereupon became abusive, and the Chief Disciples left the place.  The people were annoyed, and insisted that Kokālika should either bring them back or depart himself.

  <entry>[div class="huge"]Konāgamana (Konāgamana)[/div][p]The twenty-third in the list of the twenty-four Buddhas and the second Buddha to be born in the Bhaddakappa.  He was born in the Subhagavatī Park in Sobhavatī, the capital of King Sobha, his father being the brahmin Yaññadatta and his mother Uttarā.  He lived in the household for three thousand years, in three palaces, Tusita, Santusita and Santuttha; his chief wife was Rucigattā and their son was Satthavāha.  Konāgamana left the world on an elephant and practised austerities only for six months, at the end of which time he was given milk-rice by the daughter of the brahmin Aggisoma and grass for his seat by the yavapālaka Tinduka.  His Bodhi was an Udumbara tree.  His first sermon was preached in the Migadāya near Sudassana-nagara, at the foot of a Mahā-sāla tree.  He held only one assembly of his disciples, who numbered thirty thousand.  His body was thirty cubits in height.  He died in the Pabbatārāma at the age of thirty thousand.  His relics were scattered.  His chief disciples were Bhīyya and Uttara among monks, and Samuddā and Uttarā among nuns, his constant attendant being Sotthiya.  His chief patrons were Ugga and Somadeva among laymen, and Sīvalā and Sāmā among laywomen.  The Bodhisatta was a khattiya named Pabbata of Mithilā.  He held an almsgiving, heard the Buddha preach and joined the Order.  (D.i.7; Bu.xxiv; BuA.213ff; J.i.42f; according to the Jātaka his body was twenty cubits high; Sp.i.190).  [/p][p]The banker Ugga built for the Buddha a Sanghārāma half a league in extent (J.i.94).[/p][p]On the day of the Buddha's birth a shower of gold fell all over Jambudīpa, hence he was called Kanakāgamana, Konāgamana being a corrupt form of that word (BuA.213-14)[/p][p]According to the Ceylon Chronicles (Dpv.ii.67; xv.25, 44, 48; xvii.9, 17, 73; Mhv.xv.91-124), Konāgamana visited their Island (then known as Varadīpa), with thirty thousand disciples, accepted the Mahānoma garden at Vaddhamāna, given by King Samiddha, and preached the doctrine.  At the conclusion of his sermon, thirty thousand people realised the Truth.  At the Buddha's wish, the nun Kantakānandā (v.l.  Kanakadattā) brought to Ceylon a branch of the Bodhi-tree.  The Buddha also preached at the Ratanamāla, the Sudassanamāla and the Nāgamālaka and gave his girdle for the people's worship.  He left Mahāsumba and Kantakānandā to look after the new converts.[/p][p]In Konāgamana's time Mount Vepulla was known as Vankaka, and the people living on the mountain were called Rohitassā, their term of life being thirty thousand years (S.ii.191).  Konāgamana held the uposatha once a year (DhA.ii.236).[/p][p]In the Northern books (E.g., Dvy.333; Mtu.i.114; ii.265f, 300, 302, 304, 430; iii.240-7, 330) Konāgamana is called Kanakamuni, Konākamuni, and Kanakaparvata.  A Thūpa, erected on the spot where Konāgamana was born, is thought to have existed down to the time of Asoka, who rebuilt it to double its original size and worshipped it in his twentieth year (Hultszch: Inscrip.  of Asoka, p.165).  Hiouen Thsang (Beal, op.  cit., ii.19) says he saw thūpas at Konāgamana's birthplace and also at the spot where he met his father after the Enlightenment.

One day the cuckoo cried before it was grown up, and the crow killed it and threw it away.

  <entry>[div class="huge"]Kundadhāna Thera[/div][p]An arahant.  He was proclaimed the first among those who received food tickets (salāka) (A.i.24).  He came of a brahmin family of Sāvatthi and his name was Dhāna.  He knew the Vedas by heart, and when advanced in years, heard the Buddha preach and joined the Order.  From that day, however, in all his movements the form of a young woman followed him wherever he went, though he himself could not see the figure.  This caused great merriment and evoked many sarcastic remarks, which he could not understand.  When he went for alms women would put into his bowl two portions of food, saying, "One is for your Reverence and the other for your friend, the young lady, your companion." In the monastery the novices and young monks would point at him and say: "Look, our venerable one has become a konda" (gallant?).  From this he became known as Konda- or Kundadhāna.  Driven to distraction by this teasing, he became abusive and was reported to the Buddha, who hade him be patient as he was only being pursued by the remnant of an evil kamma.  Pasenadi, king of Kosala, hearing of Kundadhāna, was interested, and being satisfied by personal investigation that the Elder was blameless, provided him with all necessaries, so that he need no longer go round for alms.  This enabled him to concentrate his mind, and he became an arahant.  Thereupon the figure of the woman disappeared.[/p][p][/p][p]Kundadhāna's claim to be the first among receivers of salāka was due to the fact that he it was who received the first food-ticket when the Buddha visited [/p][ul][li][p]Mahā-Subhaddā at Ugganagara, [/li][li][p]Culla-Subhaddā at Sāketa, and also [/li][li][p]the Sunāparanta-janapada.  [/li][/ul][p]Only khīnāsavas were allowed to accompany the Buddha on these visits.[/p][p][/p][p]Kundadhāna's determination to attain this special eminence was formed in the time of Padumuttara Buddha.  Once he gave Padumuttara a well-ripened "comb" of bananas when the Buddha arose from a long trance.  As a result he became king of the devas eleven times and king of men twenty-four times.[/p][p][/p][p]He was an earthbound sprite in the time of Kassapa Buddha.  Seeing two monks, firm friends, on their way to the uposatha held by the Buddha, he had a mischievous desire to test their friendship, and when one of the monks retired into the forest leaving the other on the road, he followed the former, unseen by him, assuming the form of a woman arranging her hair, adjusting her garments, and so on.  The second monk, seeing his friend return and shocked by his apparent misdemeanour, left him in disgust, refusing to perform the uposatha with him.  Realising the effect of his practical joke, the sprite did all he could to make amends, but the friendship of the two monks was for ever spoilt.  The sprite suffered the fears of hell for a whole Buddha-era, and even in his last birth as Kundadhāna his evil kamma pursued him, as seen above.  AA.i.146ff; Thag.A.i.62ff; also Ap.i.81f; Thag.15. The version given in Dh A.iii.52f differs very slightly in certain details.[/p][p][/p][p]Kundadhāna was among those to whom the Buddha preached the Nalakapāna Sutta, and was therefore probably a friend of Anuruddha and the other Sākyan nobles present on that occasion (M.i.462).  v.l.

There was a monastery on Kotapabbatta called the Kotapabbata-vihāra.  This was the residence of the Sāmanera who was afterwards born as Dutthagāmanī (Mhv.xxii.25); also of Mahā-Summa Thera (Mhv.xxiii.61), of Asubhakammika-Tissa and of his teacher Mahā-Tissa (MT.553).  The Vihāra was near Mahāgāma (MT.553).[/p][p]The Visuddhi Magga (p.292) mentions an Elder, Tissa, of Kota (Koti) pabbata, who, having attained arahantship through meditation on breathing, was able to limit the term of his life.  According to the Dhammapada Commentary (iv.50), an Elder named Anula lived in the monastery during the time of Dutthagāmanī, and the village Bhokkanta, residence of Sumanā, wife of Lakuntaka Atimbara, was in its vicinity.  It was probably the same as Gotapabbata (q.v.) (See Mhv.xxxv.124; MT.667).  The Nāgalena was in the Kotapabbata-vihāra (DA.ii.695).[/p]</entry>

Koka sets his dogs on the monk, and when the latter climbs a tree, pierces the soles of his feet with arrows.  The monk's cloak falls upon the hunter, completely covering him.  The dogs, thinking that the monk has fallen from the tree, devour their own master.  The monk, fearing that he is to blame, seeks the Buddha, who reassures him and relates the story of a wicked physician who cajoled a boy into catching a snake, pretending that it was a bird.  When the boy discovered that it was a snake, he threw it on the physician's head, who died from its bite.[/p][p][/p][p]The physician is identified with Koka.  DhA.iii.31f.

In exasperation Khemaka came himself to Ghositārāma and explained how, even when the Noble Disciple has put away the five lower fetters, there still clings to him a subtle remnant of the "I" conceit.  It is said that as a result of the sermon Khemaka himself and sixty others became arahants (S.iii.126ff).[/p][p]The Commentary (SA.ii.230f) explains that the monks wished to hear Khemaka because they knew his ability, and they also knew that if they showed keenness to learn he would come to them.

  <entry>[div class="huge"]Kimbila, Kimila, Kimmila-Thera[/div][p]A Sākiyan of Kapilavatthu.  He was converted with Bhaddiya and four other Sākyan nobles at Anupiyā, shortly after the Buddha's visit to Kapilavatthu (Vin.ii.182; DhA.i.112f).  The Theragāthā Commentary says (ThagA.i.235f; Thag.118, 155f, According to DhA.i.117, Kimbila became an arahant soon after ordination together with Bhagu; see also J.i.140 and AA.i.108) that while at Anupiyā the Buddha, in order to arouse Kimbila, conjured up a beautiful woman in her prime and then showed her to him passing into old age.  Greatly agitated, Kimbila sought the Buddha, heard the Doctrine and, having entered the Order, in due course won arahantship.  Kimbila seems to have maintained throughout his early friendship with Anuruddha, dwelling with him and Nandiya, now in this wood or park, now in that.  The Buddha visited them at Pācīna-vamsadāya when he was going away, disgusted with the recalcitrant monks of Kosambī.  (Vin.i.350; J.iii.489; see also Upakkilesa Sutta, M.iii.155ff and ThagA.i.275f).  They were in the Gosingasālavana when the Buddha preached to them the Cūla-Gosinga Sutta, at the conclusion of which, Dīgha Parajana Yakkha sang the praises of all three (M.i.205ff).  Their number was increased by the presence of Bhagu, Kundadhāna, Revata and Ananda, on the occasion when the Buddha preached the Nalakapāna Sutta in the Palāsavana at Nalakapāna (M.i.462ff).[/p][p][/p][p]In three different places in the Anguttara Nikāya (A.iii.247; 339; iv.84) record is made of a conversation between Kimbila and the Buddha, when Kimbila asks how the Dhamma could be made to endure long after the Buddha's death and what were the causes which might bring about its early disappearance.  The conversation took place in the Veluvana (Niceluvana?) in Kimbilā.  According to the Anguttara Commentary (AA.ii.642), however, it would appear that the Kimbila mentioned here was not Kimbila the Sākyan but another.  We are told that this Kimbila was a setthiputta of Kimbilā.  He joined the Order and acquired the power of knowing his previous births.  He recollected how he had been a monk at the time when Kassapa Buddha's religion was falling into decay, and seeing how the Faith was neglected by its followers, he made a stairway up a cliff and lived there as a recluse.  It was this memory of his previous life which prompted Kimbila's question.[/p][p]Elsewhere (S.v.322f ) the Buddha is reported as questioning Kimbila at the same spot on the question of breathing.  Kimbila remains silent though the question is put three times.  Ananda intervenes and suggests that the Buddha should himself furnish the answer so that the monks may learn it and profit thereby.[/p][p][/p][p]In the time of Kakusandha Buddha, Kimbila had been a householder; after the Buddha's death he erected a pavilion of salala-garlands round his cetiya (ThagA.i.235).  He is probably to be identified with Salalamandapiya Thera of the Apadāna (Ap.i.333).[/p][p][/p][p]The Dhammapada Commentary (DhA.i.115; iv.126) mentions a story which shows how delicately nurtured Kimbila was.  One day, in a discussion with his friends, Anuruddha and Bhaddiya, as to where rice came from, Kimbila remarked that it came from the granary (kotthe).[/p][hr][p][b]2.

The monkey thereupon became virtuous and refused to return to his evil ways, even after the arrival of his former friends.[/p][p]The story was told at the Pubbārāma, in reference to some monks who lived there in the apartments below those of the Buddha, and who were quarrelsome and abusive.

Later the king, having dreamed of heaven, asked Khandahāla the way thither; the chaplain replied that the way lay through a sacrifice in which all the king's sons, his queens, his merchant princes, and his most treasured possessions should be offered.  Khandahāla hoped thereby to bring about the death of Candakumāra.  Ekarājā accepted the suggestion and made all preparations for the sacrifice.  Several times the king wavered in his resolve, being interceded with by his parents, Canda and his wives, and the people.  Khandahāla goaded him on, but at the moment when the sword was about to descend on the neck of Candakumāra, the latter's wife, Candā, daughter of the Pañcāla king, made an "act of truth," and Sakka appeared, brandishing a thunderbolt.

The Commentaries (DA.i.260f; SNA.i.356f; A.ii.558; ThagA.i.546; also Ap.i.94) contain accounts of the origin of the Koliyas.  We are told that a king of Benares, named Rāma (the Mtu.i.353 calls him Kola and explains from this the name of the Koliyas), suffered from leprosy, and being detested by the women of the court, he left the kingdom to his eldest son and retired into the forest.  There, living on woodland leaves and fruits, he soon recovered, and, while wandering about, came across Piyā, the eldest of the five daughters of Okkāka, she herself being afflicted with leprosy.  Rāma, having cured her, married her, and they begot thirty-two sons.  With the help of the king of Benares, they built a town in the forest, removing a big kola-tree in doing so.  The city thereupon came to be called Kolanagara, and because the site was discovered on a tiger-track (vyagghapatha) it was also called Vyagghapajjā.  The descendants of the king were known as Koliyā.  [/p][p]According to the Kunālā Jātaka (J.v.413), when the Sākyans wished to abuse the Koliyans, they said that the Koliyans had once "lived like animals in a Kola-tree," as their name signified.  The territories of the Sākiyans and the Koliyans were adjacent, separated by the river Rohinī.  The khattiyas of both tribes intermarried, and both claimed relationship with the Buddha.  (It is said that once the Koliyan youths carried away many Sākiyan maidens while they were bathing, but the Sākiyans, regarding the Koliyans as relatives, took no action; DA.i.262).  A quarrel once arose between the two tribes regarding the right to the waters of the Rohinī, which irrigated the land on both sides, and a bloody feud was averted only by the intervention of the Buddha.  In gratitude, each tribe dedicated some of its young men to the membership of the Order, and during the Buddha's stay in the neighbourhood, he lived alternately in Kapilavatthu and in Koliyanagara.

  <entry>[div class="huge"]Kelisīla Jātaka (No.202)[/div][p]Brahmadatta, king of Benares, could not look upon anyone old or decrepit without playing jokes on them.  He made old men roll about on the ground and played practical jokes on old women.  His friends behaved likewise.  All old people left his country; no parents or aged persons remained to be tended by the young, and newcomers among the gods were few in number.  Sakka (the Bodhisatta), wishing to teach the king a lesson, once appeared before him in the guise of an old man, with two jars of butter milk in a crazy old cart, having willed that only the king should be able to see him.  The king was riding his state elephant, and when he asked the old tarter to move the latter dashed the two jars on the king's head and the onlookers laughed to see the milk dripping down his face.  Resuming Sakka's form, the Bodhisatta admonished the king.[/p][p][/p][p]The story was related to account for Lakuntaka Bhaddiya's deformity.  J.ii.142-4.[/p]</entry>

The following day he invited the whole company to a meal and showed great hospitality.  It was as a result of the drinks offered by Keniya that the Buddha laid down a rule as to which drinks were permissible for monks and which were not (Vin.i.245f).[/p][p]According to the Sutta Nipāta (p.104; M.ii.146f; see also ThagA.ii.47), it was owing to the elaborate preparations made by Keniya for the meal to the Buddha and the Sangha that the brahmin Sela, friend and counsellor of Keniya, came to discover the Buddha's presence in Āpana.  The result was the conversion and ordination of Sela and his three hundred pupils.[/p][p]Buddhaghosa says (SNA.ii.440; MA.ii.779; Ap.i.318) that Keniya was a mahāsāla-brahmin, and that he became a Jatila with the object of protecting his wealth.  He bought some land from the king and built his hermitage there, and became the protector (nissaya) of one thousand families.  In his hermitage was a palm tree which yielded a golden nut each day.  Keniya was a yellow-robed ascetic by day; by night he enjoyed the pleasures of the senses.  On his first visit to the Buddha he took five hundred pingo-loads of badarapāna (SNA.ii.446) (? grape juice).[/p][p]Keniya is mentioned (E.g., DA.i.270; see also DhA.i.323; UdA.241) as an example of one of the eight classes of ascetics - those who maintain wife and children (sa-puttabhariya).[/p][hr][p][b]2.

Once when the Buddha was staying in Vesalī, a poor man, wishing to give alms to him and to the monks, asked Kirapatika for money to provide the alms; Kirapatika gladly gave him much money and the Buddha and the monks were invited.  But the monks, having heard of the man's poverty, had a full meal earlier, so that when the man served them with the food he had prepared they could eat but very little.  The man was greatly offended and the Buddha, hearing of it, made an order to the monks prohibiting such conduct (Vin.iv.75f).[/p][p][/p][p]Buddhaghosa says (Sp.iv.817) that the householder's name was Kira, but that he was called Kirapatika on account of his great influence.

Perhaps the former was the name of the county and the latter that of its capital.  From here to Sāvatthi was a distance of one hundred and twenty leagues, and there was a trade route between the two cities which merchants travelled on foot (janghavānijā), and also a route from the Majjhimadesa.  Three rivers had to be crossed on the way: the Aravacchā, the Nīlavāhanā and the Candabhāgā.  DhA.ii.116ff; a less detailed account is given in SA.ii.177f and AA.i.175f.[/p]</entry>
  <entry>[div class="huge"]Korabya, Koravya, Korabba[/div][p]Perhaps the generic name given to the king of the Kurūs (cf.  Brahmadatta).  Once in the Jātakas Koravya is given as the name of the king of Indapatta in the Kuru country, this king being the father of Sutasoma (J.v.457).  Elsewhere (J.ii.368; iii.400, 402; v.59, 61, 65; vi.256, 268, 273) Koravya appears as a title of Dhanañjaya, king of the Kurūs.  Koravya may also have been used as an adjective, for we find it explained as Kururatthavāsika (E.g., J.vi.273).  The Koravya king probably belonged to the Yudhitthilagotta (See J.iv.361).  The Anguttara Nikāya (iii.369f) mentions a king Koravya who owned a large banyan tree named Suppatittha.  According to the Ratthapāla Sutta (M.ii.65; see also Thag.776.ff; ThagA.ii.34; for details see Ratthapāla), in the Buddha's day, too, the ruler of Kuru was called Koravyarājā, and he owned a park which seems to have been called Migācīra (q.v.).  This king was evidently interested in religious discussion.  Thullakotthika was his capital.  The Avadānasataka (i.67; ii.118; see also Camb.  Hist.  of India, i.121, which refers to a half-mythical Pañcāla king, Kraivya) speaks of a Kauravya of Thullakotthika.[/p]</entry>
  <entry>[div class="huge"]Kosambī[/div][p]The capital of the Vatsas or Vamsas (J.iv.28; vi.236).  In the time of the  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddha,Buddha')"]Buddha[/a] its king was Parantapa, and after him reigned his son  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/udena,Udena')"]Udena[/a].  (MA.ii.740f; DhA.i.164f).  Kosambī was evidently a city of great importance at the time of the Buddha for we find  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/aa/aananda,Ananda')"]Ananda[/a] mentioning it as one of the places suitable for the Buddha's Parinibbāna (D.ii.146,169).

The usual route from  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/r/raajagaha,Rājagaha')"]Rājagaha[/a] to Kosambī was up the river (this was the route taken by Ananda when he went with five hundred others to inflict the higher punishment on  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/channa,Channa')"]Channa[/a], Vin.ii.290), though there seems to have been a land route passing through  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/anupiya,Anupiya')"]Anupiya[/a] and Kosambī to  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/r/raajagaha,Rājagaha')"]Rājagaha[/a].  (See Vin.ii.184f).

The Buddha is mentioned as having once stayed in the Simsapāvana in Kosambī (S.v.437).  Mahā Kaccāna lived in a woodland near Kosambī after the holding of the First Council (PvA.141).[/p][p]Already in the Buddha's time there were four establishments of the Order in Kosambī - the Kukkutārāma, the Ghositārāma, the Pāvārika-ambavana (these being given by three of the most eminent citizens of Kosambī, named respectively, Kukkuta, Ghosita and Pāvārika), and the Badarikārāma.  The Buddha visited Kosambī on several occasions, stopping at one or other of these residences, and several discourses delivered during these visits are recorded in the books.  (Thomas, op.  cit., 115, n.2, doubts the authenticity of the stories connected with the Buddha's visits to Kosambī, holding that these stories are of later invention).[/p][p]The Buddha spent his ninth rainy season at Kosambī, and it was on his way there on this occasion that he made a detour to Kammāssadamma and was offered in marriage Māgandiyā, daughter of the brahmin Māgandiya.  The circumstances are narrated in connection with the Māgandiya Sutta.  Māgandiyā took the Buddha's refusal as an insult to herself, and, after her marriage to King Udena, tried in various ways to take revenge on the Buddha, and also on Udena's wife Sāmavatī, who had been the Buddha's follower.  (DhA.i.199ff; iii.193ff; iv.1ff; Ud.vii.10).[/p][p]A great schism once arose among the monks in Kosambī.  Some monks charged one of their colleagues with having committed an offence, but he refused to acknowledge the charge and, being himself learned in the Vinaya, argued his case and pleaded that the charge be dismissed.  The rules were complicated; on the one hand, the monk had broken a rule and was treated as an offender, but on the other, he should not have been so treated if he could not see that he had done wrong.  The monk was eventually excommunicated, and this brought about a great dissension.  When the matter was reported to the Buddha, he admonished the partisans of both sides and urged them to give up their differences, but they paid no heed, and even blows were exchanged.  The people of Kosambī, becoming angry at the monks' behaviour, the quarrel grew apace.  The Buddha once more counselled concord, relating to the monks the story of King Dīghiti of Kosala, but his efforts at reconciliation were of no avail, one of the monks actually asking him to leave them to settle their differences without his interference.  In disgust the Buddha left Kosambī and, journeying through Bālakalonakāragāma and the Pācīnavamsadaya, retired alone to keep retreat in the Pārileyyaka forest.  In the meantime the monks of both parties repented, partly owing to the pressure exerted by their lay followers in Kosambī, and, coming to the Buddha at Sāvatthi, they asked his pardon and settled their dispute.  (Vin.i.337-57; J.iii.486ff (cp.iii.211ff); DhA.i.44ff; SA.ii.222f; the story of the Buddha going into the forest is given in Ud.iv.5. and in S.iii.94, but the reason given in these texts is that he found Kosambī uncomfortable owing to the vast number of monks, lay people and heretics.  But see UdA.248f, and SA.ii.222f).[/p][p]The Commentaries give two reasons for the name Kosambī.  The more favoured is (E.g., UdA.248; SNA.300; MA.i.535. Epic tradition ascribes the foundation of Kosambī to a Cedi prince, while the origin of the Vatsa people is traced to a king of Kāsī, see PHAI.83, 84) that the city was so called because it was founded in or near the site of the hermitage once occupied by the sage Kusumba (v.l.  Kusumbha).  Another explanation is (e.g., MA i.539; PsA.413) that large and stately margossa-trees (Kosammarukkhā) grew in great numbers in and around the city.[/p][p]Bakkula was the son of a banker in Kosambī.  (MA.ii.929; AA.i.170).  In the Buddha's time there lived near the ferry at Kosambī a powerful Nāga-king, the reincarnation of a former ship's captain.  The Nāga was converted by Sāgata, who thereby won great fame.  (AA.i.179; but see J.i.360, where the incident is given as happening at Bhaddavatikā).  Rujā was born in a banker's family in Kosambī (J.vi.237f).  Citta-pandita was also born there (J.iv.392).  A king, by name Kosambaka (q.v.), once ruled there.[/p][p]During the time of the Vajjian heresy, when the Vajjian monks of Vesāli wished to excommunicate Yasa Kākandakaputta, he went by air to Kosambī, and from there sent messengers to the orthodox monks in the different centres (Vin.ii.298; Mhv.iv.17).[/p][p]It was at Kosambī that the Buddha promulgated a rule forbidding the use of intoxicants by monks (Vin.ii.307).[/p][p]Kosambī is mentioned in the Samyutta Nikāya (S.iv.179; but see AA.i.170; MA.ii.929; PsA.491, all of which indicate that the city was on the Yamunā) as being "Gangāya nadiyā tīre." This is either an error, or here the name Gangā refers not to the Ganges but to the Yamunī.  Kosambī is identified with the two villages of Kosam on the Jumna, about ninety miles west of Allahabad.  (CAGI.448f; Vincent Smith places it further south, J.R.A.S.1898, 503ff).[/p]</entry>

Twice the Buddha refused; the third time he gave his permission.  Meghiya went, but soon returned, finding that he could not concentrate his mind there.  The river was evidently in the neighbourhood of Cālikā (A.iv.354f; ThagA.i.149; Ud.iv.1).

The Bodhisatta, having been born as Kappa, a brahmin of Kāsī, joined him and became his senior pupil.  When the ascetics went to Benares for salt and vinegar, the king lodged them in his park and fed them, and when they returned to Himavā, persuaded Kesava to stay behind.  Kesava fell ill of loneliness, and the five physicians of the king could not cure him.  At his own request he was taken to the Himālaya by the king's minister, Nārada, and there, on seeing again his familiar haunts and his pupil Kappa, he immediately recovered, though his medicine was but the broth of wild rice.[/p][p][/p][p]The king of the Jātaka is Ananda, Nārada is Sāriputta, and Kesava, Baka Brahmā.[/p][p]The story was related to Pasenadi.  Having discovered that Anāthapindika daily fed five hundred monks in his house, the king gave orders that the same should be done in his palace.  One day he discovered that the monks would take the food from the palace, but would eat that which was given to them elsewhere by those who served them because they loved them.  When the king reported this to the Buddha, the Buddha pointed out to him that the best food was that which was given in love; love was the best flavouring for food (J.iii.142-5; iii.362; S.i.144; SA.i.165).[/p][p][/p][p]According to the Dhammapada Commentary (DhA.i.342ff), the king personally looked after the monks for seven days, after which he forgot about them and they were uncared for.  Thereupon they omitted to go to the palace.[/p][p]The story of the past as given in this Commentary differs considerably from the Jātaka-version.  Here Kesava is described as a king who had left the world and become an ascetic.  The ascetics left the royal park, disliking the noise there, but they left Kappa with Kesava.  Soon after, Kappa went away, and it was then that Kesava fell ill.[/p][p]Kesava is identified with the Bodhisatta, Kappa with Ananda, the king of Benares with Moggallāna, and Nārada with Sāriputta.[/p][p][/p][p]It was this reluctance of the Sākyan monks to accept Pasenadi's hospitality which led him to seek marriage with a Sākyan maiden; but the Sākyans gave him Vāsabhakhattiyā (q.v.).[/p]</entry>

One day, while returning from the park, the prince saw a Pacceka Buddha, and being angry that obeisance should be paid to the Buddha instead of to himself, he took the Buddha's bowl and dashed it on the ground.  The prince's body burst into flames, but all the water around having dried up, they could not be quenched and he was swallowed up in hell.  When Kitavāsa heard of this he was greatly grieved, but on reflection he realised that his grief sprang from affection, and thenceforth resolved to fix his love on nothing.[/p][p]Kitavāsa is identified with Chattapāni of the Dhammaddhaja Jātaka, Chattapāni himself being a former birth of Sāriputta (J.ii.194ff).[/p][p][/p][p]The story of Kitavāsa's son bears close resemblance to that of Kitava's son (see Kundinagariya Thera).

  <entry>[div class="huge"]Kosala[/div][p]A country inhabited by the Kosalā, to the north-west of Magadha and next to Kāsī.  It is mentioned second in the list of sixteen Mahājanapadas (E.g., A.i.213; iv.252, etc.).  In the Buddha's time it was a powerful kingdom ruled over by Pasenadi, who was succeeded by his son Vidūdabha.  By this time Kāsī was under the subjection of Kosala, for we find that when Bimbisāra, king of Magadha, married Kosaladevī, daughter of Mahākosala and sister of Pasenadi, a village in Kāsī was given as part of the dowry (J.ii.237; iv.342f).  Various Jātakas indicate that the struggle between Kāsi and Kosala had been very prolonged (See, e.g., J.ii.21f; iii.115f; 211f; v.316, 425).  Sometimes the Kāsi king would attack Kosala, capture the king and rule over the country.  At others the Kosala king would invade Kāsi and annex it to his own territory.  Several Kosala kings who succeeded in doing this, are mentioned by name - e.g., Dabbasena (J.iii.13), Dīghāvu (J.iii.211f), Vanka (J.iii.168) and Kamsa; the last being given the special title of "Bāranāsiggāha," (J.ii.403; v.112) probably in recognition of the fact that he completed the conquest of Kāsi.  Other kings of Kosala who came in conflict with Benares in one way or another are mentioned - e.g., Dīghiti (J.iii.211f; Vin.i.342f), Mallika (J.ii.3), and Chatta (J.iii.116).  Sometimes the kings of the two countries entered into matrimonial alliances (e.g., J.iii.407).  With the capture of Kāsi the power of Kosala increased rapidly, until a struggle between this country and Magadha became inevitable.  Bimbisāra's marriage was probably a political alliance, but it only served to postpone the evil day.  Quite soon after his death there were many fierce fights between Ajātasattu, his successor, and Pasenadi, these fights bringing varying fortunes to the combatants.  Once Ajātasattu was captured alive, but Pasenadi spared his life and gave him his daughter, Vajirā, in marriage and for a time all went well.  Later, however, after his conquest of the Licchavis, Ajātasattu seems to have succeeded in establishing his sway in Kosala.  (See Vincent Smith, op.  cit., 32f).  In the sixth century B.C.  the Sākyan territory of Kapilavatthu was subject to Kosala.  The Sutta Nipāta (vs.405) speaks of the Buddha's birthplace as belonging to the Kosalans; see also A.i.276, where Kapilavatthu is mentioned as being in Kosala.  Elsewhere (M.ii.124) Pasenadi is reported as saying, "Bhagavā pi Kosalako, aham pi Kosalako."[/p][p][/p][p]At the time of the Buddha Sāvatthi was the capital of Kosala.  Next in importance was Saketa, which, in ancient days, had sometimes been the capital (J.iii.270; Mtu.i.348).  There was also Ayojjhā, on the banks of the Sarayu, which, judging from the Rāmāyana, must once have been the chief city; but in the sixth century B.C.  it was quite unimportant.[/p][p][/p][p]The river Sarayu divided Kosala into two parts, Uttara Kosala and Dakkhina Kosala (Law: Geog., p.6).

It is said that when nothing could make Mahāpanāda smile, his father offered a big reward for anyone who could succeed in doing this.  People, accordingly, left their work and flocked to the court, but it, was not until Sakka sent down a celestial actor that Mahāpanāda showed any signs of being amused.  When this happened the men returned to their various duties, and on their way home, when meeting their friends, they asked of each other, "Kacci bho kusalam, kacci bho kusalam."

(See Vinaya Index, s.v.  Kosala).  It is said (SA.i.221) that alms were plentiful in Kosala, though, evidently (J.i.329), famines, due to drought, were not unknown.  Yet, though woodland tracts were numerous (see, e.g., SA.i.225) where monks could meditate in solitude, the number of monks actually found in Kosala was not large (VT.i.226).

  <entry>[div class="huge"]Kujjatissa Thera[/div][p]An arahant.  He lived in Mangana in Ceylon, and was mentioned by the Sangha to King Saddhātissa as being worthy of his special worship.  The king travelled five leagues to see him, but the thera, lest the king should invite him to the palace, lay down on a bed at the time of the king's arrival and started scratching letters on the floor.  The king decided that the thera was not an arahant and went away.  When he was blamed for having displeased so pious a king, the thera undertook to make amends.  He requested that, after his death, he should be placed in a covered palanquin containing also a second bed.  This was done and the palanquin travelled by air to Anurādhapura, performing many miracles, applauded by the people.  In Anurādhapura it circled round the Thūpārāma and the Silācetiya and, when it reached the Lohapāsāda, the thera Mahāvyaggha entered the palanquin, lay down on the spare bed and entered Nibbāna.  The king made offerings of flowers and perfumes to the palanquin and it descended to earth, for such had been Kujjatissa's desire.  The bodies were burnt and thūpas were erected over the relics.

  <entry>[div class="huge"]Kharadāthika[/div][p]A yakkha.  The Bodhisatta, who became Mangala Buddha in one of his later births, left his kingdom and lived as a recluse in the forest with his wife and children.  The yakkha, having heard of the Bodhisatta's generosity, came to him, begged for his two children, and on being given them ate them in the sight of their father.  Even when the blood flowed from the yakkha's mouth the Bodhisatta remained unmoved, and wished that in the future there should issue from his own body rays of light, in colour like to streams of blood.  As a result of this wish Mangala's aura always spread throughout the ten thousand world systems, while that of other Buddhas spread as a rule only one fathom from their body.

At last, when as a result of his extreme piety Anāthapindika's wealth was exhausted, the devatā ventured to approach him and warn him of his impending ruin if he did not take heed.  He ordered her out of the house, and she had, perforce, to obey.  In despair she sought the aid of Sakka, who suggested that she should recover for the merchant all his debts, and reveal to him his hidden treasure which had been lost sight of.

The Buddha is mentioned as having once stayed in the Simsapāvana in Kosambī (S.v.437).  Mahā Kaccāna lived in a woodland near Kosambī after the holding of the First Council (PvA.141).[/p][p]Already in the Buddha's time there were four establishments of the Order in Kosambī - the Kukkutārāma, the Ghositārāma, the Pāvārika-ambavana (these being given by three of the most eminent citizens of Kosambī, named respectively, Kukkuta, Ghosita and Pāvārika), and the Badarikārāma.  The Buddha visited Kosambī on several occasions, stopping at one or other of these residences, and several discourses delivered during these visits are recorded in the books.  (Thomas, op.  cit., 115, n.2, doubts the authenticity of the stories connected with the Buddha's visits to Kosambī, holding that these stories are of later invention).[/p][p]The Buddha spent his ninth rainy season at Kosambī, and it was on his way there on this occasion that he made a detour to Kammāssadamma and was offered in marriage Māgandiyā, daughter of the brahmin Māgandiya.  The circumstances are narrated in connection with the Māgandiya Sutta.  Māgandiyā took the Buddha's refusal as an insult to herself, and, after her marriage to King Udena, tried in various ways to take revenge on the Buddha, and also on Udena's wife Sāmavatī, who had been the Buddha's follower.  (DhA.i.199ff; iii.193ff; iv.1ff; Ud.vii.10).[/p][p]A great schism once arose among the monks in Kosambī.  Some monks charged one of their colleagues with having committed an offence, but he refused to acknowledge the charge and, being himself learned in the Vinaya, argued his case and pleaded that the charge be dismissed.  The rules were complicated; on the one hand, the monk had broken a rule and was treated as an offender, but on the other, he should not have been so treated if he could not see that he had done wrong.  The monk was eventually excommunicated, and this brought about a great dissension.  When the matter was reported to the Buddha, he admonished the partisans of both sides and urged them to give up their differences, but they paid no heed, and even blows were exchanged.  The people of Kosambī, becoming angry at the monks' behaviour, the quarrel grew apace.  The Buddha once more counselled concord, relating to the monks the story of King Dīghiti of Kosala, but his efforts at reconciliation were of no avail, one of the monks actually asking him to leave them to settle their differences without his interference.  In disgust the Buddha left Kosambī and, journeying through Bālakalonakāragāma and the Pācīnavamsadaya, retired alone to keep retreat in the Pārileyyaka forest.  In the meantime the monks of both parties repented, partly owing to the pressure exerted by their lay followers in Kosambī, and, coming to the Buddha at Sāvatthi, they asked his pardon and settled their dispute.  (Vin.i.337-57; J.iii.486ff (cp.iii.211ff); DhA.i.44ff; SA.ii.222f; the story of the Buddha going into the forest is given in Ud.iv.5. and in S.iii.94, but the reason given in these texts is that he found Kosambī uncomfortable owing to the vast number of monks, lay people and heretics.  But see UdA.248f, and SA.ii.222f).[/p][p]The Commentaries give two reasons for the name Kosambī.  The more favoured is (E.g., UdA.248; SNA.300; MA.i.535. Epic tradition ascribes the foundation of Kosambī to a Cedi prince, while the origin of the Vatsa people is traced to a king of Kāsī, see PHAI.83, 84) that the city was so called because it was founded in or near the site of the hermitage once occupied by the sage Kusumba (v.l.

Another explanation is (e.g., MA i.539; PsA.413) that large and stately margossa-trees (Kosammarukkhā) grew in great numbers in and around the city.[/p][p]Bakkula was the son of a banker in Kosambī.  (MA.ii.929; AA.i.170).  In the Buddha's time there lived near the ferry at Kosambī a powerful Nāga-king, the reincarnation of a former ship's captain.  The Nāga was converted by Sāgata, who thereby won great fame.  (AA.i.179; but see J.i.360, where the incident is given as happening at Bhaddavatikā).  Rujā was born in a banker's family in Kosambī (J.vi.237f).  Citta-pandita was also born there (J.iv.392).  A king, by name Kosambaka (q.v.), once ruled there.[/p][p]During the time of the Vajjian heresy, when the Vajjian monks of Vesāli wished to excommunicate Yasa Kākandakaputta, he went by air to Kosambī, and from there sent messengers to the orthodox monks in the different centres (Vin.ii.298; Mhv.iv.17).[/p][p]It was at Kosambī that the Buddha promulgated a rule forbidding the use of intoxicants by monks (Vin.ii.307).[/p][p]Kosambī is mentioned in the Samyutta Nikāya (S.iv.179; but see AA.i.170; MA.ii.929; PsA.491, all of which indicate that the city was on the Yamunā) as being "Gangāya nadiyā tīre." This is either an error, or here the name Gangā refers not to the Ganges but to the Yamunī.  Kosambī is identified with the two villages of Kosam on the Jumna, about ninety miles west of Allahabad.  (CAGI.448f; Vincent Smith places it further south, J.R.A.S.1898, 503ff).[/p]</entry>

Kokālika (Kokāliya) Sutta (See Kokālika 2).-The story of Kokālika - according to Buddhaghosa (SnA.ii.473), to be distinguished as Cūla Kokālika.  It contains the verses preached by the Buddha to Kokālika.  The verses describe the evil of back-biting and the terrors that await the back-biter after death.  The Sutta Nipāta contains twenty-two verses (657-78).  The Sutta Nipāta Commentary says (p.477f) that the last two stanzas are not explained in the Mahā Atthakathā, and that therefore they did not belong to the original sutta.  Of the remaining twenty the last fourteen (663-76) are called by Buddhaghosa the Turitavatthugāthā, and he says that they were uttered by Moggallāna as Kokālika lay dying, by way of admonition, and that, according to others, Mahā Brahma was the speaker.  The first three stanzas (658-60) are, in the Samyutta Nikāya (i.149), attributed to Tudu.  In the Anguttara Nikāya (v.171-4; the verses are also found in A.ii.3 and in S.i.149ff; Netti.132), also, Tudu speaks them; but according to this version the Buddha repeats them.[/p][p][/p][p]2.

A monk questions the Buddha on the duration of suffering in the Paduma-niraya, and the Buddha proceeds to instruct him by means of various illustrations.

  <entry>[div class="huge"]Konāgamana (Konāgamana)[/div][p]The twenty-third in the list of the twenty-four Buddhas and the second Buddha to be born in the Bhaddakappa.  He was born in the Subhagavatī Park in Sobhavatī, the capital of King Sobha, his father being the brahmin Yaññadatta and his mother Uttarā.  He lived in the household for three thousand years, in three palaces, Tusita, Santusita and Santuttha; his chief wife was Rucigattā and their son was Satthavāha.  Konāgamana left the world on an elephant and practised austerities only for six months, at the end of which time he was given milk-rice by the daughter of the brahmin Aggisoma and grass for his seat by the yavapālaka Tinduka.  His Bodhi was an Udumbara tree.  His first sermon was preached in the Migadāya near Sudassana-nagara, at the foot of a Mahā-sāla tree.  He held only one assembly of his disciples, who numbered thirty thousand.  His body was thirty cubits in height.  He died in the Pabbatārāma at the age of thirty thousand.  His relics were scattered.  His chief disciples were Bhīyya and Uttara among monks, and Samuddā and Uttarā among nuns, his constant attendant being Sotthiya.  His chief patrons were Ugga and Somadeva among laymen, and Sīvalā and Sāmā among laywomen.  The Bodhisatta was a khattiya named Pabbata of Mithilā.  He held an almsgiving, heard the Buddha preach and joined the Order.  (D.i.7; Bu.xxiv; BuA.213ff; J.i.42f; according to the Jātaka his body was twenty cubits high; Sp.i.190).

At the conclusion of his sermon, thirty thousand people realised the Truth.  At the Buddha's wish, the nun Kantakānandā (v.l.  Kanakadattā) brought to Ceylon a branch of the Bodhi-tree.  The Buddha also preached at the Ratanamāla, the Sudassanamāla and the Nāgamālaka and gave his girdle for the people's worship.  He left Mahāsumba and Kantakānandā to look after the new converts.[/p][p]In Konāgamana's time Mount Vepulla was known as Vankaka, and the people living on the mountain were called Rohitassā, their term of life being thirty thousand years (S.ii.191).

When Sāmāvatī expressed a desire to see the Buddha, Khujjuttarā suggested that she should pierce holes in the walls of the palace and gaze on the Buddha as he passed along the street.  After the death of Sāmāvatī, Khujjuttarā seems to have spent all her time in religious works, listening to the preaching of the Dhamma.  The Buddha declared her foremost among lay women by reason of her extensive knowledge (bahussutānam).  A.i.26; DhA.i.208ff; AA.i.226, 237f; ItvA.23f.; PsA.498f.[/p][p]Once, in the past, she was a serving-woman of the king of  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/baranasi,Benares')"]Benares[/a], and one day, having seen a  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/pacceka_buddha,Pacceka Buddha')"]Pacceka Buddha[/a] who was slightly hunch-backed, she threw a blanket over her shoulder, and bending down to look like a hunchback, she imitated the Buddha's manner of walking.  Therefore, in this present birth she herself was hunchbacked.  On another occasion eight Pacceka Buddhas, receiving their bowls filled with rice-porridge from the palace, found the bowls so hot that they were obliged to move them from one hand to the other.  Seeing this, Khujjuttarā gave them eight ivory bracelets as stands for their bowls.  It is said that these bracelets are still preserved in the  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/n/nandamulapabbhara,Nandamūla-pabbhāra')"]Nandamūla-pabbhāra[/a].  Because of this act Khujjuttarā obtained profound wisdom in this birth, and was able to learn the Tipitaka by heart.  In the time of Kassapa Buddha she was the daughter of a treasurer, and had a friend who was a nun; one day when she was adorning herself at eventide the nun visited her, and as there was no servant-girl at the time Khujjuttarā asked the nun to do various things for her.  As a result she was born as a slave.  Her desire to become chief among learned lay-women was formed in the time of Padumuttara Buddha, on her seeing a similar rank bestowed on a lay-woman (DhA.i.226f, etc.; Dvy.339-41).[/p][p]It is said that the discourses in the Itivuttaka are those which Khujjuttarā learned from the Buddha and later repeated to Sāmāvatī and her attendant women.  Because these discourses were all preached at Kosambī and repeated there by her, there was no need to specify the place of their preaching; hence the formula "Ekam samayam Bhagavā Kosambiyam viharati" is omitted, and instead is found "vuttam h'etam Bhagavatā arahatā." (ItvA.32).[/p][p]Khujjuttarā is several times mentioned as the paragon among lay-women disciples (E.g., A.i.88; ii.164; iv.368; S.ii.236), and in the Commentaries (E.g., DA.iii.910) she is given as an example of kāmabhoginiyo (women who enjoyed the pleasures of the senses).  She possessed the patisambhidā while yet a householder, but it was the patisambhidā of the probationer (sekha) (Vsm.442; VibhA.388).[/p][p]Khujjuttarā is identified with the slave-girl in the  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/uraga_jat_154_354,Uraga Jātaka')"]Uraga Jātaka[/a] (J.iii.168) and in the [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bhisa_jat_488,Bhisa Jātaka')"]Bhisa Jātaka[/a] (J.iv.314), the nurse in the  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/culla_sutasoma_jat_525,Culla-Sutasoma Jātaka')"]Culla-Sutasoma Jātaka[/a] (J.v.192) and the hunchback in the [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kusa_jat_531,Kusa Jātaka')"]Kusa Jātaka[/a] (J.v.312).

  <entry>[div class="huge"]Kūtadanta Sutta[/div][p]Preached at Khānumata.  Kūtadanta consults the Buddha on the best way of making a sacrifice efficacious, and the Buddha tells him of a sacrifice held in days of yore by King Mahā Vijitāvī, under the guidance of his enlightened purohita.  The sacrifice is undertaken with the co-operation of the four divisions of the king's subjects.  The king has eight personal qualifications, as has his chaplain.  No living thing is injured; all the labour is voluntary and the sacrifice is offered, not only on behalf of the king, but of all the good.  No regrets are felt at any stage of the sacrifice.[/p][p]The Buddha then proceeds to tell Kūtadanta of other forms of "sacrifice" more potent than the gift of material things, and ends the sutta with a description of arahantship.[/p][p]At the conclusion of the discourse Kūtadanta declares himself to be a follower of the Buddha.

They returned and related to the Buddha each the particular excellence attained by him, and one of them asked the Buddha how all these methods could lead to Nibbāna.  The Buddha related a story of the past where four sons of Brahmadatta, king of Benares, having asked their charioteer to show them a kimsuka-tree, are shown the tree at four different times: when the buds were just sprouting, when the leaves were green, at the time of blossoming, and at the time of fruit-bearing.[/p][p]When asked to describe the tree, the first likened it to a burnt stump, the second to a banyan tree, the third to a piece of meat, and the fourth to an acacia.

It is sixty leagues in breadth, and Ālavaka, on his way to his house, having heard to his great anger that the Buddha was there, placed his left foot on Manosilātala and his right on Kelāsakūta.  The touch of his foot sent pieces of the rock flying, and his shout "I am Ālavaka" was heard throughout Jambudīpa (SNA.i.223; SA.i.248).[/p][p]Kelāsa is often used in similes to describe an object that is perfectly white (E.g., J.iv.232; vi.490, 515; the horse Kanthaka, Mbv.26; DhA.i.192; Cv.lxxiii.114), very stately (E.g., an elephant's head or a big building, J.i.321; v.52, 53; Cv.lxxviii.77), or difficult to destroy (E.g., J.v.39).[/p][p]In the Mahāvastu (ii.97, 109; see also iii.309, 438), Kailāsa is mentioned as the abode of the Kinnaras.

  <entry>[div class="huge"]Khantivādī Jātaka (No.313)[/div][p]The Bodhisatta, under the name of Kundaka, was once born in a very rich family of Kāsī.  After the death of his parents he gave away his immense wealth in charity and became an ascetic in the Himālaya.  Returning later to Kāsī, he dwelt in the royal park, being tended by the commander-in-chief.  One day Kalābu, king of Benares, visited the park with his harem and, falling into a drunken sleep, left the women to their own devices; they, wandering about and meeting the ascetic, asked him to preach to them.  When the king woke he sought his women, and seeing the ascetic and being told that he had been preaching on patience (khanti), he gave orders that the ascetic's own patience be tested.  The ascetic was subjected to various forms of ill-treatment until, becoming more and more angry at his composure, the king gave orders for him to be tortured by the cutting off of his limbs.  As the king left the park the earth opened and he was swallowed in Avīci.  The commander-in-chief, hearing what had happened, hurried off to the ascetic to ask forgiveness.  The ascetic declared that he bore no malice, and died of his injuries with a blessing to the king on his lips.  It is told by some that he went back to the Himālaya.[/p][p]The story was related at Jetavana in reference to a wrathful monk (J.iii.39-43).  Kalābu was Devadatta and the commander-in-chief, Sāriputta.[/p][p]The Jātaka is frequently mentioned as an example of supreme forgiveness, the ascetic being referred to as Khantivādī (E.g., DhA.i.126; KhpA.149; J.i.46; iii.178; vi.257; BuA.51).  The Jātaka further illustrates how a man's anger can grow towards an unoffending victim (J.iv.11), and how an angry man loses all his prosperity (J.v.113, 119).[/p][hr][p align="center"][b][i]</entry>

While on the way to the forest, Kutumbiyaputta-Tissa weakened in his determination and turned back.  When the rains were over, the others, having won arahantship, returned and reported their various attainments to the Buddha.  Kutumbiyaputta heard the Buddha praise them, and made up his mind to follow their example and so to go back with them the next day to the forest.  That same night, however, filled with a yearning not to delay in beginning his austerities, he slept in an upright posture; but in the middle of the night he fell down and broke his thighbone.

Khara had been a monk in a previous birth, and had once rubbed on his body oil belonging to the Sangha without asking the permission of the monks.  As a result his body was ugly, and his skin coarse and rough and like a "tiled roof." Whenever he wished to frighten anybody his skin would stand up like tiles on a roof.

Kukkutārāma.-A pleasaunce in Pātaliputta.  It was evidently the residence of monks from very early times, probably, for some time, of the Buddha himself.  The Mahāvagga (Vin.i.300) mentions the names of several theras who lived there: Nilavāsi, Sānavāsi, Gopaka, Bhagu, Phalikasandana.  The Samyutta Nikāya (S.v.15f; 171f) records several discussions which took place there between Ananda and Bhadda.  It may have been a favourite resort of Ananda, for we find the householder Dasama of Atthakanagara going there to enquire as to his whereabouts (A.v.342; M.i.349).  It was also (probably at a later date) the residence of Nārada who converted King Munda (A.iii.57f), and afterwards of Sonaka, the upajjhāya of Siggava, and of Candavajji, the teacher Mogaliputta-Tissa (Mhv.v.122).  Buddhaghosa mentions (MA.ii.571; AA.ii.866) that the Kukkutarāma was made by Kukkuta Setthi, but gives no further particulars.  Here there is probably some confusion with the ārāma of the same name at Kosambī.  Hiouen Thsang (Beal: op.  cit.ii, 95) says that the Kukkutārāma was to the southeast of the old city of Pātaliputta and was built by Asoka when he first became a convert to the Buddha's religion.  "It was a sort of first-fruit and a pattern of majestic construction." Only the foundation of the building was left at the time of Hiouen Thsang's visit.  It is probable that this account refers to the Asokārāma which Asoka built as the first of his Buddhist structures, and that the Asokārāma was constructed on the site of the old Kukkutārāma.  It is significant that the Pāli books, in recording Asoka's doings, make no mention of a Kukkutārāma existing in his time, though the Sanskrit texts, the Divyāvadāna (E.g., pp.381f, 430ff; see also Smith: Asoka, 183, 193f), for instance, makes frequent reference to it.  If the conjecture made above, namely that the Asokārāma replaced the Kukkutārāma, be correct, it may have been that the place was known by both names in Asoka's time.[/p][p][/p][p]3.

The country thus became very prosperous and its people happy.  In the kingdom of Kalinga there was a drought and consequent scarcity of food.  The king, acting on the advice of his ministers, sent brahmins to beg from the Bodhisatta the loan of his state elephant, Añjanavasabha, who was reported to bring rain.  The elephant was lent willingly but no rain fell.  It was thereupon decided that the prosperity of the Kurus was due to the Kurudhamma observed by the king and the others, and messengers were despatched to find out which these Kurudhammas were.  From the king down to the courtesan, all had rigorously kept them, but each had unwittingly done something which he or she considered a violation of the dhamma.  The messengers, therefore, had to visit each one and take down a list of the dhamma.

  <entry>[div class="huge"]Kharaputta Jātaka (No.386)[/div][p]Once Senaka, king of Benares, saved a Nāga-king from being beaten to death by village lads, and the Nāga in gratitude gave the king many gifts, including a Nāga maiden to minister to him, and a charm by which he might trace her if ever she went out of his sight.  One day the king went with her to the park, and there Senaka found her making love to a water-snake and struck her with a bamboo.  She went to the Nāga-world and complained that she had been ill-treated.  The Nāga-king sent four attendants to kill Senaka, but they, overhearing the king relating the story to his queen, reported the matter to the Nāga-king.  The latter confessed his error to Senaka, and in order to make amends taught him a charm which gave him the knowledge of all sounds.  Senaka was told that if he taught anyone else the charm he would perish in flames.  Senaka's queen discovered his possession of the charm, and did not cease to beg him to teach it to her, even though she knew that by so doing he would incur death.  Unable to resist her, Senaka went with his queen to the park to teach her the charm and enter the flames.  Sakka's throne was heated, and transforming himself and his wife into goats they waited for the king, and on the approach of his chariot began to make love.  The steeds in the chariot were shocked and upbraided the goats for their stupidity, but the goats replied that the steeds were stupid to let themselves be fastened to a chariot which carried so stupid a king as Senaka.  The king, hearing their conversation, alighted from the chariot and, sending the queen on, asked of Sakka how he could evade his promise.  Sakka suggested that the queen be told that she would receive one hundred lashes as part of her initiation.  The queen agreed to this, but, when the flogging started, wished to change her mind, but the king, remembering her selfishness, caused the flogging to be carried out.[/p][p][/p][p]The story was related concerning a monk who was tempted by his former wife.  Senaka was identified with the monk; Sāriputta was the chief steed and Sakka the Bodhisatta (J.iii.275ff).[/p][p]One of the verses in the Jātaka occurs also in the Mahāsutasoma Jātaka.

She was married to Bimbisāra, and a village in Kāsi was given to her for bath-money as part of her dowry.  She was the mother of Ajātasattu.  (Ajātasattu is called Videhiputta).  When pregnant with him, she was filled with a desire to drink blood from the right knee of her husband, and on learning from the astrologers that this presaged the birth of a patricide, she went to the park-called, on that account, Maddakucchi (q.v.) - and tried to bring about an abortion, but failed.  Bimbisāra satisfied her longing.  When Bimbisāra was imprisoned by Ajātasattu she waited upon him, taking him food till she was absolutely prevented from doing so.

  <entry>[div class="huge"]Kisāgotamī [/div][hr][p]1. Kisāgotamī Therī.-An arahant.  She was declared chief among women disciples with respect to the wearing of coarse robes (lūkhacīvara-dharānam) (A.i.25; the DhA.iv.156 contains a story of the Buddha speaking to Sakka the praises of Kisāgotamī).  She came from a poor family in Sāvatthi (of a setthikula, which had fallen on evil days, says the Apadāna p.565, vs.19).  Gotamī was her name - she was called Kisā because of her thinness.  She was married into a rich family, by whom she was disdainfully treated; but as soon as she bore a son she was shown respect.  [/p][p](Except by her husband says the Apadāna loc.  cit.20. The DhA.ii.270ff account, however, makes no mention of her ill treatment; on the contrary, it leads us to expect that she should have been greatly esteemed because, prior to her arrival, her father-in-law's wealth, forty crores in amount, had all turned into charcoal.  When she touched the charcoal it once more became gold.  This account is found also in SA.i.149).[/p][p]The boy, however, died when just old enough to run about; his mother, distraught with grief, fearful lest the dead child should be taken from her, went about with him on her hip, seeking medicine to revive his life.  People laughed at her, until one wise man, realizing her condition, directed her to the Buddha.  The Buddha asked her to bring him a mustard seed from a house where no one had yet died.  In the course of her search for the impossible her frenzy left her, and having grasped the truth, she laid the child in the charnel field, and returning to the Master begged admission to the Order.  She became a Sotāpanna, and soon after, when her insight was developed, the Buddha appeared before her in a blaze of radiance and, listening to his words, she became an arahant.  (ThigA.174ff; Ap.ii.564f; DhA.i.270ff; AA.i.205).[/p][p]In the verses ascribed to her in the Therīgāthā (vv.213-23), she incorporates the story of Patācārā in her own psalm, as though to utter more fully the pageant and tragedy inherent in woman's lot, whereof her own sorrow was but a phase.[/p][p]In the time of Padumuttara Buddha she was a householder's daughter in Hamsavatī, and having heard the Buddha assign to a bhikkhunī the foremost rank among wearers of coarse robes, she vowed that one day the same rank should be her's.[/p][p]In the time of Kassapa Buddha she was the fifth daughter of Kikī and her name was Dhammā.  Then she entered the Order and lived a celibate life (Ap.ii.564f; ThigA.190f).  She is identified with the lizard in the Tittira Jātaka (J.iii.543).[/p][p]The Samyutta Nikāya (i.129f) records a visit paid to her by Māra as she sat resting in Andhavana.

She saw from her balcony Siddhattha Gotama returning in his chariot to his palace on receipt of the news that a son had been born to him.  Gotamī was gladdened by the sight of him, and gave vent to her exultation in the famous "nibbutā-pada" (nibuttā nūna sā mātā, etc.).[/p][p]Gotama was pleased by the mention of the word nibbuta, which to him meant deliverance, and as a mark of his gratitude sent her the necklace of pearls which he wore, worth one hundred thousand.  She accepted it gladly as a token of his love (J.i.60f; BuA.232f).  She is sometimes spoken of as a cousin of Gotama, his father's brother's daughter (pitucchādhītā).  (E.g., DhA.i.70; DhSA.34.

Kokālika (Kokāliya) Sutta (See Kokālika 2).-The story of Kokālika - according to Buddhaghosa (SnA.ii.473), to be distinguished as Cūla Kokālika.  It contains the verses preached by the Buddha to Kokālika.  The verses describe the evil of back-biting and the terrors that await the back-biter after death.  The Sutta Nipāta contains twenty-two verses (657-78).  The Sutta Nipāta Commentary says (p.477f) that the last two stanzas are not explained in the Mahā Atthakathā, and that therefore they did not belong to the original sutta.  Of the remaining twenty the last fourteen (663-76) are called by Buddhaghosa the Turitavatthugāthā, and he says that they were uttered by Moggallāna as Kokālika lay dying, by way of admonition, and that, according to others, Mahā Brahma was the speaker.  The first three stanzas (658-60) are, in the Samyutta Nikāya (i.149), attributed to Tudu.  In the Anguttara Nikāya (v.171-4; the verses are also found in A.ii.3 and in S.i.149ff; Netti.132), also, Tudu speaks them; but according to this version the Buddha repeats them.[/p][p][/p][p]2. Kokālika Sutta.-Gives the story of Kokālika (2) speaking ill of Sāriputta and Moggallāna before the Buddha, of Kokālika's illness and death, of his admonition by Tudu, and of the announcement of his death and subsequent birth in the Paduma-niraya by Sahampatī to the Buddha.  A monk questions the Buddha on the duration of suffering in the Paduma-niraya, and the Buddha proceeds to instruct him by means of various illustrations.  The sutta ends with the repetition by the Buddha of Tudu's verses.  A.v.171-4; also S.i.149ff.[/p][p][/p][p]3.

He entered the Order under Ananda, after the Buddha's death, and in due course won arahantship.  At the First Council held in the Sattapanni Cave, he was sent to bring Ananda to the Assembly.  He travelled through the earth, gave the message to Ananda, and returning through the air announced his arrival to the Sangha, through the medium-ship of a devatā who had been placed at the door of the cave to ward off Māra and his followers.  Sobhita was called "Khujja" because he was slightly hunchbacked.[/p][p][/p][p]In the time of Padumuttara he saw the Buddha passing with a large assembly of monks and praised him in ten stanzas (Thag.234-6; ThagA.i.350f).[/p][p]He is probably identical with Sayampatibhāniya of the Apadāna.  Ap.ii.410f.[/p][hr][p][b]2. Khujjasobhita Thera.[/b]-One of the Pācīnaka ("Eastern") monks who proclaimed the ten indulgences at Vesāli.  He was one of their representatives on the Committee of the Sangha appointed to settle the dispute between the monks of Vesāli and the orthodox monks (Vin.ii.305; Dpv.iv.44; v.25, 80).  [/p][p][/p][p]According to the Mahāvamsa (iv.57; this passage is also found in the Samantapāsādikā i.34) this Khujjasobhita was a disciple of Ananda and, therefore, to be identified with Khujjasobhita (1).  The latter was, how-ever, an arahant, and therefore not likely to side with the Vesāli heretics.

  <entry>[div class="huge"]Khemā [/div][hr][p]1. Khemā Therī.-An arahant, chief of the Buddha's women disciples.  She was born in a ruling family at Sāgala in the Madda country, and her skin was of the colour of gold.  She became the chief consort of King Bimbisāra.  She would not visit the Buddha who was at Veluvana, lest he should speak disparagingly of her beauty with which she was infatuated.  The king bade poets sing the glories of Veluvana and persuaded Khemā to go there.  She was then brought face to face with the Buddha, and he conjured up, for her to see, a woman like a celestial nymph who stood facing him.  Even as Khemā gazed on the nymph, whose extraordinary beauty far excelled her own, she saw her pass gradually from youth to extreme old age, and so fall down in the swoon of death.  Seeing that Khemā was filled with dismay at the sight, the Buddha preached to her on the vanity of lust, and we are told that at that moment she attained arahantship.  With the consent of Bimbisāra she entered the Order, and was ranked by the Buddha foremost among his women disciples for her great insight (mahāpaññānam aggā) (A.i.25; Dpv.xviii.9; see also MA.iv.168f.; Bu.xxvi.19; J.i.15,16).[/p][p]In the time of Padumuttara she was a slave, and having seen the Buddha's chief disciple, Sujāta, gave him three cakes, and that same day she sold her hair and gave him alms.[/p][p]In Kassapa Buddha's time she became the eldest daughter of Kikī, king of Benares, and was named Samanī.  With her sisters she observed celibacy for twenty thousand years and built a monastery for the Buddha.  She learnt the Mahānidāna Sutta, having heard the Buddha preach it.  In the time of Vipassī she became a renowned preacher of the Dhamma, and during the time of both Kakusandha and Konāgamana she had great monasteries built for the Buddha and his monks.

He questioned her as to whether or not the Buddha existed after death.  She explained the matter to him in various ways, and Pasenadi, delighted with her exposition, related it to the Buddha (S.iv.374ff).  She is mentioned in several places (E.g., A.i.88; ii.164; iv.347; S.ii.236) as the highest ideal of womanhood worthy of imitation, and is described as the nun par excellence.[/p][p]Khemā is identified with the mother in the Uraga Jātaka (J.iii.168), the queen in the Rohantamiga (J.iv.423) and in the Hamsa (J.iv.430), the queen, Khemā, in the Mahāhamsa (J.v.382), and the princess in the Mahājanaka (J.vi.68).[/p][p][/p][p]2.

He was wise and learned and clever in device; the king followed his counsel and conquered all the territories of India except that of King Videha in Mithilā (J.vi.391-5).  When at last Brahmadatta laid siege to Mithilā, Kevatta was responsible for the details of the siege, but his plans were upset by Mahosadha, who, though his junior in age, was far wiser.  At one stage of the struggle Kevatta suggested that a trial of intellect be arranged between him and Mahosadha, the result of the conquest to decide the victory of Brahmadatta or Videha.  The challenge was accepted, but Mahosadha, by a ruse, made Kevatta appear as though paying obeisance to him and rubbed Kevatta's head in the dust, bruising it.  After the return, in disgrace, of Brahmadatta to Uttarapañcāla, Kevatta meditated revenge through the instrumentality of Pañcāla-candī.  Kevatta visited Mithilā with a proposal that Videha should go to Uttarapañcāla and marry Pañcālacandī.  During this visit, Kevatta went to visit Mahosadha, but the latter, guessing that the whole thing was a plot to kill Videha, refused to see Kevatta and caused him to be ill-treated (J.vi.400-19).

He spent his time with the heads of the other twenty-nine families in the village, engaged in various forms of social service.  The headman, finding his gains diminish, made a false report to the king, who ordered Magha and his friends to be trampled by elephants; but by virtue of their mettā they could not be killed, and thereupon the king showed them great favour.  After death they were all born in Tāvatimsa, with Magha as Sakka.  [/p][p][/p][p]Three of Magha's wives - Sudhammā, Cittā and Nandā - who had persuaded him to let them share in his good work, were born as Sakka's handmaidens.  But Sujātā, who had taken no part in their activities, received no such honour.  At that time the Asuras shared Tāvatimsa with the Devas, but one day they got drunk and were hurled down to the foot of Sineru.  They therefore declared war on the Devas, and during one of their fierce battles Sakka was defeated and fled over the sea in his chariot Vejayanta.  When he came to Simbalivana, the chariot felled down the trees there, and the young Garulas were hurled into the sea.  Hearing their cries of agony, Sakka made his driver, Mātali, turn the chariot and go back.  The Asuras, seeing him return, thought it was another Sakka coming with reinforcements, and fled in terror.  The Vejayanta-pāsāda rose from the earth, and Sakka lived in it, having fortified his city with a fivefold guard.[/p][p][/p][p]The story was told in reference to a monk who had drunk water without first straining it, because his friend, with whom he was travelling and with whom he had fallen out, had the only strainer available.  Mātali is identified with Ananda (J.i.198ff; with the introductory story cp.  Vin.ii.118).[/p][p][/p][p]In the version given in the Dhammapada Commentary (i.263ff; see also SA.i.260f; DA.iii.710ff; and SNA.ii.484f; according to these accounts Sakka was helped by not 29 but 33 others), the story of Magha is related in response to a question asked of the Buddha by the Licchavi Mahāli.  The reason given for Sakka's flight in the Vejayantaratha also differs.  According to this account, when Sujātā (q.v.) was reborn as the daughter of Vepacitti and the time came for her to choose a husband, Sakka went to the assembly in the guise of an aged Asura and was chosen by Sujātā.  Sakka thereupon revealed himself and fled with his bride in the chariot, the Asuras in full chase.[/p][p]See also Kulāvaka Sutta.[/p]</entry>

  <entry>[div class="huge"]Kotisanthāra[/div][p]In the Jātakas mention is made (E.g., J.iii.18; 375, 397; J.iv.113) of the Buddha when he wished to address the monks of Jetavana, asking Ananda to summon them to the Kotisanthāra and ordering that a seat be prepared for him at the entrance to the Gandhakuti.  [/p][p][/p][p]Kotisanthāra was probably the name given to that part of the Jetavana grounds just outside the Buddha's own apartments.  It may have been so called in reference to the fact that Anāthapindika bought the land by spreading on it a crore of kahāpanas (kahāpana-koti-santhārena) (J.i.94).  Or the name may have been restricted to the part actually covered by the pieces of money, for we are told (Vin.ii.159) that the money was not sufficient to cover the whole of the ground.[/p][p][/p][p]There were buildings in the Kotisanthāra, the monks living in these buildings being referred to as "Antokotisanthāre vasantā." (E.g., J.iv.113) [/p][p][/p][p]Kotisanthāra is generally translated as The Golden Pavement, (E.g., Jāt.  Trs.iii.12; iv.71) which seems to be a wrong rendering.[/p]</entry>
  <entry>[div class="huge"]Kuru[/div][p]A country, one of the sixteen Mahājanapadas (D.ii.200; A.i.213 etc.).  Frequent references to it are found in the Pāli Canon.  It is said that Kuru was originally the name of the chieftains (rājakumārā) of the country and that their territory was later named after them.  Buddhaghosa records a tradition (DA.ii.481f; MA.i.184 etc.) which states that, when Mandhātā returned to Jambudīpa from his sojourn in the four Mahādīpas and in the devalokas, there were in his retinue a large number of the people of Uttarakuru.  They settled down in Jambudīpa, and their settlement was known as Kururattha.  It had many towns and villages.[/p][p]The country seems to have had very little political influence in the Buddha's time, though, in the past, Pañcāla, Kuru and Kekaka were evidently three of the most powerful kingdoms (See, e.g., J.ii.214).  According to the Jātakas (E.g., J.v.57, 484; vi.255. Also Mtu.i.34; ii.419), the kingdom of Kuru was three hundred leagues in extent and its capital, Indapatta, seven leagues in circumference.  The ruling dynasty at Indapatta belonged to the Yudhitthila-gotta (J.iii.400; iv.361).  Among the kings of the past, Dhanañjaya Koravya is mentioned several times (J.ii.366; iii.400; iv.450; vi.260 etc.) and reference is also made to a king called Koravya (J.iv.361; v.457) whose son was the Bodhisatta Sutasoma.  During the Buddha's time, also, the chieftain of Kuru was called Koravya, and his discussion with the Elder Ratthapāla, who was himself the scion of a noble family of the Kurus, is recounted in the Ratthapāla Sutta (M.ii.65ff).  Perhaps at one time the Kuru kingdom extended as far as Uttarapañcāla, for in the Somanassa Jātaka (J.iv.444), Uttarapañcāla is mentioned as a town in the Kururattha, with Renu as its king.[/p][p]Koravya had a park called Migācīra where Ratthapāla took up his residence when he visited his parents (MA.ii.725).  The people of Kuru had a reputation for deep wisdom and good health, and this reputation is mentioned (MA.i.184f; AA.ii.820; they were also probably reputed to be virtuous; see the Kurudhamma Jātaka) as the reason for the Buddha having delivered some of his most profound discourses to the Kurus, for example, the Mahānidāna, and the Mahāsatipatthāna Suttas.  Among other discourses delivered in the Kuru country are the Māgandiya Sutta, the Anañjasappāya Sutta, the Sammosa Sutta and the Ariyavasā Sutta.  All these were preached at Kammāssadhamma, which is described as a nigama of the Kurūs, where the Buddha resided from time to time.  Another town of the Kurūs, which we find mentioned, is Thullakotthika, the birthplace of Ratthapāla, and here the Buddha stayed during a tour (M.ii.54; ThagA.ii.30).  Udena's queen, Māgandiyā, came from Kuru (DhA.i.199), and Aggidatta, chaplain to the Kosala king, lived on the boundary between Kuru and Ariga and Magadha, honoured by the inhabitants of all three kingdoms (DhA.iii.242).[/p][p]The Kuru country is generally identified as the district around Thānesar, with its capital Indapatta, near the modern Delhi (CAGI.379f).  See also Uttarakuru.[/p]</entry>

[/p][p]The Commentary (SNA.i.46ff) divides the sutta into four vaggas and gives each a separate name (except the first), the name being generally derived from the first word of the stanza.

It is, however, only in the case of a few Pacceka Buddhas that the actual names are given - e.g., [/p][ul][li]Brahmadatta (v.33), [/li][li]Anitthigandha (36), [/li][li]Mahāpaduma (39), [/li][li]Ekavajjika-Brahmadatta (40), [/li][li]Ekaputtika-Brahmadatta (41), [/li][li]Cātumāsika-Brahma-datta (44, 64), [/li][li]Sītāluka-Brahmadatta (52), [/li][li]Suta-Brahmadatta (58), [/li][li]Vibhūsaka-Brahmadatta (59), [/li][li]Pādalola-Brahmadatta (61), [/li][li]Anivatta-Brahmadatta (62), [/li][li]Cakkhulola-Brahmadatta (63),[/li][li]Mātanga (74).[/li][/ul][p]The rest are described as "the king of Benares," or "the son of the king," etc.[/p][p]The sutta is commented on in the Culla-Niddesa (pp.56ff), in addition to those of the Parāyanavagga, an evidence of the fact that, when the Culla-Niddesa was composed, this was probably regarded as an independent sutta, not belonging to any particular group such as the Uragavagga, and that the comments on it were written at a time prior to the composition of the Sutta Nipāta as an anthology in its present form.  This view is further strengthened by the fact that its mixed Sanskrit version in the Mahāvastu (i.357f) is not placed in any definite group.  According to the Mahāvastu, the Pratyeka Buddhas, five hundred in number, were living in Rsipatana near Benares, and when they heard from the Suddhāvāsa devas of the approach of the Buddha in twelve years, they disappeared from Rsipatana, each repeating one of the verses of the sutta.[/p][p]The Apadāna (i.7ff) includes the stanzas of the Khaggavisāna Sutta in its chapter called the Pacceka-buddhāpadāna and prefaces them with several introductory stanzas.  A few stanzas are also added at the end by way of conclusion.  In its exegesis the Apadāna Commentary (ApA.i.106f) gives the names of several Pacceka Buddhas.  They are, however, different from those given by Buddhaghosa, and correspond more nearly to those mentioned in the  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/i_/isigili_s,Isigili Sutta')"]Isigili Sutta[/a].[/p]</entry>

Among such visitors are mentioned several Licchavi chiefs, Mahāli Otthatthaddha (D.i.150ff; S.i.230f; iii.68f; A.v.86f; several visits of Mahāli are mentioned; for details see Mahāli.  BuA.  p.3 mentions that the Buddha spent his sixth rainy season in the Kūtāgārasālā), Nandaka (S.v.389), Sunakkhatta (M.ii.252), Bhaddiya (A.ii.190f), Sālha and Abhaya (A.ii.200), all attended by numerous retinues; their senāpati, Sīha, who went with five hundred chariots, having only decided after much hesitation to see the Buddha (A iii.38f; iv.79, 179ff); the Jaina Saccaka, whom the Buddha won only after much argumentation, as described in the Cūla- and the Mahā-Saccaka Suttas (M.i.227ff; 237ff; the Licchavi Dummukha is also mentioned, M.i.234, as having been present when Saccaka argued with the Buddha); the householder Ugga of Vesāli, acclaimed by the Buddha for the possession of eight eminent qualities (A.iii.49; iv.208f; S.iv.109); the upāsaka Vāsettha (A.iv.258f), the two goddesses, daughters of Pajjunna, both known as Kokanadā (S.i.29f ); and the brahmin Pingiyāni (A.iii.237f).[/p][p][/p][p]The Licchavis waited on the Buddha and ministered to him during his stay in the Kūtāgārasālā, and it is said that they were of various hues: some blue, others yellow, etc.  And Pingiyānī, seeing the Buddha shining in their midst, surpassing them all, once uttered the Buddha's praises in verse, winning, as reward from the Licchavis, five hundred upper garments, all of which, be, in turn, presented to the Buddha (A.iii.239f).  On one occasion, when the Buddha was preaching to the monks regarding the six spheres of sense contact, Māra arranged an earthquake to break the monks' concentration, but failed to achieve his object (S.i.112).  Several Jātakas were related by the Buddha in the Kūtāgārasālā: the Sigāla (J.ii.5), the Telovāda (J.ii.262), the Bāhiya (J.i.420), and the Ekapanna (J.i.504).  It was here that the Buddha finally agreed to grant the request of the five hundred Sākyan women, led by Pajāpatī Gotamī, that they might be ordained as nuns.  They had followed the Buddha hither from Kapilavatthu (A.iv.274f; Vin.ii.253f; J.ii.392).  The Buddha gave Pajāpatī Gotamī, at her special request, a summary of his doctrine (A.iv.280).  It was also at the Kūtāgārasālā that the Buddha uttered his prophecy as to the ultimate downfall of-the Licchavis (S.ii.267f).[/p][p][/p][p]It was customary for the Buddha, when staying at the Kūtāgārasālā, to spend the noonday siesta in the woods outside the Mahāvana, at the foot of a tree; visitors coming at that time would, if their desire to see him was insistent (see, e.g., D.i.151; A.iii.75), seek him there or be conducted to him.  Sometimes he would express his desire to see no one during such a retreat, except the monk who brought him his food.[/p][p]On one occasion the retreat lasted a fortnight, and on his return he found that a large number of monks had committed suicide as a result of a sermon he had preached to them before his retreat on the un-loveliness of the body.  He then caused the monks to be assembled, and asked them to concentrate on breathing (S.v.320f).  Sometimes the Buddha would walk from the Kūtāgārasālā to places of interest in the neighbourhood - e.g., the Sārandada-cetiya (A.iii.167) and the Cāpāla-cetiya (S.v.258; A.iv.308f).  It was from the Cāpāla-cetiya, during one of these walks that he gazed for the last time on Vesāli.  He then returned to the Kūtāgārasālā, where he announced that his death would take place within three months (D.ii.119f; S.v.258ff).[/p][p][/p][p]According to Buddhaghosa (DA.i.310; MA.i.450), there was a monastery (sanghārāma) built for the monks in the Mahāvana.  Part of it consisted of a storeyed house, with a hall below surrounded only by pillars.  These pillars held the gabled room which formed the main part of the Buddha's Gandha-kuti there.  The hall lay from north to south and faced east (DA.i.311), and from this hall the whole monastery came to be known as the Kūtāgārasālā.  There was a sick ward attached to the monastery, where the Buddha would often visit the patients and talk with them (E.g., S.iv.210f; A.iii.142).[/p][p]The books also contain the names of others who stayed at the Kūtāgārasālā when the Buddha was in residence - e.g., Ananda, who was visited there by the Licchavis Abhaya and Panditakumāra (A.i.220); Anuruddha, who lived there in a forest hut (S.iii.116; iv.380); Nāgita, the Buddha's former attendant, and Nāgita's nephew the novice Sīha (D.i.151); also Cāla, Upacāla, Kakkata, Kalimbha, Nikata, and Katissaha, all of whom left the Kūtāgārasālā and retired to the Gosingasālavana, when the visits of the Licchavis to the Buddha became disturbing to their solitude (A.v.133f).[/p][p][/p][p]In later times Yasa Kākandakaputta is mentioned as having stayed there (Sp.i.34; Mhv.iv.12; Dpv.v.29).[/p][p]Eighteen thousand monks under Mahā-Buddharakkhita went from the monastery in Mahāvana in Vesāli to the foundation ceremony of the Mahā Thūpa (Mhv.xxix.33).[/p][p][/p][p]According to the Northern books (Dvy.136, 200; AvS.8; Mtu.i.300), the Kūtāgārasālā was on the banks of the lake Markatā (Markatahradatīre).[/p]</entry>

Kesi visits the Buddlia, and in answer to a question says that he trains some horses by mildness, some by harshness, and others by both; those which do not submit to his training he destroys.  The Buddha says that just so does he deal with men.  Some he tames by mildness - telling them what is good and showing them the way to heaven; others by harshness - condemning the evils in them; yet others by both.  Those who do not submit to this discipline he destroys, by refusing to admonish them (A.ii.112f).[/p][p]Buddhaghosa says (Sp.i.120) that the Kesi Sutta should be one of those used to explain the term purisadamma-sārathī in reference to the Buddha.[/p]</entry>

  <entry>[div class="huge"]Kosala-devī[/div][p]Daughter of Mahā Kosala and sister of Pasenadi.  She was married to Bimbisāra, and a village in Kāsi was given to her for bath-money as part of her dowry.  She was the mother of Ajātasattu.  (Ajātasattu is called Videhiputta).  When pregnant with him, she was filled with a desire to drink blood from the right knee of her husband, and on learning from the astrologers that this presaged the birth of a patricide, she went to the park-called, on that account, Maddakucchi (q.v.) - and tried to bring about an abortion, but failed.  Bimbisāra satisfied her longing.  When Bimbisāra was imprisoned by Ajātasattu she waited upon him, taking him food till she was absolutely prevented from doing so.  After his death she died of grief, and Pasenadi made war on Ajātasattu to avenge her death.  J.ii.237; 403; iii.121f.[/p]</entry>
  <entry>[div class="huge"]Kitāgiri (v.l.  Kītāgiri)[/div][p]A village of the Kāsis, on the road from Kāsi to Sāvatthi.  It was the headquarters of the followers of Assaji and Punabbasu, who lived there, behaving in a shameless and wicked manner.  A certain monk, on his way to Jetavana, passed through the place and was asked by a pious layman to complain to the Buddha of their ill-behaviour.  On hearing of it, the Buddha sent Sāriputta and Moggallāna to proclaim on them an act of banishment.  (J.ii.387; Vin.ii.9f; iii.179f; DhA.ii.108f).  Some time after, when the Buddha visited the place with a large company of monks, including Sāriputta and Moggallāna, the Assajipunabbasukā, were asked to provide lodgings for the visitors.  They agreed to do so for the Buddha, but would have nothing to do with Sāriputta and Moggallāna (Vin.ii.171).[/p][p][/p][p]According to Buddhaghosa (MA.ii.668), Kitāgiri was the name of a nigama (township).  In the Samantapāsādikā (iii.613f) it is called a janapada, favoured by adequate rain and fruitful crops, and therefore chosen by the Assaji-Punabbasukas.[/p]</entry>
  <entry>[div class="huge"]Kūtavānija Jātaka (No.  98).[/div][hr][p]1. Kūtavānija Jātaka (No.  98).-The Bodhisatta was once a merchant named Pandita and entered into partnership with a dishonest man, Atipandita.  When the time came for dividing the profits the latter claimed a larger share, for he, as his name showed, was the "brains" of the business.  To settle the dispute he hid his father in a hollow tree, and feigning to consult a Tree-sprite, referred the matter to the Tree.  Pandita suspecting the ruse, lighted a fire at the foot of the tree and thus exposed the cheat.[/p][p]The story was related in reference to a cheating merchant of Sāvatthi, who is identified with Atipandita.  He tried to rob his honest partner, always putting off his claims, in the hope that he would die from the hardships suffered in a long journey they had undertaken for trade.  J.i.404f[/p][hr][p]2. Kūtavānija Jātaka (No.218).-A villager once deposited five hundred ploughshares with a friend in the town, but when he came to claim them, he was told that they had been eaten by mice, and was shown the dung the mice had left behind.  Some time later the villager took his friend's son to bathe, hid him in a house, and reported to the townsman that the boy had been carried off by a hawk.  When he was taken before the judge, who was the Bodhisatta, he protested that in a place where mice ate ploughshares a hawk could easily carry off a boy.  The Bodhisatta settled their dispute (J.ii.181ff).[/p][p]The introductory story is similar to that of No.1 above.  [/p]</entry>

One day, while striving after insight, he was caught in the rain and sought shelter in a woodman's hut.  As soon as he sat down there on a mat he became an arahant.  The Buddha, having heard by virtue of his divine ear the conversation between the monk and the watchman, uttered verses of approbation.  The monk was so called because he obtained insight in a hut.[/p][p]In the past he had given cool water to Padumuttara Buddha (Thag.v.56; ThagA.i.129f).[/p][p]He is probably identical with Udakapūjaka Thera of the Apadāna.

He pursued his meditations in a very old hut and had thoughts of building another; but a spirit, seeking his welfare, pointed out to him in words which, though simple, carried a profound meaning, that a new hut would mean new pain.  Thus urged on, Kutivihāri became an arahant.[/p][p]In the past he gave a fan of split reeds to Padumuttara Buddha (Thag.v.57; ThagA.i.130f).

Okkāka has no heir, in spite of performing various rites.  But at length, by the favour of Sakka, Sīlavatī miraculously gives birth to two sons.  The elder, though ill-favoured, is supernaturally wise and is called Kusa.  The younger, very handsome, is called Jayampati.  Kusa consents to marry only on condition that a princess can be obtained exactly like an image which he himself has fashioned.

She leaves him immediately and returns to her father's court.  Thither Kusa follows her, and under a variety of menial disguises, including that of a cook, tries, but in vain, to win her affection.

He sends letters, purporting to come from King Madda, to seven kings, offering Pabhāvatī to each of them.  They arrive in Sāgala simultaneously and threaten to destroy the city.  Madda decides to cut Pabhāvatī into seven pieces, and she is only saved from immediate death by the despised husband.  At his appearance the kings flee, for wherever he looks the earth trembles.  Kusa returns with his wife to Kusāvatī and they live there happily.[/p][p]Pleased at Kusa's victory, Sakka gives him a jewel called the Verocanamani.  It was octagonal, and was evidently handed down in the succession of kings, for we are told that one of the tests, set by Videha, king of Mithilā, to discover the proficiency of Mahosadha, was for him to break the old thread in this gem, remove it, and insert a new one.  (J.vi.340; according to SA.i.115 and DA.iii.266, the jewel was also in the possession of Pasenadi; but see the  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahasara_jat_092,Mahāsāra Jātaka')"]Mahāsāra Jātaka[/a], where no mention is made of Kusa).

A woman, who was the head of a village (gāmapatikā), formed a settlement on a spot indicated by the Yakkha and was guarded by him.  She thus came to be known as Kundiyā, and when, later, the Koliyan nobles built a city on the same spot, the city was known as Kundiya.  In the forest tract the Koliyan nobles built a monastery for the Buddha and his monks.  It was while the Buddha was dwelling in this monastery that Suppavāsā gave birth to Sīvalī, after prolonged labour pains, which only ceased after she received the Buddha's blessing (Ud.ii.8; UdA.122; DhA.iv.192f; J.i.407).

  <entry>[div class="huge"]Koliyā[/div][p]One of the republican clans in the time of the Buddha.  The Koliyā owned two chief settlements - one at Rāmagāma and the other at Devadaha.  The Commentaries (DA.i.260f; SNA.i.356f; A.ii.558; ThagA.i.546; also Ap.i.94) contain accounts of the origin of the Koliyas.  We are told that a king of Benares, named Rāma (the Mtu.i.353 calls him Kola and explains from this the name of the Koliyas), suffered from leprosy, and being detested by the women of the court, he left the kingdom to his eldest son and retired into the forest.  There, living on woodland leaves and fruits, he soon recovered, and, while wandering about, came across Piyā, the eldest of the five daughters of Okkāka, she herself being afflicted with leprosy.  Rāma, having cured her, married her, and they begot thirty-two sons.  With the help of the king of Benares, they built a town in the forest, removing a big kola-tree in doing so.  The city thereupon came to be called Kolanagara, and because the site was discovered on a tiger-track (vyagghapatha) it was also called Vyagghapajjā.  The descendants of the king were known as Koliyā.  [/p][p]According to the Kunālā Jātaka (J.v.413), when the Sākyans wished to abuse the Koliyans, they said that the Koliyans had once "lived like animals in a Kola-tree," as their name signified.  The territories of the Sākiyans and the Koliyans were adjacent, separated by the river Rohinī.  The khattiyas of both tribes intermarried, and both claimed relationship with the Buddha.  (It is said that once the Koliyan youths carried away many Sākiyan maidens while they were bathing, but the Sākiyans, regarding the Koliyans as relatives, took no action; DA.i.262).  A quarrel once arose between the two tribes regarding the right to the waters of the Rohinī, which irrigated the land on both sides, and a bloody feud was averted only by the intervention of the Buddha.  In gratitude, each tribe dedicated some of its young men to the membership of the Order, and during the Buddha's stay in the neighbourhood, he lived alternately in Kapilavatthu and in Koliyanagara.  (For details of this quarrel and its consequences see J.v.412ff; DA.ii.672ff; DhA.iii.254ff).[/p][p]Attached probably to the Koliyan central authorities, was a special body of officials, presumably police, who wore a distinguishing headdress with a drooping crest (Lambacūlakābhatā).  They bore a bad reputation for extortion and violence (S.iv.341).[/p][p]Besides the places already mentioned, several other townships of the Koliyans, visited by the Buddha or by his disciples, are mentioned in literature - e.g., [/p][ul][li]Uttara, the residence of the headman Pātaliya (S.iv.340); [/li][li]Sajjanela, residence of Suppavāsā (A.ii.62); [/li][li]Sāpūga, where Ananda once stayed (A.ii.194); [/li][li]Kakkarapatta, where lived Dīghajānu (A.iv.281); and [/li][li]Haliddavasana, residence of the ascetics Punna Koliyaputta and Seniya (M.i.387; see also S.v.115).

  <entry>[div class="huge"]Keralā[/div][p]The people of Kerala.  The Keralas served as mercenary soldiers to the kings of Ceylon.  They rebelled against Mahinda V.  and governed certain parts of the country (Cv.iv.5, 12).  They fought in the army of Parakkamabāhu I.  against Gajabāhu (Cv.lxix.18; lxx.230).  Later, when Parakkamabāhu's forces were employed in Rohana, the Kerala mercenaries in Kotthasāra conspired with others to capture Rājarattha, but their attempt was foiled (Cv.lxxiv.44f).  The Keralas formed the largest part of Māgha's army which devastated Ceylon, and Māgha gave over to them, for their use, whatever they coveted in the conquered territory.  They overran the country, carrying destruction wherever they went (Cv.lxxx.61, 76; lxxi.4).  Later, however, they suffered severe defeat at the hands of Parakkamabāhu II (Cv.lxxxiii.20).  Once a Pandu king fled from the Cola king and took refuge among the Keralas (Cv.liii.9; Cv.  Trs.i.172, n.3).[/p]</entry>
  <entry>[div class="huge"]Korabya, Koravya, Korabba[/div][p]Perhaps the generic name given to the king of the Kurūs (cf.  Brahmadatta).  Once in the Jātakas Koravya is given as the name of the king of Indapatta in the Kuru country, this king being the father of Sutasoma (J.v.457).  Elsewhere (J.ii.368; iii.400, 402; v.59, 61, 65; vi.256, 268, 273) Koravya appears as a title of Dhanañjaya, king of the Kurūs.  Koravya may also have been used as an adjective, for we find it explained as Kururatthavāsika (E.g., J.vi.273).  The Koravya king probably belonged to the Yudhitthilagotta (See J.iv.361).  The Anguttara Nikāya (iii.369f) mentions a king Koravya who owned a large banyan tree named Suppatittha.  According to the Ratthapāla Sutta (M.ii.65; see also Thag.776.ff; ThagA.ii.34; for details see Ratthapāla), in the Buddha's day, too, the ruler of Kuru was called Koravyarājā, and he owned a park which seems to have been called Migācīra (q.v.).  This king was evidently interested in religious discussion.  Thullakotthika was his capital.  The Avadānasataka (i.67; ii.118; see also Camb.  Hist.  of India, i.121, which refers to a half-mythical Pañcāla king, Kraivya) speaks of a Kauravya of Thullakotthika.[/p]</entry>

I have not been able to trace a sutta of this name.  The Theragāthā Commentary (ThagA.i.380) says that the Buddha visited Bhagu at Bālakalonakagāma after his attainment of arahantship to congratulate him on his solitude (ekavihāram anumoditum).  The Samyutta Commentary (SA.ii.222) goes further and says that the Buddha visited him on the way from Kosambī to Pācīnavamsadāya, and that during this visit the Buddha preached to him the advantages of solitude (ekacāravāse ānisamsam) for the whole day after the midday meal and the whole night (sakalapacchābhattañ c'eva tiyāmarattiñ ca).  The Vinaya passage (Vin.i.350), however, which records this visit does not make mention of any such special sermon, but merely says that the Buddha inquired after Bhagu's health and wellbeing.  v.l.

But when he saw the other rich offerings, he felt that the sprite would never accept so humble a gift and wished to eat the cake himself.  The tree-sprite appeared, took the offering, and revealed to the man that heaps of treasure lay buried under the tree.  The man informed the king of this, and the king, in return, appointed him royal treasurer.[/p][p][/p][p]The story was told in reference to a poor man of Sāvatthi.  Once the people of a whole street in that town pooled their resources in order to entertain the Buddha and his monks to a meal of rice-gruel and cakes.  The poor man, unable to afford anything else, made a bran-cake and by sheer determination put it in the alms-bowl of the Buddha himself.  When it became known that the Buddha had accepted it, people of all classes crowded round the man offering him wealth if he would share with them the merit he had gained.  After consulting with the Buddha, the man accepted the offers, and the gifts he received amounted to nine crores.  That same evening the king appointed him treasurer.  J.i.422f.[/p]</entry>

But the  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddha,Buddha')"]Buddha[/a], by preaching the  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahasudassana_s,Mahā-Sudassana Sutta')"]Mahā-Sudassana Sutta[/a], pointed out to him that in ancient times it had been  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kusaavaatii,Kusāvatī')"]Kusāvatī[/a], the royal city of Mahā-Sudassana (D.ii.146).  Between Kusinārā and  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/pava,Pāvā')"]Pāvā[/a], three gāvutas away (DA.ii.573) - from where the Buddha came to Kusinārā on his last journey from  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/r/raajagaha,Rājagaha')"]Rājagaha[/a], stopping at various places - lay the stream of Kakuttha on the banks of which was the Ambavana; beyond that was the Hiraññavatī river, and near the city, in a south-westerly direction, lay the Upavattana, the Sāla-grove of the Mallas, which the Buddha made his last resting-place (UdA.238; DA.ii.572f).[/p][p]After the Buddha's death his body was carried into the city by the northern gate and out of the city by the eastern gate; to the east of the city was Makutabandhana, the shrine of the Mallas, and there the body was cremated.  For seven days those assembled at the ceremony held a festival in honour of the relics (D.ii.160f).[/p][p]It is said that the Buddha had three reasons for coming to Kusinārā to die: [/p][ul][li](1) Because it was the proper venue for the preaching of the Mahā-Sudassana Sutta; [/li][li](2) because Subhadda would visit him there and, after listening to his sermon, would develop meditation and become an arahant while the Buddha was still alive; and [/li][li](3) because the brahman Doha would be there, after the Buddha's death, to solve the problem of the distribution of his relics (UdA.402f; DA.ii.573f6).  [/li][/ul][p]As the scene of his death, Kusinārā became one of the four holy places declared by the Buddha to be fit places of pilgrimage for the pious, the other three being  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kapilavatthu,Kapilavatthu')"]Kapilavatthu[/a], Buddhagayā and  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/i_/isipatana,Isipatana')"]Isipatana[/a] (D.ii.140).  Mention is made of other visits paid to Kusinārā by the Buddha, prior to that when his death took place.  Thus, once he went there from Āpana and having spent some time at Kusinārā, proceeded to Ātumā.  The Mallas of Kusinārā were always great admirers of the Buddha, even though not all of them were his followers, and on the occasion of this visit they decided that any inhabitant of Kusinārā who failed to go and meet the Buddha and escort him to the city, would be fined five hundred.  It was on this occasion that Roja the Mallan was converted and gave to the Buddha and the monks a supply of green vegetables and pastries (Vin.i.247f).  During some of these visits the Buddha stayed in a wood called Baliharana, and there he preached two of the Kusinārā Suttas (A.i.274f; v.79f) and the "Kinti" Sutta (M.ii.238f).  A third Kusinārā Sutta he preached while staying at Upavattana.  (A.ii.79; for another discourse to some noisy monks at Upavattana, see Ud.iv.2).[/p][p]Kusinārā was the birthplace of Bandhula and his wife Mallikā (DhA.i.338, 349).  It was twenty-five yojanas from Rājagaha (DA.ii.609; acc.  to Fa Hsien, p.40, it was twenty-four yojanas from Kapilavatthu) and lay on the high road from Alaka to Rājagaha, the road taken by Bāvarī's disciples (SN.v.1012).[/p][p]This was evidently the road taken also by Mahā Kassapa from Pāvā, when he came to pay his last respects to the Buddha (Vin.ii.284).[/p][p]According to a late tradition, one-eighth of the Buddha's relics were deposited in a cairn in Kusinārā and honoured by the Mallas (D.ii.167; Bu.xxviii.3).[/p][p]In ancient times Kusinārā was the capital of King Tālissara and twelve of his descendants (Dpv.iii.32).

  <entry>[div class="huge"]Mahā Thūpa [/div][p]The great Thūpa in Anurādhapura, built by Dutthagāmani.  The site on which it was erected was consecrated by the visit of all the four Buddhas of this kappa and was at the upper end of the Kakudhavāpi.  It was one of the spots at which Mahinda scattered campaka flowers by way of homage, and the earth trembled.  When Mahinda informed Devānampiyatissa of the great sanctity of the spot and of its suitability for a Thūpa, Tissa immediately wished to build the Thūpa himself, but Mahinda bade him desist, telling him that the work would be carried out in the future by Dutthagāmani.  Tissa recorded this prophecy on a pillar of stone (Mhv.xv.51ff., 167ff).  When Dutthagāmani had won his victory over the Damilas and had brought peace to the country, he saw the prophecy inscribed on the stone pillar, but was unwilling to start the work as the people were too crippled with regard to money to be able to support such an immense undertaking.  But the devas read his thoughts and provided him with all the necessaries for the building of the Thūpa.  Prepared bricks were found on the banks of the Gambhīranadī, copper near Tambapittha, silver in the Ambatthakolalena, pearls at Uruvelā, and gems in a cave near Pelivāpigāma.  The building was started on the full moon day of Visākha.  The foundation stone was laid on the fourteenth day of the bright half of the month of Asālha.  Great celebrations marked the event, arrangements for which were in the hands of the ministers Visākha and Sirideva.  Monks were present not only from all over Ceylon but from many other places: eighty thousand under Indagutta from Rājagaha, twelve thousand under Dhammasena from Isipatana, sixty thousand under Piyadassī from Jetavanārāma, eighteen thousand under Mahā Buddharakkhita from Mahāvana in Vesāli, thirty thousand under Mahā Dhammarakkhita from Ghositārāma in Kosambī, forty thousand under Mahā Sangharakkhita from Dakkhināgiri in Ujjeni, one hundred and sixty thousand under Mittinna Asokārāma in Pātaliputta, two hundred and eighty thousand under Uttinna from Kasmīra, four hundred and sixty thousand under Mahādeva from Pallabhogga, thirty thousand under Yonamahā Dhammarakkhita from Alasandā, sixty thousand under Uttara from Viñjhātavī, thirty thousand under Cittagutta from Bodhimanda vihāra, eighty thousand under Candagutta from Vanavāsa, and ninety six thousand under Suriyagutta from Kelāsa vihāra.  Of arahants alone ninety six crores were present.[/p][p]As the king stepped into the space left open for him, he expressed the desire that, if his worship were to have a happy result, theras bearing the names of the Buddha, his Dhamma and his Sangha, should take their places on the east, south, and west sides respectively, and a thera bearing the name of Ananda on the north side, each thera to be surrounded by a group bearing the same name.  The king's wish was fulfilled; the theras in question and their companions were called Mahā Buddharakkhita, Mahā Dhammarakkhita, Mahā Sangharakkhita and Mahānanda.  As the king was about to mark the space to be covered by the cetiya, the Thera Siddhattha, looking into the future, told him to define only a moderate space for the Thūpa.  This the king did; then, looking at the theras immediately around him, he inquired their names and rejoiced to find them so auspicious, they being Siddhattha, Mangala, Sumam, Paduma, Sīvalī, Candagutta, Suriyagutta, Indagutta, Sāgara, Mittasena, Jayasena, and Acala.  He then laid the first foundation stone on the east side on sweet smelling clay prepared by Mittasena and sprinkled with water by Jayasena; Mahāsumana placed jasmine flowers on the stone.  Immediately the earth trembled in wonder.  The minister who helped the king to mark out the area of the cetiya was Suppatitthitabrahmā, son of Nandisena and Sumanadevī.  At the end of the ceremony, Piyadassī preached to the assembled populace, and many attained to various fruits of the Path.[/p][p]The Thūpa was like a water bubble in shape; its architect was Sirivaddha and his assistant Acala.  Orders were given that no unpaid work should be done in the construction of the cetiya.  Arahants caused the three terraces of flower offerings to the Thūpa (pupphādhānā) to sink nine times into the earth, in order, as they explained, to strengthen the foundations.  The cetiya was one hundred and twenty cubits high, and for the ten flower terraces alone ten crores of bricks were used.[/p][p]The Relic Chamber was of unparalleled magnificence, and consisted of four medavannapāsānā, each eighty cubits in length and in breadth and eight inches thick.  These were brought from Uttarakura by two sāmaneras, Uttara and Sumana.  In the Chamber were placed sculptural representations of the chief events connected with the Buddha's life as well as pictures of several Jātakas, including the Vessantara.  [/p][p]For list see Mhv.xxx.71ff.; the MT (549ff.) contains a long disquisition to prove that there is no reason to doubt the account given of the contents of the Relic Chamber, for in its construction the power (iddhi) of the king, of devas, and of arahants came into play.[/p][p]The work of the Relic Chamber was under the personal supervision of Indagutta Thera, of great iddhi power.  When the Chamber was ready for the enshrining of the Relics, Sonuttara of Pūjā parivena was entrusted with the task of obtaining them.  In a previous birth, as Nanduttara, he had vowed to have the power of doing this, and now was his opportunity.  He went to Mañjerika Nāga bhavana, where the Relics, washed away from the Thūpa at Rāmagāma, were in the custody of the Nāga Mahākāla, and by a display of iddhi power obtained them from the Nāga against his desire.  They represented one dona of the Buddha's Relics, and the Buddha had predicted that they would ultimately be placed in the Mahā Thūpa.  These Relics were enshrined on the fifteenth uposatha day in the light half of the month of Āsālha, under the constellation of Uttarāsālha.  Many devas and brahmas and nāgas were present as on the day of the Buddha's Enlightenment, and ninety six crores of arahants attended the ceremony.  As the king, after passing three times round the cetiya, ascended it on the east side, and was about to descend into the Relic Chamber, bearing on his head the Casket of Relics, the casket opened and the Relics rose out of it, and taking on the form of the Buddha, performed the Twin Miracle, as at the foot of the Gandamba.  When the Relics were placed on the couch prepared for them they assumed, as the king had desired, the form of the Buddha as he lay on his death bed.  For a whole week the celebrations lasted, and during this period the king offered to the Relics the dominion of Ceylon, and Indagutta decreed that the people of Ceylon, wherever they might be, should be able immediately to visit the Thūpa should they desire to do so.  At the end of the seven days, the two sāmaneras, Uttara and Sumana, closed the Chamber with the medavannapāsānā set apart for the purpose, while arahants pronounced that flowers offered in the Relic Chamber should not wither, nor scents dry up; the lamps should not be extinguished nor anything whatever perish.  [/p][p]The building of the Māha Thūpa is described in Mhv.  chaps xxviii-xxx.; MT. 514 83; Dpv.xix.1ff.; also Thūpavamsa (pp.  66ff.).[/p][p]The treasures enshrined in the Mahā Thūpa were worth twenty crores, the rest cost one thousand crores (Mhv.xxxii.18).[/p][p]Before the parasol of the Mahā Thūpa and the plaster work could be completed, Dutthagāmani fell ill, and his brother, Saddhātissa, summoned from Dīghavāpi, contrived with great skill to make the Thūpa look complete, that the king might see it before he died.  After the king's obsequies had been performed, in a place within sight of the Mahā Thūpa (Mhv.xxxii.58), Saddhātissa finished the work yet remaining and established celebrations to be performed three times daily at the Mahā Thūpa (Mhv.xxxii.60; Mhv.xxxiii.5).  Lañjatissa levelled the ground between the Mahā Thūpa and the Thūpārāma and built three stone terraces at the cost of three hundred thousand (Mhv.xxxiii.22f).  Khallātanāga made the courtyard of sand, surrounded by a wall (Mhv.xxxiii.31).  Bhātika constructed two vedikā round the courtyard (Mhv.xxxiv.39).  It is said (MT. 553f) that Bhātika was taken by the arahants into the Relic Chamber, and he held great celebrations in its honour (see Bhātikābhaya).  Mahādāthika Mahānāga converted the sand courtyard into a wide court laid out with kiñcakkha stones on plaster (Mhv.xxxiv.69), while Amandagāmani erected a parasol over the cetiya (Mhv.xxxv.2) and Ilanāga made the Lambakannas construct a roadway leading up to the Mahā, Thūpa (Mhv.xxxiv.17).  Sirināga had the whole Thūpa gilded and crowned with a new parasol (Mhv.xxxvi.24), this work being undertaken again later by Sanghatissa (Mhv.xxxvi.65), while Sanghabodhi made rain to pour down by means of prostrating himself in the courtyard (Mhv.xxxvi.75).  Jetthatissa offered two precious gems to the Thūpa (Mhv.xxxvi.126), while Aggabodhi I.  placed on the Thūpa a golden umbrella (Cv.xlii.32), From this time onward the country passed through very troublous times and the Mahā Thūpa was neglected.  But it was restored by Parakkamabāhu I.  (Cv.lxxiv.10; lxxvi.106f; lxxviii.97) and again by Kittinissanka (Cv.lxxx.20); it was later pillaged by Māgha (Cv.lxxx.68), and remained neglected till the time of Parakkamabāhu II., who started the work of reconstruction (Cv.lxxxvii.66), which was completed by his son Vijayabāhu IV.  Cv.lxxxviii.83; after this, the cetiya once more fell into disrepair and has so continued till recently, when an attempt is being made to rebuild it.[/p][p]The Mahā Thūpa has been a place of pilgrimage for Buddhists from the time of its building down to the present day, even when the place was deserted and its courtyards overgrown with creepers (e.g., Vibhā.446).  There seems to have been a hall for pilgrims to the west of the cetiya (Vibhā.446).  When the Buddha's sāsana disappears, all the Relics of the Buddha deposited in various cetiyas all over Ceylon will gather together at the Mahācetiya, and from there will go to the Rajāyatana cetiya in Nāgadīpa, thence to the, Mahābodhipallanka, where all the Relics, assembled from everywhere, will take the form of the Buddha seated at the foot of the Bodhi tree.  Then they will be consumed by self generated flames (Vibhā.433).[/p][p]The Mahā Thūpa is known by other names: Mahācetiya, Ratanavāluka (Cv.lxxvi.106), Ratanavāli (Cv.lxxx.68), Sonnamāli (Mhv.xxvii.3) (Hemamāli), and Hemavāluka (Cv.li.82).[/p]</entry>
  <entry>[div class="huge"]Mahaka Sutta[/div][p]Once a number of monks staying in the Ambātakagrove in Macchikāsanda were entertained by Citta-gahapati to a sumptuous meal.  At the end of the meal, Citta, escorted them back to the monastery.  On the way the monks were overcome by the heat, and Mahaka, the junior monk, with the permission of his senior, made by his magic power a cool wind to blow and wrought a thunderstorm accompanied by gentle rain.  Citta was greatly impressed, and, seeking Mahaka in his cell, asked him to perform some miracle.  Mahaka told him to put his cloak on the veranda and to scatter a bundle of grass on it.  Then he retired to his cell, locked the door, and caused a flame to dart through the keyhole and burn the grass without damaging the cloak.  Citta was overcome with surprise, and promised to supply Mahaka with all requisites.  Mahaka thanked him, but soon after left Macchikāsanda never to return.

In the  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/l/lakkhana_s,Lakkhana Sutta')"]Lakkhana Sutta[/a] (D.iii.142ff) they sought to explain how these marks arose, and maintained that they were due entirely to good deeds done in a former birth and could only be continued in the present life by means of goodness.  Thus the marks are merely incidental; most of them are so absurd, considered as the marks of a human being, that they are probably mythological in origin, and a few of them seem to belong to solar myths, being adaptations to a man, of poetical epithets applied to the sun or even to the personification of human sacrifice.  Some are characteristic of human beauty, and one or two may possibly be reminiscences of personal bodily peculiarities possessed by some great man, such as Gotama himself.[/p][p]Apart from these legendary beliefs, the Buddha had his own theory of the attributes of a Mahāpurisa as explained in the Mahāpurisa Sutta (S.v.158) and the Vassakāra Sutta (A.ii.35f).[/p][p]Buddhaghosa says (MA.ii.761) that when the time comes for the birth of a Buddha, the Suddhāvāsa Brahmās visit the earth in the guise of brahmins and teach men about these bodily signs as forming part of the Vedic teaching so that thereby auspicious men may recognize the Buddha.  On his death this knowledge generally vanishes.  He defines a Mahāpurisa as one who is great owing to his panidhi, samādāna, ñāna and karunā.  A Mahāpurisa can be happy in all conditions of climate.

It is said that he had fifty five elder and younger brothers who all joined the Order at Cetiyagiri at the end of a sermon by Mahinda on the Vassūpanāyikakhandha (Mhv.xvi.10).  This was before the commencement of the rainy season, but elsewhere (Mhv.xviii.3; perhaps here we have to deal with two different traditions) it is said that Arittha was sent in the month of Assayuja - after the pavārana, when the rains were over - to Pātaliputta to fetch Sanghamittā and the Bodhi tree from the court of Asoka, and that, he agreed to go only on condition that he should join the Order on his return.  The king consented, and, his mission successfully concluded, he entered the Order with five hundred others and attained arahantship (Mhv.xix.5, 12, 66).  He died in the reign of Uttiya (Mhv.xx.54).  [/p][p]The Samantapāsādikā (Sp.i.102ff) gives an account of a recital (sangīti) held in Ceylon by Mahā Arittha.

A seat, facing south, was provided for Mahinda, Arittha's seat, the dhammāsana, facing north.  Arittha occupied this seat at Mahinda's request, and sixty eight Mahā-theras, led by Mahinda, sat around him.  Devānampiyatissa's younger brother, Mattābhaya Thera, with five hundred others, were present in order to learn the Vinaya, the king also being present.  When Arittha began his recital of the Vinaya, many miracles occurred.

He lived in the charnel field meditating, and, one day, the crematrix Kālā, noticing him, arranged the limbs of a recently cremated body near the Thera that he might gaze at them.  With these as a topic of meditation, he soon became an arahant.[/p][p]Thag.vss.151f.; his story is given in much greater detail at DhA.i.66ff.; there he is said to have been the eldest of three brothers, of whom the others were Majjhimakāla and Cūlakāla.  He went with the latter to Sāvatthi, where both of them joined the Order.  After becoming an arahant, Mahākāla went with the Buddha to Setavyā and dwelt in the Simsapā grove, Cūlakāla accompanying him.  Cūlakāla's wives invited the Buddha and the other monks to a meal, and he himself went on earlier to make arrangements.  His wives disrobed him.  At the end of the meal, Mahākāla was left behind by the Buddha to make the thanksgiving.  His eight wives surrounded him and stripped him of his robes, but, knowing their intention, he disappeared through the air.[/p][p]Ninety one kappas ago, while wandering near the mountain Urugana, he saw the rag robe of an ascetic and offered three kinkinika flowers in its honour (ThagA.i.271f).

He, being taken for a thief, was beaten to death.  When this was reported to the Buddha, he related a story of the past in which Mahākāla had been a forest guard of the king of Benares.  One day he saw a man entering the forest road with his beautiful wife and, falling in love with the wife, invited them to his house.  He then had a gem placed in the man's cart, and the latter was beaten to death as a thief.  DhA.iii.149ff.[/p][hr][h4]3. Mahākāla[/h4][p]A Naga king who dwelt in the Mañjerika Nāgabhavana.

To the Nāga because of his long life it seemed that the previous Buddha had died only the preceding day, and he rejoiced to think that another had been born.  He went therefore to the scene of the Buddha's Enlightenment with his Nāga maidens and they sang the Buddha's praises.

Visākhā once left it behind in the monastery, where she had gone to hear the Buddha preach, and when she sent her slave girl for it Ananda had already put it away.  She, thereupon, refused to take it back and had it sold.  It was worth nine crores, the workmanship being worth one hundred thousand.  No one was found able to buy it, so Visākhā herself paid the price for it, and, with the proceeds, erected the Migāramātupāsāda (DhA.i.411ff).  Mallikā, after the death of her husband, refused to wear her jewels, and, when the Buddha's body was being taken for cremation, she washed her ornament in scented water and placed it on the Buddha's bier with the following resolve: " May I, in future births, have a body that shall need no ornaments, but which shall appear as though it always bore them (DA.ii.597).[/p][p]The making of Visākhā's ornament took four months, with five hundred goldsmiths working day and night.  In its construction were used four pint pots (nāli) of diamonds, eleven of pearls, twenty two of coral, thirty three of rubies, one thousand nikkhas of ruddy gold, and sufficient silver.  The thread work was entirely of silver, the parure was fastened to the head and extended to the feet.  In various places, seals of gold and dies of silver were attached to hold it in position.  In the fabric itself was a peacock with five hundred feathers of gold in either wing, a coral beak, jewels for the eyes, the neck feathers and the tail.

When Paduma's mother died, his father took another wife.  On one occasion the king had to leave the city to quell a border rising, and, thinking the dangers too great to take his queen with him, he entrusted her to the care of Paduma.  The campaign was victorious.  In the course of making arrangements for the celebration of his father's return, Paduma entered the queen's apartments.  She was struck by his amazing beauty, and fell in love with him, inviting him to lie with her.  On his indignant refusal, she feigned illness, and, on the return of the king, falsely accused him of having ill treated her.  The king gave orders, in spite of the protestations of the people, that Paduma should be thrown from the "Robbers' Cliff." The deity of the mountain saved his life and entrusted him to the care of the Nāga king, who took him to his abode, where he stayed for one year.  Paduma then went to the Himālaya and became an ascetic.  The king heard of this and went to offer him the kingdom, but it was refused by Paduma.  The king, convinced of the falsity of the charge brought against Paduma, caused the queen to be flung from the Robbers' Cliff.[/p][p]The story was related in reference to Ciñcamānavikā's false accusations against the Buddha.

  <entry>[div class="huge"]Mahāgovinda Sutta[/div][p]Pañcasikha visits the Buddha at Gijjhakūta and tells him of a meeting once held in Tāvatimsa.  At this meeting Sakka rejoices with the devas of Tāvatimsa over the increase in their numbers owing to the appearance in their midst of new devas produced by the good kamma of the followers of the new view of life put forward by the Buddha.  Sakka expresses his joy in a song and then utters an eulogy on the eight qualities of the Buddha.  Brahmā Sanankumāra appears and desires to hear the eulogy, which is, accordingly, repeated for his benefit.  Sanankumāra says that the Buddha has ever been thus wise, and tells the story of Disampati and his son Renu.  Disampati has a purohita called Govinda and when he dies Disampati is distressed, but, at the suggestion of Renu, appoints Govinda's son Jotipāla in his place.[/p][p]On the death of Disampati Renu becomes king, and, with Jotipāla's help, divides his kingdom into seven to be shared by himself and six of his friends, the divisions of the kingdom being Dantapura, Potana, Māhissati, Roruka, Mithilā, Campā and Bārānasi; and the kings, respectively, are: Sattabhū, Brahmadatta, Vessabhū, Bharata, Renu and two Dhataratthas.  Jotipāla, now called Mahāgovinda by virtue of his post, trains seven others to fill the posts of stewards to the seven kings.  Mahāgovinda acquires the reputation of having seen Brahmā face to face, and, in order to justify this reputation, he takes leave of Renu and practises meditation for four months.  During his meditation, Sanankumāra appears before him and tells him that he may see Brahmā face to face and attain communion with him.  Here we have the teaching regarding the ideal brahmin.  Mahāgovinda decides to leave the world and carry out the teachings of Sanankumāra.  Having obtained the leave of his master, he enters the homeless life, where he practises the four ecstasies of love, pity, sympathy in joy and equanimity.  He teaches these to his disciples, and, after death, they are all born into the Brahma world.[/p][p]At the end of Pañcasikha's recital, the Buddha tells him that he himself was Mahāgovinda and therefore remembers all that life.

  <entry>[div class="huge"]Mahāsuññatā Sutta[/div][p]Preached at Nigrodhārāma in Kapilavatthu.  The Buddha was staying in the cell erected by Kālakhemaka, and near by, in the cell erected by Ghatāya, Ananda, with many monks, was making robes.  The Buddha knew from the number of pallets outside the cells of Kālakhemaka that many monks were in residence there.  He therefore addressed Ananda, telling him of the joys of tranquility and solitude.  A monk should dwell apart and concentrate his heart internally and thus develop the four jhānas.  He then knows that, whatever his posture, he will be free from evil dispositions; his speech will be free from faults, his thoughts pure.  A monk should always search his heart to discover if he has any traffic with pleasures of sense.  A disciple should follow his master's footsteps, not in order to obtain interpretations of canonical law, but solely to hear words which conduce to passionless ness, illumination, Nibbāna (M.iii.109 18).[/p][p]The sutta is also called Ganabheda, because it tends to break up crowds.

Rāhula stops and sits under a tree meditating.  Sāriputta approaches and suggests that he should develop ānāpānasati.  Later in the evening Rāhula asks the Buddha how he can do this.  The Buddha describes how it is done by regarding all the elements earth, water, fire, air and space, both personal and external with disgust and loathing of heart.  One should not allow sensory impressions to lay hold of one's heart, just as the earth remains impassive whatever may be thrown upon it.  It is so with the other elements.  One should grow in loving-kindness, compassion, in gladness over the welfare of others, in equanimity, contemplation of the body's corruption, perception of the fleeting nature of things, and in the mindfulness which comes from ordered breathing.[/p][p]M.i.420 6; it is perhaps a part of this sutta which is quoted at Mil.  385, 388; see Mil.

D.iii.92f.; Mtu.i.248; DhSA.  390, 392) to show indignation against and disapproval of those worthy of blame.  In return for his services, he was given a portion of their harvest.

At his cry of alarm the flock fled, with the exception of Sumukha, who stayed and asked Khemaka for permission to take Dhatarattha's place.  When Sumukha heard why they had been caught, he asked that both he and Dhatarattha should be taken before Samyama.  When Samyama heard of Sumukha's devotion he was greatly touched, and showed the hamsas every possible honour, after asking their forgiveness for the way they had been treated.  Dhatarattha preached to the queen and the royal household, and, having exhorted the king to rule righteously, returned to Cittakūta.[/p][p]The story was told in reference to Ananda's attempt to sacrifice his own life for that of the Buddha, when Nālāgiri (q.v.) was sent to kill him.[/p][p]Khemaka was Channa, Khemā the Therī Khemā, the king Sāriputta, Sumukha Ananda, and Dhatarattha the Bodhisatta.

  <entry>[div class="huge"]Mahā Ummagga Jātaka (No.  546)[/div][p]The Bodhisatta was once born in Mithilā as the son of Sirivaddhaka and Sumanādevi.  The child was born with a medicinal plant in his hand, and was therefore called Mahosadha.  He talked immediately after birth, and it is said that, on the day of his conception, Videha, king of Mithilā, dreamed a dream, which presaged the birth of a sage.  From early childhood Mahosadha gave evidence of unusual ability, and one of his first acts was to build a large hall and lay out a garden with the help of his companions.  The king wished to have him in the court though he was only seven years old, but was dissuaded by his wise men.  But he sent a councillor to watch the boy and report of his doings from time to time.  When the king was fully convinced (the Jātaka gives an account of nineteen problems solved by Mahosadha) that Mahosadha was undoubtedly endowed with unusual wisdom, he sent for him in spite of the counsel of his ministers - Senaka, Pukkusa, Kāvīnda and Devinda- and appointed him as his fifth councillor.  One day, Mahosadha saved the queen Udumbarā (q.v.) from the unjust wrath of the king, and ever after she was his firm and loyal friend.  After his entry into the court, Mahosadha was on many occasions called upon to match his wit against that of the senior councillors, and on each occasion he emerged triumphant.  E.g., in the Mendakapañha (q.v.) and the Sirimandapañha (q.v.).  [/p][p]When aged sixteen he married Amarādevī.  She was a wise woman, and frustrated many attempts of Mahosadha's enemies to embroil him with the king.  Once they stole various things from the palace and sent them to her.  She accepted them, and made assignations with each of the donors.  When they arrived she had them seized, their heads shaved, and themselves thrown into the jakes, where she tormented them, and then arraigned them before the king with the stolen goods.  Mahosadha, aware of the plots against him, lay in hiding, and the deity of the king's parasol put several questions to the king, knowing that none but Mahosadha could answer them.  The king sent men to seek him, and he was discovered working for a potter.  The king showed him all honour, and obtained from him the answers to the deity's questions.[/p][p]But his enemies continued to plot against him, until orders were given by the king that he should be killed the next day.  Udumbarā, discovered this and warned him.  But in the meantime he had discovered the guilty secrets of his enemies: Senaka had killed a courtesan, Pukkusa had a leprous spot on his thigh, Kāvinda was possessed by a yakkha named Naradeva, and Devinda had stolen the king's most precious gem.  Mahosadha posted these facts everywhere in the city, and the next day went boldly into the palace.  The king professed innocence of any evil intentions against him; but Mahosadha exposed the schemes of them all, and Senaka and the others were only saved from severe punishment by the intervention of Mahosadha himself.  Thenceforward Mahosadha was Videha's trusted councillor, and took various measures to increase his royal master's power and glory.  Spies were sent to every court, whence they brought home reports.  Mahosadha also had a parrot whom he employed to ferret out the most baffling secrets.  While returning from a visit to Sankhapala, king of Ekabala, the parrot passed through Uttarapañcāla and there overheard a conversation between Cūlani Brahmadatta, king of Kampilla, and his purohita Kevatta, wherein the latter unfolded a scheme for capturing the whole of Jambudīpa.  Kevatta was too wise to allow Brahmadatta, to attack Mithilā, knowing of Mahosadha's power, but Mahosadha deliberately provoked Brahmadatta by sending his men to upset a feast he had prepared, during which he had planned to poison the hundred princes whom he had brought under subjection.  Brahmadatta then set out to attack Mithilā.  He laid siege to the city, and adopted various ways of compelling the citizens to surrender.  But Mahosadha was more than a match for him, and found means of defeating all his plans.  In the end Mahosadha engaged the services of Anukevatta, who, pretending to be a traitor to Mithilā, went over to the army of Brahmadatta and, gaining the king's confidence, informed him that Kevatta and all the other counsellors of Brahmadatta had accepted bribes from Mahosadha.  The king listened to him, and on his advice raised the siege and fled to his own city.[/p][p]But Kevatta planned revenge, and, a year later, he persuaded Brahmadatta to send poets to Videha's city, singing songs of the peerless beauty of the daughter of Brahmadatta, Pañcālacandī.  Videha heard the songs and sent a proposal of marriage, and Kevatta came to Mithilā to arrange the day.  Videha suggested that Kevatta should meet Mahosadha to discuss the plans, but Mahosadha feigned illness, and when Kevatta arrived at his house, he was grossly insulted by Mahosadha's men.  When Kevatta had left, Videha consulted Mahosadha, but would not be dissuaded from his plan to marry Pañcālacandī.  Finding that he could do nothing with the king, Mahosadha sent his parrot Matthara to find out what he could from the maynah bird which lived in Brahmadatta's bedchamber.  Matthara used all his wits and won the favour of the maynah and learnt from her of Kevatta's plan, which he repeated to Mahosadha.[/p][p]With Videha's leave, Mahosadha went on Uttarapañcāla to, as he said, make preparations for the wedding.  But he gave orders for a village to be built on every league of ground along the road, and gave instructions to the shipwright, Anandakumāra, to build and hold ready three hundred ships.  At Uttarapañcāla he was received with great honour, and obtained the king's permission to build in the city a palace for Videha.  The king gave him a free hand, and be immediately started to threaten to pull down houses belonging to various people, from the queen mother downwards, and obtained money from them as bribes to spare their houses.  Having reported to the king that no suitable spot was available within the city, he obtained his consent to erect a palace outside the city, between that and the Ganges.  All access was forbidden to the site on penalty of a large sum, and having first erected a village called Gaggali for his workmen, elephants, etc., Mahosadha started to dig a tunnel, the mouth of which was in the Ganges.  The tunnel, a marvellous place, was duly constructed, fitted with all manner of machinery, and beautifully decorated.  A smaller tunnel was dug, leading into the larger, one opening, which was, however, concealed, giving access to the king's palace.  The task occupied four months, and when all preparations were complete, Mahosadha sent word to Videha.[/p][p]Videha arrived at Brahmadatta's court, and a great feast was held in his honour at Upakārī, the palace which had been prepared for his residence.  While the feast was in progress, Mahosadha sent men by the smaller tunnel to the palace and bade them fetch Talatā (the queen mother), the queen Nandā, and Pañcālacandī, on the pretext that they had been sent for by Brahmadatta to take part in the festivities as Videha and Mahosadha had both been killed, according to plan.  Meanwhile Brahmadatta had given orders that the whole city should be surrounded.  Videha was overcome with fright on discovering what was happening, but he put himself into Mahosadha's hands.  The latter led him into the large tunnel, and there he was brought face to face with the members of Brahmadatta's family, who had already been conducted thither.  Pañcālacandī was placed upon a heap of treasure and married to Videha.  On emerging from the tunnel, they were placed on board a waiting ship, with Tālatā and Nandā, and sent away into safety, escorted by the other ships, Mahosadha himself remaining behind in Uttarapañcāla.[/p][p]The next day, Brahmadatta came with his army to Upakāri, hoping to capture Videha.  There Mahosadha revealed to him what had happened, and, in due course, persuaded him to forget his wrath and inspect the tunnel.  While in the tunnel Brahmadatta expressed his remorse for having listened to the evil advice of Brahmadatta, and he and Mahosadha swore eternal friendship.  Mahosadha returned to Mithilā, taking with him Brahmadatta's dowry for his daughter; the members of Brahmadatta's family returned to Uttarapañcāla, and the two kings lived in great amity.[/p][p]Videha died ten years later, and in fulfilment of a promise made to Brahmadatta, Mahosadha went to Uttarapañcāla.  There Nandā, who had never forgiven him, tried to poison the king's mind against him; but this plot was frustrated by a religious woman, Bherī (q.v.), and Brahmadatta remained his firm friend, loving him, as he confessed to Bheri, more than any of his own family.[/p][p]The Jātaka was related to illustrate the Buddha's great wisdom.

Then their wives came and bathed her in the  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/anotatta,Anotatta Lake')"]Anotatta Lake[/a] and clad her in divine robes.  They then led her into a golden palace and laid her on a divine couch; there the Bodhisatta, in the form of a white elephant, holding a white lotus in his gleaming trunk, entered into her right side.  This was on the day of the Uttarāsālhanakkhatta, after a festival lasting seven days, in which she had already taken part.[/p][p]From the day of her conception she was guarded by the Four Regent Gods; she felt no desire for men, and the child in her womb could be seen from outside.

  <entry>[div class="huge"]Mahākanha Jātaka (No.  469)[/div][p]In the past, when the teachings of Kassapa Buddha were already forgotten, there ruled a king named Usīnara.  Monks and nuns lived in wickedness, and men followed evil paths, being born, after death, in the Niraya.  Sakka, finding no one entering the deva worlds from among men, decided to scare the men into virtue.  Assuming the guise of a forester and leading Mātali disguised as a black fierce looking dog called Mahākanha, Sakka came to the city gates and cried aloud that the world was doomed to destruction.  The people fled in terror into the city and the gates were shut.  But the forester leapt over the city wall with his dog, the latter scaring everyone he saw.  The king shut himself up in his palace, but the dog put his forefeet on the palace window and set up a roar, which was heard from the hells to the highest heavens.  The forester said the dog was hungry, and the king ordered food to be given him.  But he ate it all in one mouthful and roared for more.  Usīnara then asked the forester what kind of dog it was, and was told that the animal ate up all those who walked in unrighteousness, and described who the unrighteous were.  Then having terrified everyone, Sakka revealed himself and returned to his heaven.  The king and his people became virtuous, and Kassapa's religion lasted for one thousand years more.[/p][p]The story was told in reference to a conversation among the monks to the effect that the Buddha was always working for the good of others, never resting, never tiring, his compassion extended towards all beings.

  <entry>[div class="huge"]Mahāhatthipadopama Sutta[/div][p]Sāriputta addresses the monks at Jetavana and tells them that, just as the foot of every creature will fit in the elephant's footprint, even so are all right states of mind comprised within the Four Noble Truths.  He then goes on to explain that dukkha consists of the five upādānakkhandhas visible shapes, feelings, perception, sankhāras and consciousness.  The constituents of these attachments are the four principle elements: earth, water, fire, and air.  Each element is of two kinds personal (ajjhatta) and external (bahiddhā) - and each is transient and subject to decay.  The chain of causation entails all that makes up the five attachments.  Where there is eye intact, on which external shapes come to focus, and where there is developed pertinent material to sustain it, there is developed a manifestation of the pertinent section of consciousness.  Thus arises the upādānakkhandha of form; similarly with the others.  M.i.184 91.[/p]</entry>
  <entry>[div class="huge"]Mahāmeghavana[/div][p][b]1. Mahāmeghavana[/b][/p][p]A park to the south of Anurādhapura.  Between the park and the city lay Nandana or Jotivana.  The park was laid out by Mutasīva, and was so called because at the time the spot was chosen for a garden, a great cloud, gathering at an unusual time, poured forth rain (Mhv.xi.2f).  Devānampiyatissa gave the park to Mahinda for the use of the Order (Mhv.xv.8, 24; Dpv.xviii.18; Sp.i.81) and within its boundaries there came into being later the Mahā-Vihāra and its surrounding buildings.  The fifteenth chapter of the Mahāvamsa (Mhv.xv.27ff) gives a list of the chief spots associated with the religion, which came into existence there.  Chief among these are the sites of the Bodhi tree, the thirty two mālakas, the Catussālā, the Mahā Thūpa, the Thūpārāma, the Lohapāsāda, and various parivenas connected with Mahinda: Sunhāta, Dīghacankamana, Phalagga, Therāpassaya, Marugana and Dīghasandasenāpati.  Later, the Abhayagīri vihāra and the Jetavanārāma were also erected there.  [/p][p]The Mahāmeghavana was visited by Gotama Buddha (Mhv.i.80; Dpv.ii.61, 64), and also by the three Buddhas previous to him.  In the time of Kakusandha it was known as Mahātittha, in that of Konagamana as Mahānoma, and in that of Kassapa as Mahāsāgara (Mhv.xv.58, 92, 126).  [/p][p]The Mahāmeghavana was also called the Tissārāma, and on the day it was gifted to the Sangha, Mahinda scattered flowers on eight spots contained in it, destined for future buildings, and the earth quaked eight times (Mhv.xv.174).  This was on the day of Mahinda's arrival in Anurādhapura.  The first building to be erected in the Mahāmeghavana was the Kālapāsāda parivena (q.v.) for the use of Mahinda.  In order to hurry on the work, bricks used in the building were dried with torches (Mhv.xv.203).  The boundary of the Mahāmeghavana probably coincided with the sīmā of the Mahāvihāra, but it was later altered by Kanitthatissa, when he built the Dakkhina vihāra.  Mhv.xxxvi.12.

  <entry>[div class="huge"]Mahāsāra Jātaka (No.  92)[/div][p]The Bodhisatta was once minister of Brahmadatta, king of Benares.  One day the king went with his queens to the park and the latter took off their ornaments for bathing.  A female monkey, watching her opportunity, stole a pearl necklace.  On the loss being discovered, the king had every person and every place searched.  A rustic, seeing the commotion, took to his heels and was chased and captured by the guards.  When questioned, he confessed to having stolen the necklace, thinking that the best way of saving his life, and said he had given it to the Treasurer.  The Treasurer said he had given it to the chaplain, the chaplain to the chief musician, the musician to the courtesan.  As it was by this time late, the matter was put off till the next day, the alleged accomplices being imprisoned.  The Bodhisatta, doubting their words, obtained the king's leave to investigate the matter.  He had the prisoners watched, and knew, from their reported conversations, that they were innocent.  He then decided that it had been stolen by a monkey, and gave orders that a number of monkeys should be captured and turned loose again with strings of beads round their necks, wrists, and ankles.  The monkey, who had stolen the necklace, on seeing the others with their beads, was filled with jealousy and produced the necklace.  The guard frightened her, and so she dropped it, and the Bodhisatta was greatly praised for his wisdom.[/p][p]The story was told in reference to Ananda.  Pasenadi's wives wished for someone to preach to them in the palace.  Pasenadi went to the Buddha and from him heard the praises of Chattapānī.  Later, he met him and asked him to preach in his harem.  But Chattapānī was unwilling, saying that it was the prerogative of the monks.  Thereupon the king asked the Buddha to appoint someone, and the Buddha appointed Ananda.  One day Ananda found all the women of the palace very dejected, and learnt that the jewel of the king's turban had been lost and everyone was most distracted.  Ananda, therefore, went to the king and asked that each suspect should be given a wisp of straw on a lump of clay and asked to place it somewhere, the idea being that the thief would leave the jewel in one of these lumps.  The ruse, however, did not succeed, and orders were then given that a water pot be set in a retired corner of the courtyard behind a screen and that everyone should be asked to wash his hands.  When all had washed, the pot was emptied and the jewel found inside it.[/p][p]Ananda is identified with the king of the Jātaka.  J.i.381 7.[/p]</entry>

  <entry>[div class="huge"]Mahā Kammavibhanga Sutta[/div][p]Potaliputta comes to Samiddhi in his forest hut, near Veluvana in Rājagaha, and tells him that the Buddha has declared that all one says or does is vain; the only thing of importance is that which passes in one's mind.  Samiddhi protests against this, and when Potaliputta says, "Tell me, what does a man experience who acts of set purpose?" gives his own explanation.  Potaliputta then goes away without further talk and seeks Ananda, to whom he reports the incident.  Ananda takes him to the Buddha, remarking that Samiddhi should not have given a single direct reply to a question, which required careful qualifications in the answer.  Lāludāyi interrupts and is rebuked by the Buddha, who explains that the question was essentially a triple one and should have been so answered.  If a man's purposeful act is calculated to produce a pleasant feeling, his experience is pleasant; if an unpleasant feeling, unpleasant; if neither pleasant nor unpleasant, it is neither.  Ananda asks him to explain further, and this he does.  A man may be wicked in this world and yet, at death, pass either into heaven or into hell, he may be good yet go into hell or into heaven.  But one should not rush to conclusions from this truth, because the consequence of man's action, good or bad, may be felt either here and now, in the next birth, or at some other time.

Mahātissa told Cittagutta that the description was not full enough.  MT.  552f.[hr][b]11. Mahātissa Thera.[/b] Incumbent of Kambugallaka Vihāra.  He was a colleague of Kupikkala Mahātissa, and interceded on behalf of Vattagāmanī when that king's ministers wished to leave him.  Later, the ministers appointed him to look after all the monasteries built by them.  Mhv.xxxiii.76, 89ff.; MT.  619, 622.[hr][b]12. Mahātissa Thera.[/b] Incumbent of Kupikkala Vihāra.  When Vattagāmanī was in hiding in the forest of Vessagiri, the Elder once provided him with a meal, and the king, out of gratitude, made him a grant of land (Mhv.xxxiii.49).  Later, the ministers wanted to revolt against the king on account of his cruelty to Tanasīva, but the Elder and his colleague Mahātissa from Kambugallaka, prevented them from doing so (Mhv.xxxiii.76).  When Vattagāmanī built the Abhayagiri Vihāra, he gave it into the charge of Mahātissa.  Mhv.xxxiii.83.[hr][b]13. Mahātissa Thera.[/b] An incumbent of the Mahāvihāra.  He was expelled by reason of his association with families.  His pupil Bahalamassutissa thereupon seceded from the Mahāvihāra and established a new sect in Abhayagiri.  Mhv.xxxiii.95ff.[hr][b]14. Mahātissa Thera.  [/b] Incumbent of Anurārāma.  Vohārīka Tissa was so pleased with him that he ordered alms to be regularly given to him in the Mucelapattana.  Mhv.xxxvi.30.[hr][b]15. Mahātissa Thera.  [/b] Even when sixty years old he did not realize that he was a puthujjana.  Then, one day, his pupil Dhammadinna of Talangara came to him, asking for his company in a journey to Tissamahā-vihāra, where he had been asked to preach.  Mahātissa greeted him, and in the course of conversation, Dhammadinna discovered that his teacher was under the false impression that he was an arahant.  Wishing to show him his error, he persuaded Mahātissa, by his iddhi power, to create a pond, and in the pond a lotus, which a young girl was picking.  At the sight of the girl, Mahātissa was possessed by lust, and realized that he was no arahant.  Dhammadinna withdrew, and that same day Mahātissa put forth effort and attained arahantship.  AA.i.25.[hr][b]16. Mahātissa.[/b] An incumbent of Cittalapabbata.  He was troubled by lustful thoughts and consulted his teacher.  The Thera asked him to prepare a cell for him, which he did with great care.  The Thera then asked him to occupy it for one night, since he had taken so much trouble over it.  That night Mahātissa put forth effort and became an arahant.  AA.i.26.</entry>

  <entry>[div class="huge"]Mahāvihāra[/div][p]The great monastery at Anurādhapura, for many centuries the chief seat of Buddhism in Ceylon.  It was founded by Devānampiyatissa, on the counsel of Mahinda, and included the Mahāmeghavana.  The Mahāmeghavanārāma henceforth came to be included in the Mahāvihāra.  The boundary of the vihāra was marked out by the king ploughing a circular furrow starting from near the Gangalatittha on the Kadambanadī and ending again at the river (Mhv.xv.188ff.; MT.361; Mbv.  135, 136 says that the ford on the Kadambanadī was Pāsānatittha).  [/p][p]A list is given in the Mahābodhivamsa (pp.  135f) of the places through which the simā (boundary) of the Mahāvihāra passed - Pāsānatittha, Kuddavātakapāsāna, Kumbhakāraāvāta, the Mahānīpa tree, Kakudhapāli, Mahāangana tree, Khujjamātula tree, Marutta pokkharanī, the northern gate of the Vijayārāma park, Gajakumbhakapāsāna, then passing Avattimajjha, Bālakapāsāna on the Abhayavāpi, Mahāsusāna, Dīghapāsāna, the left side of Candalagāma, the Nīcasusāna to the left of Kammāradeva Sīmānigrodha, Veluvangana, round the hermitages of the Niganthas Jotiya Giri and Kumbhanda, to the right of the various hermitages of the Paribbājakas, by Hiyagalla, along the shrine of the brahmin Dīyavāsa, through Telumapāli, Tālacatukka, to the right of the stables (assamandala), on to Sasakapāsāna and Marumbatittha.  It then proceeded up the river to Sīhasinānatittha, on to Pāsānatittha, ending at Kuddavātakapāsāna.[/p][p]The Mahāvihāra contained thirty two Mālakas (Mhv.xv.214) and had numerous buildings attached to it, apart from sacred shrines, such as the Mahābodhi tree, Thūpārāma, Mahā Thūpa, etc.  In its early period, the precincts of the Mahāvihāra contained other buildings besides those dedicated to the service of Buddhism e.g., the hermitages of the Niganthas and the Paribbājakas (as mentioned above) and the shrine of the guardian deity of Anurādhapura (Mhv.xxv.87).  In the time of Vattagāmanī, the Mahāvihāra monks divided into two factions, and one party occupied Abhayagiri, built by the king (Mhv.xxxiii.97f).  At first the differences between these two factions were trivial, but, as time went on, Abhayagiri grew in power and riches and proved a formidable rival to the older monastery.[/p][p]From time to time various kings and nobles made additions and restorations to the Mahāvihāra.  Thus Vasabha (Mhv.xxxxv.88) built a row of cells, and Bhātikatissa erected a boundary wall (Mhv.xxxvi.2), while Kanitthatissa removed the boundary wall and constructed the Kukkutagiri parivena, twelve large pāsādas, a refectory, and a road leading from Mahāvihāra to Dakkhinavihāra (Mhv.xxxvi.10f).  Vohārikatissa appointed a monthly gift of a thousand to the monks of Mahāvihāra (Mhv.xxxvi.32), while Sirisanghabodhi built a salāka house (Mhv.xxxvi.74).  Gothābhaya erected a stone pavilion and made a padhānabhūmi to the west of the vihāra (Mhv.xxxvi.102,106).[/p][p]Towards the latter part of Gothābhaya's reign, a dispute arose between the Mahāvihāra and Abhayagiri on matters of doctrine, and sixty monks of Abhayagiri, who had adopted the Vetulyavāda, were banished.  They obtained the assistance of a Cola monk, named Sanghatissa, and at a solemn assembly of the monks concerned, at Thūpārāma, Sanghamitta expounded his heretical doctrine, refuting the opposition of the Mahāvihāra monks, and succeeded in winning over the king, who was present, in spite of the efforts of his uncle, Gothābhaya Thera, to bring him round to the orthodox party.  Sanghamitta became tutor to the king's sons, and when one of these, Mahāsena, became king, he prompted him to destroy the Mahāvihāra.  A royal decree was issued forbidding the giving of alms to the Mahāvihāra.  The monks thereupon left the monastery, and for nine years it remained deserted.  Many of the buildings were destroyed, and various possessions belonging to the Mahāvihāra were removed to Abhayagiri; but the people, led by the king's minister and friend, Meghavannābhaya, revolted against the impious deeds of Mahāsena and his admirers, Sanghamitta and Sona, and the king was forced to yield.  Sanghamitta and Sona were slain by one of the queens, and the king, with the help of Meghavannābhaya, rebuilt several parivenas and restored some of the possessions, which had been removed.  But Mahāsena's allegiance to the Mahāvihāra teaching was not lasting; acting on the advice of a monk named Tissa, he built the Jetavanavihāra in the grounds of the Mahāvihāra, against the wish of the monks there; the latter left again for nine months as a sign of protest against the king's attempts to remove the boundary of the vihāra.  This attempt, however, he was forced to abandon (Mhv.xxxvi.110f.; xxxvii.1 37).[/p][p]Mahāsena's son, Sirimeghavanna, on coming to the throne, exerted himself to undo the damage which had been wrought by his father.  He rebuilt the Lohapāsāda and restored all the demolished parivenas, together with their endowments (Cv.xxxvii.54ff).  Mahāvihāra had, by now, become famous as a seat of learning; it was the centre of Theravāda Buddhism, and was the repository of various Commentaries, of which the chief were the Sīhalatthakathā on the Pāli Canon.  Thither, therefore, came scholars from various countries, among them Buddhaghosa (q.,v.), who resided in the Ganthākara parivena and compiled his Pāli Commentaries (Cv.xxxvii.215ff).[/p][p]When Dhātusena became king he had the walls of the Mahāvihāra painted with various ornamental designs (Cv.xxxviii.43).  The Dhammarucikas seem to have been favourites of this king and to have occupied the Mahāvihāra, later moving to Ambatthala vihāra (Cv.xxxviii.75).  Mahānāga instituted a permanent distribution of soup to the inhabitants of the Mahāvihāra (Cv.xli.99) and Jetthatissa III.  planted another Bodhi tree there, called the Mahāmetta (Cv.xliv.96).[/p][p]Udaya I.  built a new salāka hall (Cv.xlix.14).  Aggabodhi IX.  discontinued the habit of the monks of the smaller vihāras surrounding Anurādhapura from coming to Mahāvihāra for their supply of medicines and made other arrangements for their distribution (Cv.xlix.88).  Sena I.  and his queen Sanghā erected and endowed the Sanghasena parivena (Cv.l.70), while Kassapa IV.  built the Samuddagiri parivena and gave it for the use of the Pamsukūlikas, while for the forest dwelling monks of Mahāvihāra he built forest dwellings (Cv.lii.21f.; Cv.  Trs.i.163, n.8).  Kassapa's kinsman, the general Rakkha, built a vihāra in the village of Savāraka and gave it to the incumbents of Mahāvihāra, to be used as a padhānaghara, while Mahālekhasena built, in Mahāvihāra itself, the Mahālekhapabbata (Cv.lii.31ff).  Udaya IV.  gave a diadem of jewels to the Buddha image in Mahāvihāra, while his wife Vidurā added to it a network of rays made of precious stones (Cv.liii.49ff).[/p][p]During the invasions of the Colas and the Pandus from South India, and owing to the consequent confusion prevailing in the country, the Mahāvihāra seems to have been neglected.  Many of the buildings were destroyed and their priceless possessions plundered.  Discipline among the monks became slack and there were many dissensions.  Later, when Parakkamabāhu I.  had restored peace, he wished to purify the religion, but met with great opposition, and it was only after strenuous efforts that he brought about a reconciliation between the different parties (Cv.lxxviii.11ff).[/p][p]It is said (Cv.lxxviii.25) that the king could not find one single pure member of the Order.  He, therefore, held a special ordination ceremony, admitting many monks into the Order.  [/p][p]After the removal of the capital from Anurādhapura to Pulatthipura, Mahāvihāra lost its importance; the centre of activity was now at Pulatthipura, and later, at other capitals, and the Mahāvihāra fell into neglect and decay, from which it has never recovered.[/p]</entry>

He placed chairs for the preachers in all the vihāras of Ceylon, and laid out the grounds round Cetiyagiri, holding a great celebration called the Giribhandapūjā (q.v.).  From the Kadambanadī to Cetiyagiri he laid carpets for the comfort of pilgrims.  He built the Manināgapabbata, the Kalanda, the Samudda, and the Cūlānāgapabbata Vihāras, and gave land for the use of monks in Pāsānadīpaka and Mandavāpi Vihāras in gratitude for favours shown him by novices of these monasteries.

At Ap.ii.583, vs.  56; but there his father is called Kosiyagotta.  [/p][p]When he grew up he refused to marry in spite of the wishes of his parents; but in the end, to escape from their importunities, he agreed to marry if a wife could be found resembling a statue, which he had made.   [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bhadda_kapilani_thi,Bhaddā Kāpilānī')"]Bhaddā Kāpilānī[/a] was found at Sāgala to fulfil these conditions, and though the young people wrote to each other suggesting that somebody else should be found as a match for each, their letters were intercepted and they were married.  By mutual consent, however, the marriage was not consummated, the two spending the night separated by a chain of flowers.  Pippali had immense wealth; he used twelve measures of perfumed powder daily, each measure a Magadhanāli, for his person alone.  He had sixty lakes with water works attached, and his workmen occupied fourteen villages, each as large as  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/anuraadhapura,Anurādhapura')"]Anurādhapura[/a].  [/p][p]One day he went to a field, which was being ploughed and saw the birds eating the worms turned up by the plough.  On being told that the sin therein was his, he decided to renounce all his possessions.  [/p][p]At the same time, Bhaddā had been watching the crows eating the little insects, which ran about among the seamsum seeds that had been put out to dry, and when her attendant women told her that hers would be the sin for their loss of life, she also determined to renounce the world.[/p][p]The husband and wife, finding that they were of one accord, took yellow raiments from their wardrobe, cut off each other's hair, took bowls in their hands, and passed out through their weeping servants, to all of whom they granted their freedom, and departed together, Pippali walking in front.  But soon they agreed that it was not seemly they should walk thus together, as each must prove a hindrance to the other.  And so, at the cross roads, he took the right and she the left and the earth trembled to see such virtue.[/p][p]The Buddha, sitting in the  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/g/gandhakuti,Gandhakuti')"]Gandhakuti[/a] in  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/veluvana,Veluvana')"]Veluvana[/a], knew what the earthquake signified, and having walked three gāvutas (this journey of the Buddha is often referred to - e.g., MA.i.347, 357), sat down at the foot of the  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bahuputta,Bahuputtaka Nigrodha')"]Bahuputtaka Nigrodha[/a], between  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/r/raajagaha,Rājagaha')"]Rājagaha[/a] and  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/n/naalandaa,Nālandā')"]Nālandā[/a], resplendent in all the glory of a Buddha.  Pippali (henceforth called Mahā Kassapa, no explanation is to be found anywhere as to why he is called Kassapa; it was probably his gotta name, but see Ap.ii.583, vs.56) saw the Buddha, and recognising him at once as his teacher, prostrated himself before him.  The Buddha told him to be seated, and, in three homilies, gave him his ordination.[/p][p]The three homilies are given at S.ii.220, "Thus Kassapa must thou train thyself: [/p][ul][li](1) 'There shall be a lively sense of fear and regard (hirotappa) towards all monks, seniors, novices, and those of middle status.' [/li][li](2) 'Whatever doctrine I shall hear bearing upon what is good, to all that I will hearken with attentive ear, digesting it, pondering it, gathering it all up with my will.' [/li][li](3) 'Happy mindfulness with respect to the body shall not be neglected by me.'"[/li][/ul][p]Together they returned to Rājagaha, Kassapa, who bore on his body seven of the thirty two marks of a Great Being, following the Buddha.  On the way, the Buddha desired to sit at the foot of a tree by the roadside, and Kassapa folded for him his outer robe (pilotikasanghāti) as a seat.  The Buddha sat on it and, feeling it with his hand, praised its softness.  Kassapa asked him to accept it.  "And what would you wear?" inquired the Buddha.  Kassapa then begged that he might be given the rag robe worn by the Buddha.  "It is faded with use," said the Buddha, but Kassapa said he would prize it above the whole world and the robes were exchanged.  (The robe which Kassapa exchanged with the Buddha was Punnā's cloak.  See  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pu/punnaa,Punnā 6')"]Punnā 6[/a]).[/p][p]This incident Kassapa always recalled with pride, e.g.  S.ii.221. It is said that the Buddha paid him this great honour because he knew that Kassapa would hold a recital after his death, and thus help in the perpetuation of his religion, SA.ii.130. The earth quaked again in recognition of Kassapa's virtues, for no ordinary being would have been fit to wear the Buddha's cast off robe.  Kassapa, conscious of the great honour, took upon himself the thirteen austere vows (dhutagunā) and, after eight days, became an arahant.[/p][p]In the past Kassapa and Bhaddā had been husband and wife and companions in good works in many births.  In the time of  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/padumuttara,Padumuttara')"]Padumuttara[/a] Buddha Kassapa was a very rich householder named Vedeha and married to Bhaddā, and very devoted to the Buddha.  One day he heard the Buddha's third disciple in rank (Nisabha) being awarded the place of pre eminence among those who observed austere practices, and registered a wish for a similar honour for himself in the future.  He learnt from the Buddha of the qualities in which Nisabha excelled the Buddha himself, and determined to obtain them.  With this end in view, during birth after birth, he expended all his energies in goods deeds.  Ninety one kappas ago; in the time of  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/vipassii,Vipassī')"]Vipassī[/a] Buddha, he was the brahmin [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/e/ekasaataka,Ekasātaka')"]Ekasātaka[/a] and Bhaddā was his wife.

He married Bhaddā, but because of an evil deed she had done in the past (see Bhaddā Kāpilānī), she became unattractive to him and he left her, taking her as wife again when she became attractive.  Having seen from what had happened to his wife how great was the power of the Buddhas, the setthiputta wrapped Kassapa Buddha's golden cetiya with costly robes and decked it with golden lotuses, each the size of a cartwheel.  [/p][p]The Therī Apadāna (Ap.ii.582. vs.  47-51) gives an account of two more of his lives, one as Sumitta and the other as Koliyaputta, in both of which he and his wife ministered to Pacceka Buddhas.[/p][p]In the next birth he was  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/n/nanda,Nanda')"]Nanda[/a], king of Benares, and, because he had given robes in past lives, he had thirty two kapparukkhas, which provided him and all the people of his kingdom with garments.

In that life, too, Nanda and his queen renounced the world and became ascetics, and having developed the jhānas, were reborn in the Brahma world.  [/p][p]This account of Kassapa's last life and his previous life is compiled from AA.i.92ff.; SA.ii.135ff.; ThagA.ii.134ff.; Ap.ii.578ff.

It was then the seventh day after the Buddha's death, and the Mallas had been trying in vain to set fire to his pyre.  The arahant theras, who were present, declared that it could not be kindled until Mahā Kassapa and his five hundred companions had saluted the Buddha's feet.  Mahā Kassapa then arrived and walked three times round the pyre with bared shoulder, and it is said the Buddha's feet became visible from out of the pyre in order that he might worship them.  He was followed by his five hundred colleagues, and when they had all worshipped the feet disappeared and the pyre kindled of itself (D.ii.163f).  [/p][p]It is said (Mhv.xxxi.20f.; see also Vsm.430) that the relics of the Buddha which fell to Ajātasattu's share were taken to  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/r/raajagaha,Rājagaha')"]Rājagaha[/a] by Kassapa, in view of that which would happen in the future.  At  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/pava,Pāvā')"]Pāvā[/a] (on the announcement of the Buddha's death), Kassapa had heard the words of  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/subhadda,Subhadda')"]Subhadda[/a], who, in his old age, had joined the Order, that they were "well rid of the great samana and could now do as they liked." This remark it was which had suggested to Kassapa's mind the desirability of holding a Recital of the Buddha's teachings.  He announced his intention to the assembled monks, and, as the senior among them and as having been considered by the Buddha himself to be fit for such a task, he was asked to make all necessary arrangements (e.g., DA.i.3).  In accordance with his wishes, all the monks, other than the arahants chosen for the Recital, left Rājagaha during the rainy season.  The five hundred who were selected met in Council under the presidency of Kassapa and recited the Dhamma and the Vinaya (DA.i.3f.; 5ff.; Sp.i.4.ff.; Mhv.iii.3ff).  This recital is called the Therasangitī or  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/t/theravaada,Theravāda')"]Theravāda[/a].[/p][p]The books contain numerous references to Mahā Kassapa - he is classed with  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/maha_moggallana_th,Moggallāna')"]Moggallāna[/a], [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/maha_kappina_th,Kappina')"]Kappina[/a], and  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/anuruddha,Anuruddha')"]Anuruddha[/a] for his great iddhi-powers.  E.g., S.i.114; but his range of knowledge was limited; there were certain things which even Kassapa did not know (DhA.i.258).  [/p][p]The Buddha regarded him as equal to himself in exhorting the monks to lead the active and zealous lives (S.ii.205), and constantly held him up as an example to others in his great contentment (S.ii.194f) and his ability to win over families by his preaching.  The Buddha compares him to the moon (candopama), unobtrusive; his heart was free from bondage, and he always taught others out of a feeling of compassion.  S.ii.197ff.  Kassapa's freedom from any kind of attachment was, as the Buddha pointed out to the monks, due to the earnest wish he had made for that attainment in the past, "He has no attachment to requisites or households or monasteries or cells; but is like a royal swan which goes down into a lake and swims there, while the water does not adhere to his body" (DhA.ii.169f.).[/p][p]The Buddha also thought him equal to himself in his power of attaining the  [a href="http://www.palikanon.com/english/wtb/g_m/jhaana,jhānas')"]jhānas[/a] and abiding therein (S.ii.210ff).[/p][p]Kassapa was willing to help monks along their way, and several instances are given of his exhortations to them (E.g., Thag.vss.1051-57, 1072-81, and his long sermon at A.v.161ff ); but he was evidently sensitive to criticism, and would not address them unless he felt them to be tractable and deferential to instruction.  E.g., S.ii.203ff.; and at 219, when  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/t/thulla_nandaa,Thullanandā')"]Thullanandā[/a] finds fault with him for blaming  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/aa/aananda,Ananda')"]Ananda[/a].  See below.  Kassapa had good reason for not wishing to address recalcitrant monks.  The [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kutiduusaka_jat_321,Kutidūsaka Jātaka')"]Kutidūsaka Jātaka[/a] relates how one of his disciples, [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/ulunka_saddaka,Ulunka Saddaka')"]Ulunka Saddaka[/a], angered by some admonition from Kassapa, burnt the latter's grass hut while he was away on his alms round (J.iii.71f.).  [/p][p]He was very reluctant to preach to the nuns, but on one occasion he allowed himself to be persuaded by Ananda, and accompanied by him he visited the nunnery and preached to the nuns.  He was probably not popular among them, for, at the end of his discourse,  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/t/thulla_tissaa,Thullatissā')"]Thullatissā[/a] openly reviled him for what she called his impertinence in having dared to preach in the presence of Ananda, "as if the needle pedlar were to sell a needle to the needle maker." (S.ii.215f) Kassapa loved Ananda dearly, and was delighted when Ananda attained arahantship in time to attend the First Recital, and when Ananda appeared before the arahants, it was Kassapa who led the applause (DA.i.10f).  But Kassapa was very jealous of the good name of the Order, and we find him (S.ii.218f) blaming Ananda for admitting into the Order new members incapable of observing its discipline and of going about with them in large numbers, exposing the Order to the criticism of the public.  "A corn trampler art thou, Ananda," he says, "a despoiler of families, thy following is breaking up, thy youngsters are melting away," and ends up with "The boy, methinks, does not know his own measure." Ananda, annoyed at being called "boy," protests "Surely my head is growing grey hairs, your reverence." This incident, says the Commentary took place after the Buddha's death, when Ananda, as a new arahant and with all the honour of his intimacy with the Buddha, whose bowl and robe he now possessed, had become a notable personage.  SA.ii.133; Ananda regarded Kassapa in some sort of way as a teacher, and held him in great respect, not daring to mention even his name, lest it should imply disrespect (see Vin.i.92f.).  [/p][p]Thullanandā heard Kassapa censuring Ananda and raised her voice in protest, "What now? Does Kassapa, once a heretic, deem that he can chide the learned sage Ananda?" Kassapa was hurt by her words, and complained to Ananda that such things should be said of him who had been singled out by the Buddha for special honour.[/p][p]Kassapa viewed with concern the growing laxity among members of the Order with regard to the observance of rules, even in the very lifetime of the Buddha, and the falling off in the number of those attaining arahantship, and we find him consulting the Buddha as to what should be done.  S.ii.224f.  At the First Council, when Ananda stated that the Buddha had given leave for the monks to do away with the minor rules of the Order, Kassapa was opposed to any such step, lest it should lead to slackness among the monks and contempt from the laity (Vin.ii.287f.).  [/p][p]Kassapa himself did his utmost to lead an exemplary life, dwelling in the forest, subsisting solely on alms, wearing rag robes, always content with little, holding himself aloof from society, ever strenuous and energetic.  See also the  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahagosinga_s,Mahāgosinga Sutta')"]Mahāgosinga Sutta[/a] (M.i.214), where Kassapa declares his belief in the need for these observances; that his example was profitable to others is proved by the case of  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/somamitta_thera,Somamitta')"]Somamitta[/a] who, finding his own teacher [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/vimala,Vimala')"]Vimala[/a] given up to laziness, sought Kassapa and attained arahantship under his guidance.  [/p][p]When asked why he led such a life, he replied that it was not only for his own happiness but also out of compassion for those who came after him, that they might attain to the same end.  Even when he was old and the Buddha himself had asked him to give up his coarse rag robe and to dwell near him, he begged to be excused.  S.ii.202f; but See  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/j/jotidaasa,Jotidāsa')"]Jotidāsa[/a], who is said to have built a vihāra for Kassapa, and entertained him.  [/p][p]Once, when Kassapa lay grievously ill at  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pu/pipphaliguha,Pipphaliguhā')"]Pipphaliguhā[/a], the Buddha visited him and reminded him of the seven  [a href="http://www.palikanon.com/english/wtb/b_f/bojjhanga,bojjhangas')"]bojjhangas[/a] which he had practised (S.v.78).  [/p][p]The knowledge that he had profited by the Master's teaching, we are told (SA.iii.128), calmed his blood and purified his system, and the sickness fell away from him "like a drop of water from a lotus leaf." He disdained being waited upon by anybody, even by a goddess such as  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/l/laja,Lājā')"]Lājā[/a], lest he should set a bad example (DhA.iii.6ff).[/p][p]Owing to his great saintliness, even the gods vied with each other to give alms to Kassapa.  Once when he had risen from a trance lasting seven days, five hundred nymphs, wives of  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sakka,Sakka')"]Sakka[/a], appeared before him; but, snapping his fingers, he asked them to depart, saying that he bestowed his favours only on the poor.  [/p][p]The story of Kālavilangika is an example of Kassapa's compassion for the poor.  Once, after a seven days' trance, he went to the house of Kālavilanga and received alms from his wife, which he gave to the Buddha for their greater benefit.  The Buddha took a portion of this and gave the rest to five hundred monks.  Kālavilangika, received only a mouthful of the food left.  The Buddha said that as a result he would be a setthi within seven days.  Kālavilangika told this to his wife.  It happened that a few days later the king saw a man impaled alive in the place of execution; the man begged him for some food, which he agreed to send.  At night, when eating, the king remembered his promise, but could find no one bold enough to go to the cemetery.  On the offer of one thousand pieces, Kālavilangika's wife agreed to go in the guise of a man.  On the way she was stopped by the yakkha  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/diighataphala,Dīghataphala')"]Dīghataphala[/a], who, however, later released her and gave her treasure, as did also the yakkha's father in law, the deva  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/sumana,Sumana')"]Sumana[/a].  The man ate the food and, when wiping his mouth, recognised her as a woman and caught hold of her hair.  But she cut off her hair, and proved to the satisfaction of the king that her mission had been accomplished.  She then recovered the treasure given her by the yakkha and Sumana; when the king discovered her wealth, she and her husband were raised to the rank of setthi (MA.ii.812ff.).[/p][p]When Sakka heard of this, he disguised himself as a weaver worn with age, and accompanied by  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/sujaataa,Sujātā')"]Sujātā[/a], transformed into an old woman, appeared in a weaver's hut along the lane where Kassapa was begging.  The ruse succeeded and Kassapa accepted their alms; but, later, be discovered the truth and chided Sakka.  Sakka begged forgiveness, and, on being assured that in spite of his deception the almsgiving would bring him merit, he flew into the air shouting, "Aho dānam, mahā danam, Kassapassa patitthitam." The Buddha heard this and sympathised with Sakka in his great joy (DhA.i.423ff.; cp.  Ud.iii.7).  [/p][p]But on one occasion so great was the importunity with which the monks of  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/aa/aalavii,Alavi')"]Alavi[/a] had wearied the people, that even Mahā Kassapa failed to get alms from them (J.ii.282).  The Visuddhi Magga (403) relates a story of how once, when Kassapa was begging for alms in Rājagaha, in the company of the Buddha, on a festival day, five hundred maidens were going to the festival carrying cakes, "round like the moon." They saw the Buddha but passed him by, and gave their cakes to Kassapa.  The Elder made all the cakes fill just his single bowl and offered it to the Buddha (This is probably the incident referred to at Vsm.68).[/p][p] [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/saariputta,Sāriputta')"]Sāriputta[/a] seems to have held Kassapa in great esteem, and the  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kassapa_sam,Kassapa Samyutta')"]Kassapa Samyutta[/a] contains two discussions between them: one on the necessity for zeal and ardour in the attainment of Nibbāna (S.ii.195f), and the other on the existence of a  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/t/tathaagata,Tathāgata')"]Tathāgata[/a] after death (S.ii.222f).

Later, the hawks had two sons, who lived on the island.  One day, some men, wandering about in search of food, lay down under the tree where the hawks lived and kindled a fire to keep away the insects.  The smoke disturbed the young ones and they set up a cry.  The men, hearing this, wished to get the birds for their food.  But the she hawk, perceiving the danger, sent her husband to summon their friends.  First came the osprey who brought water in his wings and quenched the fire every time it was lighted; when he was tired, the tortoise sent his son with mud from the lake, which he put on the fire.

The citizens of Benares once invited the Buddha and his monks and went about asking people to help in their entertainment.  In spite of their extreme poverty, Mahāduggata and his wife undertook to look after one monk; they both worked hard to earn the necessary money and then prepared a simple meal.  Sakka, knowing what was to come, came in the guise of a labourer to help them.  When the time came for the meal it was found that in allotting the monks to their several hosts, Mahāduggata's house had been overlooked.  Mahāduggata wrung his hands and burst into tears, but somebody pointed out to him that nobody was yet entertaining the Buddha.  He, therefore, went to the vihāra and invited the Buddha, who accepted the invitation, while princes and nobles waited outside wishing to conduct him to their own palaces.  The Buddha ate the food prepared by Mahāduggata and Sakka and returned thanks.  That same day, by the power of Sakka, the seven kinds of jewels fell from the sky and filled Mahāduggata's house, and when it was reported to the king that he was the wealthiest man in the city, he was appointed Treasurer.  Mahāduggata built a new house and discovered many hidden treasures while digging the foundations.

When the king left, he told the man that his name was Mahā Assāroha, and asked him to visit his home if ever he should be in the city.  On reaching the city himself, he gave orders to the gate keepers that if anyone should come enquiring for Mahā Assāroha, he should be brought at once to the palace.

<entry>[div class="huge"]1. Mahākapi Jātaka (No.  407)[/div][/blockquote][p]The Bodhisatta was once a monkey, leader of eighty thousand.  In the grove where they lived was a mango tree (some say a banyan) growing on a river bank bearing fruit of divine flavour, and the monkeys were always careful to let no fruit drop into the river.  But one day a fruit, which bad been hidden by an ants' nest, fell into the water, and was picked up at Benares, where the king was bathing.  The king tasted it, and being seized with a desire to eat more, had many rafts made, and ascended the river with a company of foresters.  They found the tree, and the king, having eaten his fill, lay down at the foot.  At midnight the Bodhisatta came with his retinue and started eating the mangoes.  The king was disturbed, and gave orders to his archers that the wood should be surrounded and all the monkeys shot at daybreak.  But the Bodhisatta was a real leader; he ascended a straight-growing branch and, with one leap, reached the river bank.  He then marked the distance, and having cut off a bamboo shoot of the required length, fastened one end to a tree on the bank and the other end round his waist.  On leaping back, he found he had not allowed for the length which went round his waist, but grasping a branch firmly with both hands, he signalled to his followers to cross the bridge so formed.  The eighty thousand monkeys thus escaped; but the monkey who was  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/devadatta,Devadatta')"]Devadatta[/a], coming last, saw a chance of injuring the Bodhisatta, and taking a spring into the air, fell on the Bodhisatta's back, breaking it, There the Bodhisatta hung in agony, and the king who had seen all this caused him to be brought down and covered with a yellow robe and ministered to.  But nothing could be done, and the Bodhisatta died after having admonished the king.  A funeral pyre was made with one hundred wagon loads of timber, and the dead monkey was paid all the honours due to a king.  A shrine was built on the spot where the cremation took place, while the skull was inlaid with gold and taken to Benares, where a great feast was held in its honour for seven days.  Afterwards it was enshrined and offerings were made to it.[/p][p]The story was told concerning good works towards one's relations, as narrated in the introduction to the Bhaddasāla Jātaka.

He became king of Ceylon (334-361 A.C.), and under the advice of his teacher Sanghamitta and his minister Sona, he despoiled Mahāvihāra and enriched Abhayagiri.  He issued a decree that no one should give alms to the monks of Mahāvihāra.  But, later, his friend and minister, Meghavannābhaya, convinced him of his error, and he became a supporter of Mahāvihāra.  Soon after, however, he fell under the influence of a monk, named Tissa, and built Jetavanaviharā in the precincts of Mahāvihāra, despite the protests of the monks.  Tissa was later expelled from the Order.  The king built the Manihīra, Gokanna, Erakāvilla, Kalandagāma, Migagāma, Gangāsenakapabbata, Dhātusenapabbata, Kokavāta, Rūpārāma, and Hulapitthi vihāras and two nunneries Uttara and Abhaya.

  <entry>[div class="huge"]Mahāsupina Jātaka (No.  77)[/div][p]Pasenadi, king of Kosala, had, one night, sixteen bad dreams, and his brahmins, on being consulted, said that they presaged harm either to his kingdom, his life, or his wealth, and prescribed all manner of sacrifices in order to avert the danger (It is perhaps this sacrifice which is referred to at S.i.75).  [/p][p]Mallikā, the king's wife, heard of this and suggested that the Buddha should be consulted.  The king followed her advice, and the Buddha explained the dreams.  [/p][ul][li]The first dream was of wild bulls entering the royal courtyard to fight but retiring after roaring and bellowing.  This, said the Buddha, meant that, in future, when wicked kings rule, rain clouds will gather, but there will be no rain.  [/li][li]The second dream was of trees and shrubs sprouting from the earth which flowered and bore fruit when only about one span high.  This foretold a time when men would be short lived owing to their lusts.  [/li][li]In the third dream cows sucked calves which were hardly a day old.  This showed that, in the future, the young would refuse respect to the old.  [/li][li]The fourth dream was of sturdy draught oxen standing by, while young steers tried to draw loads.  This signified a time when the administration of affairs will be entrusted to the young and inexperienced, while the wise and old stand by.  [/li][li]The fifth dream was of a horse which ate from two mouths, one on either side of its body, which foretold a time when the king's justices will take bribes from contending parties and give themselves to corruption.  [/li][li]The sixth dream was of people holding a very valuable golden bowl and asking a jackal to stale therein.  This shows that, in the future, kings will exalt the low born and noble maidens will be mated with upstarts.  [/li][li]The seventh dream was of a man holding a rope which he trailed at his feet, while a she jackal kept on eating it.  This foretold a time when women will lose their sense of modesty and behave badly.  [/li][li]In the eighth dream was a big pitcher at the palace gates filled with water and surrounded by empty ones.  This foretold a time when kings will be poor and set the whole country working for them, the people being left in extreme poverty.  [/li][li]The ninth dream was of a deep pool with sloping banks overgrown with lotus.  Men and beasts entered the pond; the middle was muddy, but at the edges was crystal water.  This meant that in the future there would be unrighteous kings oppressing the people, who would leave the capital and take refuge in the frontier districts.  [/li][li]The tenth dream was of rice cooking in a pot, which rice, instead of cooking evenly, remained in three parts: some sodden, some raw, some well cooked; this showed that in the future men of all classes, even brahmins and sages, will be wicked, the very forces of nature will be against them, and their harvest will be spoiled.  [/li][li]The eleventh dream was of men bartering butter milk for precious sandal wood, and presaged a time when the Dhamma would decay and its votaries clamour for money and gifts.  [/li][li]The twelfth dream was of empty pumpkins sinking in the water; the world will be reversed: the low born will become great lords and the noble sink into poverty.  [/li][li]In the thirteenth dream solid blocks of rock floated in the water; nobles and wise men will be scorned while upstarts shall have their own way.  [/li][li]In the fourteenth dream tiny frogs chewed huge snakes and ate them; a time will come when men, because of their lusts, will become the slaves of their wives and be ruled by them.  [/li][li]The fifteenth dream was of a wicked village crow attended by mallards; kings will arise, ignorant and cowardly, who will rise to power, not their peers, but their footmen, barbers, and the like; nobles will be reduced to waiting on these upstarts.  [/li][li]In the sixteenth dream goats chased panthers, devouring them; the lowborn will be raised to lordship and nobles will sink into obscurity and distress; when the latter plead for their rights, the king's minions will have them cudgelled and bastinadoed.[/li][/ul][p]Having thus explained the dreams, the Buddha told Pasenadi a story of the past.  A king of Benares, named Brahmadatta, had dreams similar to those of Pasenadi.  When he consulted the brahmins, they began to prepare sacrifices.  A young brahmin protested, saying that animal sacrifice was against the teaching of the Vedas, but they would not listen.  The Bodhisatta, who was a hermit in the Himālaya, possessed of insight, became aware of what was happening, travelled through the air and took his seat in the park.  There he was seen by a young brahmin, who brought the king to the park.  The Bodhisatta heard the king's dreams and explained them to his satisfaction.[/p][p]Ananda was the king and Sāriputta the young brahmin.  J.i.334-45.[/p]</entry>

  <entry>[div class="huge"]Mahā Kappina Thera[/div][p]One of the most eminent disciples of the Buddha, considered foremost among those who taught the monks (bhikkuovādakānam) (A.i.25).  He was older than the Buddha, and was born in a frontier kingdom three hundred yojanas in extent, in the city of Kukkutavatī.  On the death of his father he became rājā under the name of Mahā Kappina.  His chief wife was  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/anojaa,Anojā')"]Anojā[/a], from  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sagala,Sāgala')"]Sāgala[/a] in the Madda kingdom.  She had been his companion in good works in past births.  Every morning Mahā Kappina would send men out of the four gates of the city to stop any scholarly or learned men who might happen to pass along the road, and then to return and tell him of them.  He owned five horses: Vāla, Puppha, Vālavāhana, Pupphavāhana and Supatta.  Supatta he alone rode, the others were used by his messengers.  One day, after the Buddha's appearance in the world, traders came from Sāvatthi to Kukkutavatī and, after disposing of their goods, went to see Mahā Kappina.  He received them and asked them about their country and the teaching (sāsana) which they followed.  "Sire," they replied, “we cannot tell you with unwashed mouths." A golden jug of water was brought, and with cleansed mouths and clasped hands they told the king of the appearance of the Buddha.  At the word "Buddha" Kappina's body was suffused with rapture.  He made them utter the word three times, giving them one hundred thousand pieces.  The men told him also of the Dhamma and the Sangha, and he trebled his gifts and forthwith renounced the world, followed by his ministers.  They set forth to find the Buddha, and reached the bank of a river which they crossed by an "Act of Truth," saying, "If this teacher be a Sammāsambuddha, let not even a hoof of these horses be wetted." In this manner they crossed three rivers: the Aravacchā, the Nīlavāhana (q.v.), and the Candabhāgā.  The Buddha perceived them with his divine eye, and after he had eaten at Sāvatthi, went through the air to the banks of the Candabhāgā (one hundred and twenty yojanas, says J.iv.180; see also SNA.ii.440) and sat down under the great banyan tree facing the landing stage of the river, sending forth Buddha rays.  Kappina and his men saw him and prostrated themselves.  The Buddha taught them the Doctrine, and they became arahants and joined the Order, the formula "Ehi bhikkhu" being their sanction and their ordination.  But see Vsm.393, where it says that at the end of the sermon Kappina became only an anāgāmin and his followers sotāpannas.[/p][p]Anojā and the wives of Kappina's ministers hearing that their husbands had renounced the world and gone to see the Buddha, determined to do likewise.  They crossed the river in the same way as Kappina and his retinue, and approached the Buddha as he sat under the banyan tree on the banks of the Candabhāgā.  The Buddha made the husbands and wives invisible to each other and preached to the latter.  They became sotāpannas and were ordained by Uppalavannā, the Buddha taking the monks to Jetavana.  Mahā Kappina spent his days in the ecstasy of jhāna, and so full of happiness was he that he constantly repeated "aho sukham, aho sukham," which made the monks suspect that he was longing for the pleasures of kingship which he had left behind, until the Buddha dispelled their doubts.[/p][p]One day the Buddha discovered that Kappina lived inactively, enjoying his happiness, and that he never taught anybody.  (Vin.i.105 records that when Kappina was in the Deer Park at Maddakucchi he wondered whether he need attend the uposatha ceremonies, since he himself was pure).  The Buddha appeared before him, telling him to go.  He sent for him and asked him to teach the Doctrine to his associates.  This Kappina did, and at the end of a single sermon one thousand listening recluses became arahants, hence the title conferred on him.  [/p][p]In the time of Padumuttara Buddha, Kappina had registered a vow to become chief among admonishers of monks, having seen a similar honour conferred on a disciple of the Buddha.  He was at that time an assessor (akkhadassa) of Hamsavatī, and having invited the Buddha and his monks entertained them with great honour.  In another birth he was a Koliyan, and waited upon five hundred Pacceka Buddhas and gave them robes.  The story of the entertainment of the Pacceka Buddhas is given at length in DhA.ii.112ff., and the number given there is one thousand.  They came to Benares, but the king, occupied with the ploughing festival, asked them to return on the third day.  The wife of the senior weaver of a village near by heard this and invited the Pacceka Buddhas to her village, where there were one thousand artisans.  On the invitation being accepted, she returned quickly to the village, told the people of what she had done, and they all made the necessary preparations, each family looking after one Pacceka Buddha.  The Pacceka Buddhas, by their own wish, stayed on for three months, the same woman seeing to all their comforts.  At the end of their visit, she persuaded each family to give a set of robes to its own Pacceka Buddha.  The senior weaver was Kappina and his wife Anojā.  [/p][p]In the time of Kassapa Buddha, he was the leader of a guild of one thousand men and built a great parivena containing one thousand rooms.  AA.i.175ff.; ThagA.i.507ff.; SA.ii.172ff.; DhA.ii.117ff.  gives a more detailed and slightly different version; ep.  Avadānas.ii.102f.[/p][p]It is said (DhA.ii.115f) that once Kassapa Buddha was preaching and that all the householders of Benares, with their families, went to hear him.  Scarcely had they entered the monastery when there was a heavy downpour of rain.  Those who had friends among the novices and monks found shelter in their cells, the others were unprotected.  The senior householder then suggested that they should build a great monastery so that all might be sheltered in future; the others agreeing, he himself gave one thousand, each of the other men five hundred, and each woman two hundred and fifty.  The monastery had one thousand pinnacles, and when money ran short, each gave half as much again.  At the dedication ceremony the festival lasted for seven days.  The senior householder's wife, Anojā, offered the Buddha a casket of anoja flowers and placed at his feet a garment of the colour of the flowers worth one thousand, and made a wish that in future births her body should be of the colour of the anoja flower.[/p][p]Although Kappina was famed as a teacher of monks, the Theragāthā, curiously enough, contains verses in which he admonishes the nuns (bhikkhuniyo) (Thag.vss.  547 556; ThagA.i.511).[/p][p]Kappina is described by the Buddha as pale (? odāta), thin, and having a prominent nose (tanukam tunganāsikam).  He possessed great iddhi-powers and had attained every samāpatti, which could be attained (J.ii.284).  (It was owing to his iddhi powers that he was able to follow the Buddha to the Brahma world, S.i.145; see also S.v.315, where he is described as samādhibhāvanīya).  It has been remarked (Brethren, p.257 n.2) that the verses attributed to him are, for the most part, more gnomic sayings of popular philosophy than genuine Dhamma, and that they would have befitted an early Greek Pagan.  Mrs.  Rhys Davids (J.R.A.S.  1927, ii.p.206f; also Sākya, p.140) has an interesting theory that Kappina was Assaji's teacher.[/p][p]Mahā Kappina was quite often in the company of Sāriputta, and it is said (Thag.vs.1086) that once, seeing the profound homage the gods payed to his colleague, he smiled by way of congratulation.[/p][p]See also Kappina Sutta.[/p]</entry>

It was probably the chief port f or vessels plying between South India and Ceylon.  Thus, it was from there that Sakkasenāpati embarked for the Pandu country (Cv.lii.73), and there that the Pandu king landed from Cola (Cv.liii.5).  The expeditionary force of Vijayabāhu I.  embarked there for Cola (Cv.lx.34), as did the forces of Parakkamabāhu I.  under Lankāpura (Cv.lxxvi.83).  [/p][p]It was a convenient place for preparations to be made before advancing on the capital, or merely journeying thither (thus Cv.lxviii.81; Cv.li.28).

  <entry>[div class="huge"]Mahāsīhanāda Sutta[/div][p]Preached at the Mahāvana in Vesāli.  Sāriputta tells the Buddha that Sunakkhatta, who had recently left the Order, went about saying that there was nothing marvellous about the Buddha's knowledge and insight and that his teachings did not lead to the end of Ill.  The Buddha says that Sunakkhatta is a man of wrath and folly and incapable of appreciating the good either of the Tathāgata or of his teachings.  He then issues his challenge to the effect that no one can deny to the Tathāgata the possession of ten powers, (balā) - which are enumerated - and the four confidences (vesārajjā).  The Tathāgata can attend any of the eight assemblies without fear; he knows the various classifications of beings, the birth of beings, the way to Nibbāna; he can read the minds of men and the five destinies which await different beings.  He has lived the fourfold higher life being foremost in his practice of asceticism, in loathliness, in scrupulosity, in solitude.  No one has surpassed him in the practice of these things.  He has discovered, by experimentation, the futility of the claims of those who maintain that purity comes by way of food, or offering, or ritual.  Though eighty years old and his body broken down, yet his powers of mind are at their prime; even if he must be carried on a litter, yet will his mind retain its powers (M.i.68 83).[/p][p]Nāgasamāla, who is by, asks the Buddha for a title for the discourse, and the Buddha gives it the name of Lomahamsapariyāya.  cp.

Viewed from the city of Anurādhapura, the right bank was called pāragangā and the left oragangā.  The river was of great strategic importance, and is mentioned in various accounts of campaigns between opposing armies.  It was always regarded as the boundary between North Ceylon, with Anurādhapura (and later, Pulatthipura) as the centre, and the South east province of Rohana.  [/p][p]Various fords on this river are mentioned in the books, the chief among these being Kacchakatittha, Ganthambatittha, Mahārukkhatittha, Mālāgāmatittha, Yakkhasūkaratittha, Sarogāmatittha, Sahassatittha and Suvannatthambhatittha.  There were evidently other fords at the bends of the river with no particular names (e.g., Cv.lxxii.285).  [/p][p]The kings of Ceylon constructed various canals branching off from the river to help in their irrigation schemes.  One such was the Pabbatanta Canal, built by Mahāsena (Mhv.xxxvii.50); while the Aciravatī, the Gomatī, and the Malāpaharani were constructed by Parakkamabāhu I.  (Cv.lxxix.51f).  Dhātusena irrigated the surrounding fields by means of damming up the river (Cv.xxxviii.12), as did Sena II.  by the construction of the Manimekhala dam (Cv.li.72).

  <entry>[div class="huge"]Mahādhammapāla Jātaka (No.  447)[/div][p]In Dhammapāla, a village of Kāsi, there lived a family whose head was Mahādhammapāla.  The Bodhisatta was his son, and was called Dhammapala-kumāra.  He went to study at Takkasilā.  There the teacher's eldest son died, but among all the lamentations it was noticed that Dhammapāla did not weep.  When questioned by his fellows as to how he could refrain, he answered that as it was impossible for anybody young to die, he did not believe his friend was dead.  The teacher asked him about this, and found that in Dhammapāla's family no one died young.  Wishing to know if this were true, he left Takkasilā and went to the home of Dhammapāla, carrying with him the bones of a goat.  After his welcome had subsided, he announced to Dhammapāla that his son was dead, and begged him not to grieve.  But Dhammapāla clapped his hands and laughed, saying that such a thing could never be as no member of their family ever died young.  He then told the brahmin, in answer to his query, that they owed their longevity to the fact that they lived good lives.[/p][p]The story was related to Suddhodana, who told the Buddha how, when the Buddha was practising severe penances, some gods came to him (Suddhodana) and said that he was dead.  But he refused to believe them.  Suddhodana was Mahādhammapāla and the teacher Sāriputta (J.iv.50 55).

But Pajāpatī and her companions, nothing daunted, had barbers to cut off their hair, and donning yellow robes, followed the Buddha to Vesāli on foot.  They arrived with wounded feet at the Buddha's monastery and repeated their request.  The Buddha again refused, but Ananda interceded on their behalf and their request was granted, subject to eight strict conditions.  [/p][p]For details see Vin.ii.253ff.; also A.iv.274ff.  There was some question, which arose later as to the procedure of Pajāpatī's ordination, which was not formal.  When the nuns discovered this some of them refused to hold the uposatha with her.  But the Buddha declared that he himself had ordained her and that all was in order (DhA.iv.149).  Her upasampadā consisted in acquiescing in the eight conditions laid down for nuns (Sp.i.242).[/p][p]After her ordination, Pajāpatī came to the Buddha and worshipped him.  The Buddha preached to her and gave her a subject for meditation.  With this topic she developed insight and soon after won arahantship, while her five hundred companions attained to the same after listening to the  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/n/nandakovada_s,Nandakovāda Sutta')"]Nandakovāda Sutta[/a].  Later, at an assembly of monks and nuns in  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/j/jetavana,Jetavana')"]Jetavana[/a], the Buddha declared Pajāpatī chief of those who had experience (rattaññūnam) (A.i.25).  Not long after, while at Vesāli, she realized that her life had come to an end.  She was one hundred and twenty years old; she took leave of the Buddha, performed various miracles, and then died, her five hundred companions dying with her.  It is said that the marvels which attended her cremation rites were second only to those of the Buddha.[/p][p]It was in the time of  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/padumuttara,Padumuttara')"]Padumuttara[/a] Buddha that Pajāpatī made her resolve to gain eminence.  She then belonged to a clansman's family in Hamsavatī, and, hearing the Buddha assign the foremost place in experience to a certain nun, wished for similar recognition herself, doing many good deeds to that end.  After many births she was born once more at Benares, forewoman among five hundred slave girls.  When the rains drew near, five Pacceka Buddhas came from Nandamūlaka to Isipatana seeking lodgings.  Pajāpatī saw them after the Treasurer had refused them any assistance, and, after consultation with her fellow slaves, they persuaded their several husbands to erect five huts for the Pacceka Buddhas during the rainy season and they provided them with all requisites.  At the end of the rains they gave three robes to each Pacceka Buddha.  After that she was born in a weaver's village near Benares, and again ministered, this time to five hundred Pacceka Buddhas, sons of  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/padumavati,Padumavatī')"]Padumavatī[/a] (ThigA.140ff.; AA.i.185f.; Ap.ii.529 43).[/p][p]It is said that once Pajāpatī made a robe for the Buddha of wonderful material and marvellously elaborate.  But when it came to be offered to the Buddha he refused it, and suggested it should be given to the Order as a whole.  Pajāpatī was greatly disappointed, and  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/aa/aananda,Ananda')"]Ananda[/a] intervened.  But the Buddha explained that his suggestion was for the greater good of Pajāpatī, and also as an example to those who might wish to make similar gifts in the future.  This was the occasion for the preaching of the  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/dakkhinaavibhanga_s,Dakkhināvibhanga Sutta')"]Dakkhināvibhanga Sutta[/a] (M.iii.253ff.; MA.ii.1001ff.; this incident is referred to in the Milinda p.240).

  <entry>[div class="huge"]Mahābodhi Jātaka (No.  528)[/div][p]The Bodhisatta was born in an Udiccabrahmin family, and, on growing up, renounced the world.  His name was Bodhi.  [/p][p]Once, during the rains, he came to Benares, and, at the invitation of the king, stayed in the royal park.  The king had five councillors, unjust men, who sat in the judgment hall giving unjust judgments.  One day a man, who had been very badly treated by them, asked Bodhi to intervene.  Bodhi reheard the case and decided in his favour.  The people applauded, and the king begged Bodhi to dispense justice in his court.  Bodhi reluctantly agreed and twelve years passed.  The former councillors, deprived of their gains, plotted against Bodhi and constantly poisoned the king's mind against him; they first decreased all the honours paid to Bodhi, and when this failed to drive him away, obtained the king's permission to kill him.  [/p][p]A tawny dog, to whom Bodhi used to give food from his bowl, overheard the plot, and, when Bodhi approached the palace the next day, bared his teeth and barked as a warning of the conspiracy.  Bodhi understood, returned to his hut, and, in spite of the king's expression of remorse, left the city, promising to return later, and dwelt in a frontier village.  The councillors, nervous lest Bodhi should return, informed the king that Bodhi and the queen were conspiring to slay him.  Believing their words, he had the queen put to death.  The queen's four sons thereupon rose in revolt, and the king was in great danger and fear.  [/p][p]When Bodhi heard of this, he took a dried monkey skin, went to Benares, and stayed again in the royal park.  The king came to do him honour, but Bodhi sat silent, stroking the monkey skin.  The king asked him why he did so.  He answered, "This monkey was of the greatest service to me; I travelled about on its back, it carried my water pot, swept out my dwelling, and performed various other duties for me; in the end, through its simplicity, I ate its flesh and now I sit and lie on its skin." [/p][blockquote][p](He had used the skin for his garment, hence "I sat on the monkey's back"; he had the skin on his shoulder, whence his water pot was suspended, hence "it carried the water pot"; he had swept the cell with the skin, hence "swept my dwelling place"; he had eaten the flesh of the monkey, hence "I ate its flesh").  [/p][/blockquote][p]The councillors who were present made great uproar, calling him a murderer and a traitor.  But Bodhi knew that of these councillors, one denied the effect of all kamma, one attributed everything to a Supreme Being, one believed that everything was a result of past actions, one believed in annihilation, and one held the khattiya doctrine that one should secure one's interests, even to the extent of killing one's parents.  He, therefore, argued with one after another, and proved that in accordance with their doctrines no blame whatever attached to him for having killed the monkey.  Having thus completed their discomfiture, he exhorted the king not to trust in slanderers, and asked the king's sons to obtain their father's pardon.  The king wished the councillors to be killed, but Bodhi intervened, and they were disgraced and exiled from the kingdom, their hair fastened in five locks.[/p][p]The story was related in the same circumstances as the  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahaummagga_jat_546,Mahāummagga Jātaka')"]Mahāummagga Jātaka[/a].

His parents possessed eighty crores, and, for all education, he learnt music and singing.  He married the daughter of an equally rich family and of similar education.  After the death of their parents, they were very rich.  One night, as the husband was on his way from the palace, some knaves tempted him to drink.  He soon fell a victim to the habit and all his wealth was squandered.  Then he spent his wife's money, and finally sold all his belongings, and used to go about begging, a potsherd in his hand.  One day the Buddha, seeing him waiting outside the refectory for leavings of food, smiled.  In answer to Ananda, who asked him the reason for his smile, the Buddha said that there was a man who had had the power of becoming chief Treasurer or attaining arahantship, if he did but use his opportunities, but he was now reduced to beggary, like a heron in a dried up pond.

Five hundred thieves once attempted unsuccessfully to enter his house, but hearing that he was about to travel through a forest with five hundred carts laden with goods, they lay in wait for him.  The merchant took with him five hundred monks and entertained them in a village at the entrance to the forest.  As he tarried there several days, the thieves sent a man to find out when he might be setting out, which he learnt would be soon.  The villagers warned the merchant of the thieves' intention, and he gave up the idea of the journey and decided to return home.  But on hearing that the thieves were lying in ambush on tile homeward road, he stayed in the village.  The monks returned to Jetavana and told the Buddha, who taught them that men should avoid evil even as Mahādhana avoided thieves.  DhA.iii.21f.[/p][hr][p][b]3. Mahādhana.[/b] A merchant of Benares.  On his way to Sāvatthi with five hundred carts filled with cloth of the colour of safflower, he came to the river and unyoked his oxen, thinking to cross on the morrow.  In the night it rained and there was a flood.  For seven days the rain continued, and Mahādhana decided to stay until his wares were sold and then return home.  The Buddha, on his begging rounds, saw him and smiled.  When asked the reason by Ananda, he said that the man, in spite of all his plans, had only seven days to live.  With the Buddha's permission, Ananda warned Mahādhana, who thereupon invited the Buddha and his monks and entertained them.  At the end of the meal the Buddha preached to him and he became a Sotāpanna.  Shortly after he was seized with pain in the head and died immediately, to be re born in Tusita.

The boy, when grown up, married a woman likewise of no education.  After the death of his father, he squandered all his wealth and sought refuge in a destitute's home (anāthasālā).  Thieves saw him there, and as he was young and strong enlisted his services.  One night the thieves broke into a house, but the owner awoke and pursued them, catching Mahādhana's son, who was brought before the king.  The king ordered him to be beheaded.  The courtesan of the city, Sulasā, saw him being led to execution, and remembering their past friendship, gave him sweetmeats and drink, bribing the guard to let him have them.  At that moment Moggallāna, seeing the youth's fate with his divine eye, appeared before him and was given some sweetmeats.  After execution, the man was born as a tree sprite, and one day carried  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/sulasaa,Sulasā')"]Sulasā[/a] off as she was walking in the park and kept her for a week.  Sulasā's mother consulted Moggallāna on her disappearance, and was told she would return to Veluvana at the end of a week, When the time came, the sprite brought Sulasā back and left her on the edge of the crowd which was listening to the Buddha's preaching at Veluvana.

It gives an account of the general events attendant on the advent of a Buddha, and gives various facts connected with the Buddhas, with details of seven Buddhas by way of illustration.  But it is only the life of Vipassī, the first of the seven Buddhas preceding Gotama, which is at all elaborately treated.  [/p][p]The sutta was preached at the Karerimandapa in Jetavana, and was the result of a conversation among the monks, in which they expressed the desire to know something of the births of previous Buddhas (D.ii.6 54).  It is noteworthy that the Cullaniddesa (p.  80) cites the sutta as a typical example of the earlier Jātakas.  Some regard it as the basis of the Mahāvastu.  [/p][p]The sutta is held in great esteem and is called in the Commentaries (E.g., DA.ii.480) the "King of Suttas" (Suttantarājā), because no other sutta contains so many bhānvāras (one hundred and twenty six).[/p]</entry>

So it is with other requisites.  He also delights in abandoning and in bhāvanā.  A monk possessed of these four Ariyavamsā verily becomes a sage, praised by Brahmā himself (A.ii.27ff).[/p][p]This sutta was evidently a favourite topic for a sermon (AA.i.385, 386).  The Commentary explains (AA.ii.494) how, for instance, anyone who preaches on the first three Ariyavamsā (catupaccayasantosa) could bring the whole Vinaya Pitaka to bear on the discussion, while a discussion on the bhāvanārāma-ariyavamsa could include the two other Pitakas, chiefly the nekkhammapāli of the Patisambhidāmagga, the Dasuttara Sutta of the Dīgha Nikāya, the Satipatthāna Sutta of the Majjhima Nikāya, and the Niddesapariyāya of the Abhidhamma.[/p][p]The full name of the sutta seems to have been Catupaccayasantosabhāvanārāma Mahāariyavamsa Sutta (AA.i.385).

It is said that people would journey five yojanas to hear a monk preach the Ariyavamsa (E.g., AA.i.386), and mention is made of Mahāariyavamsabhānakā, who, judging from the stories of them (E.g., SA.iii.151), were extremely able and eloquent preachers.[/p]</entry>

[/p][p]The first contains a list of the devas and other beings present to worship the Buddha.  It is a long list of strange names given in verses, mostly doggerel.  Many of the beings mentioned are to us now mere names, with no special information attached.  Most of them were probably local deities, the personification of natural phenomena, guardian spirits, fairies, harpies, naiads, dryads, and many others, who are here represented as adherents of the Buddha, come to do him honour.  It is noteworthy that even the most important gods - e.g.,  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/soma,Soma')"]Soma[/a],  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/va/varuna,Varuna')"]Varuna[/a] and  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/brahmaloka,Brahmā')"]Brahmā[/a]- are only incidentally mentioned, added to the list, as it were, without special distinction.  A similar list of devas is found in the Mahavastu (i.  245; iii.68, 77); the addition of Siva to this list is significant.

He then related the story of their origin, showing that both families were descended from a common stock.  When the quarrel was thus settled, two hundred and fifty young men from each family entered the Order and the Buddha dwelt with them in Mahāvana.  But the wives of the men tried to entice them back; the Buddha, therefore, took them to Himavā, where he preached to them the  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kunaala_jat_536,Kunāla Jātaka')"]Kunāla Jātaka[/a] on the banks of the Kunāla Lake.  At the conclusion of the sermon they attained to various fruits of the Path, from anāgāmī-phala to sotāpatti.  He then returned with them to Mahāvana, where they developed insight and became arahants.  They assembled to pay homage to their teacher on the evening of the full moon day of Jetthamāsa, and to the assembly came the devas of the ten thousand world systems.  The Buddha told the monks the names of the devas present (as given in the Mahāsamaya), and, surveying the assembly, saw that it consisted of two kinds of beings, one capable of benefiting by his teaching (bhabbā), and the other not so capable (abhabbā).  The bhabbā, he saw, could be divided into six groups - the rāgacaritā and the dosa moha vitakka saddhā buddhi caritā, according to temperament.  To these, respectively, he preached six suttas, calculated to benefit each separate class, and, in order that each sutta might take the form of question and answer, he created a Buddha form to ask questions, while he himself answered them.

Asking what then is their object, he gradually leads the conversation on to the question of arahantship, along the Eightfold Path.  The Buddha then raises a quite different question, as to whether the soul and the body are identical.  The discourse on this again leads to the question of arahantship (cp.  Jāliya Sutta), but it is significant that the Buddha leaves this last question unanswered (D.i.150 8).[/p][p]Buddhaghosa explains (DA.i.316) that the Buddha raised the point of body and soul, because he knew that Mahāli harboured the heretical belief that a soul exists and that it has form.[/p][hr][p][b]2.

Sakka's throne was heated, and Sakka, assuming the form of a goose and accompanied by Sujā, visited the parrot and asked why he did not go elsewhere.  The parrot answered that he did not wish to forsake old friends, and Sakka, pleased with this answer, promised him a boon.  The parrot asked that the fig tree be made fruitful again, and this Sakka did.[/p][p]The story was told in reference to a monk who had a pleasant dwelling place near a village, but who found alms difficult to get, the villagers becoming very poor.

  <entry>[div class="huge"]Mahāsīlava Jātaka (No.  51)[/div][p]The Bodhisatta was once king of Benares under the name of Mahāsīlava.  He built six almonries and ruled in all goodness.  One of his ministers, having intrigued with a member of his harem, was expelled and took service under the king of Kosala.  He caused several bands of ruffians to invade the territory of Mahāsīlava at different times.  When they were caught and brought before Mahāsīlava, the latter gave them money and sent them away, telling them to act differently in the future.  In this way the king of Kosala was easily persuaded by his minister that Mahāsīlava's kingdom could easily be captured.  He therefore set out with an army, and as the people of Mahāsīlava were allowed to offer no resistance, the king and his ministers were captured alive and buried up to their necks in the cemetery.  In the night, when jackals approached to eat them, Mahāsīlava fastened his teeth in the neck of the jackal that came to him.  The jackal started howling and his companions fled.  In his struggles to get free, the jackal loosened the earth round Mahāsīlava, who managed to free himself and then his companions.[/p][p]In the cemetery two Yakkhas were having a dispute about a dead body, and they asked Mahāsīlava to settle it.  But he wished first to bathe, and they fetched him water and perfumes and food from the usurper's table in Benares and also his sword of state.  With this he cut the body in half, giving half to each Yakkha, and, with their aid, he entered the usurper's room where he slept.  When the latter showed signs of terror, Mahāsīlava told him of what had happened and granted him forgiveness.  His kingdom was then restored, and Mahāsīlava exhorted his subjects on the virtues of perseverance.[/p][p]The story was related to a backsliding monk.

  <entry>[div class="huge"]Mahāsanghikā, Mahāsangītikā[/div][p]One of the Buddhist schools which separated out from the Theravādins at the Second Council.  The members rejected the Parivāra, the six sections of the Abhidhamma, the Patisambhidamagga, the Niddesa and some portions of the Jātakas (KvuA.  p.  4; Dpv.v.32ff).  [/p][p]The school was so called owing to the great number of its followers, which made a great assembly or "Mahāsangitī." They were counted among the Anātmavādins, and later gave rise to the following schools: the [/p][ul][li]Mahāsanghika, [/li][li]Pubbasela, [/li][li]Aparasela, [/li][li]Rājagiriyā, [/li][li]Hemavatas, [/li][li]Cetiyavādins, [/li][li]Sankantivādins and [/li][li]Gokulikas.  [/li][/ul][p]Originally they had only two divisions the Ekabbohārikas and Gokulikas (Rockhill, op.  cit., 182ff).  [/p][p]Their separation from the orthodox school was brought about by the Vajjiputta monks, and was probably due to difference of opinion on the ten points (for these see Vin.ii.294f) held by the Vajjiputta monks.  According to Northern sources, however, the split occurred on the five points raised by Mahādeva: [/p][ul][li](1) An arahant may commit a sin under unconscious temptation; [/li][li](2) one may be an arahant and unconscious of the fact; [/li][li](3) an arahant may have doubts on matters of doctrine; [/li][li](4) one cannot attain arahantship without the help of a teacher; [/li][li](5) the "Noble Way" may begin with some such exclamation as "How sad!" uttered during meditation (J.R A.S.  1910, p.  416; cf.  MT 173).  [/li][/ul][p]These articles of faith are found in the Kathāvatthu (173ff., 187ff., 194, 197), attributed to the Pubbaselas and the Aparaselas, opponents of the Mahāsanghika school.  [/p][p]According to Hiouen Thsang (Beal.ii.164), the Mahāsanghikas divided their canon into five parts: Sūtra, Vinaya, Abhidhamma, Miscellaneous and Dhāranī.  Fa Hsien took from Pātaliputta to China a complete transcript of the Mahāsanghika Vinaya.  (Giles, p.  64, Nañjio's Catalogue mentions a Mahāsanghika Vinaya and a Mahāsanghabhiksunī Vinaya in Chinese translations, Cola.  247, 253. Ms.  No.543).

On his death, the elder came to the throne and made his brother viceroy, but, later, suspecting him of treachery, had him put in chains.  Polajanaka escaped, and, when he had completed his preparations, laid siege to the city, killed Aritthajanaka, and seized the throne.  Aritthajanaka's wife escaped in disguise, taking with her a lot of treasures.  She was pregnant, and as her child was the Bodhisatta, Sakka's throne was heated, and he appeared before her as a charioteer and took her to Kālacampā.  There she was adopted by an Udicca brahmin as his sister and the child was born.  When he played with other boys they mocked at him, calling him the widow's son.  He asked his mother what this meant, but she put him off with evasive answers until one day he bit her on the breast and insisted on being told the truth.  When he was sixteen, she gave him half the treasures, and he embarked on a ship going to  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/suvannabhuumi,Suvannabhūmi')"]Suvannabhūmi[/a] for trade.  The ship was wrecked in mid ocean, but nothing daunted, Mahājanaka (as the boy was called) swam valiantly for seven days, till  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/manimekhalaa,Manimekkhalā')"]Manimekkhalā[/a], goddess of the sea, admiring his courage, rescued him and placed him in the mango grove in Mithilā.[/p][p]Meanwhile Polajanaka had died and left orders that the throne should go to one who could find favour in the eyes of his daughter, should know which is the head of a square bed, could string the bow that required the strength of one thousand men, and could draw out the sixteen great treasures.  No one seemed forthcoming who was able to fulfil these conditions; the ministers thereupon decked the state chariot with the five insignia of royalty and sent it out, accompanied by music.  The car left the city gates, and the horses went to the mango grove and stopped at the spot where Mahājanaka lay asleep.  The chaplain, seeing the auspicious marks on his feet, awoke him, and explaining to him his mission, crowned him king.  When he entered the palace,  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/siivalii,Sīvalī')"]Sīvalī[/a] (the late king's daughter) was immediately won over by his appearance, and willingly agreed to be his queen.

One day Mahājanaka went into his park, and noticing how a mango tree, which bore fruit had been plundered by his courtiers while another which was barren was left in peace, he realized that possessions meant sorrow, and retiring into a room, lived the ascetic life.  His life span was ten thousand years, of which three thousand still remained to him.  After living for four months in the palace, he resolved to renounce the world, and having made his preparations, secretly left the palace.  The queen met him on the stairs, but did not recognise him in his ascetic garb.  On discovering his absence, she ran after him and tried by many devices to persuade him to return, but in vain.  She then urged his people to follow him, but he turned them back.  She, however, would not obey him, and for sixty leagues she and the people followed Mahājanaka.[/p][p]The sage Nārada, dwelling in Himavā, saw Mahājanaka with his divine eye and encouraged him in his resolve, as did another ascetic, Migājina, who had just risen from a trance.  Thus they journeyed on till they reached the village of Thūnā.  There the king saw a dog running away with a morsel of roasted flesh, which it dropped in its flight.  The king picked it up, cleaned it, and ate it.  The queen, very disgusted, felt that he was not worthy to be a king.  Further on they saw a girl shaking sand in a winnowing basket; on one arm she wore a single bracelet, on the other arm, two.  The two bracelets jingled, while the single one was noiseless.  Mahājanaka pointed out the moral of this to Sīvalī, and she agreed to go a different way, but soon came running back to him and followed him till they came across a fletcher, straightening an arrow, looking at it with one eye only.  On being questioned by the king, he answered that the wide horizon of two eyes served but to distract the view.  But Sīvalī still refused to leave him till, on the edge of a forest, he told her there could be no more intercourse between them, and she fell senseless.  The king rushed into the forest, while the ministers revived the queen.  When she recovered the king was no more to be seen, and she returned to the city.  Thūpas were erected on various spots connected with the king's renunciation, and the queen lived as an ascetic in the royal garden of Mithilā.[/p][p]The story was told in reference to the Buddha's Renunciation.

He alone was born of his mother's womb, the others being samsedajā.  After Padumavatī's rivals (for the earlier part of their story see  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/uppalavanna,Uppalavannā')"]Uppalavannā[/a]) had placed the children in caskets which they launched down stream, they announced to the king that Padumavatī was a non human and had given birth to a log of wood.  He expelled her from the palace, and as she wandered about in the streets, deprived of all her glory, an old woman had pity on her, took her home, and looked after her.  The king was bathing in the river when the caskets containing the children got entangled in his nets, and, having taken them out and unlocked them, he found the babes inside, together with a letter from  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sakka,Sakka')"]Sakka[/a] saying that they were the children of Padumavatī.  The king hastened back to his palace and issued a proclamation that anyone finding Padumavatī would receive one thousand as reward.  On Padumavatī's suggestion, the old woman, her protector, offered to find her, and Padumavatī then revealed herself.  She was conducted back to the palace in all glory, and her five hundred rivals were given to her as slaves.  She had them freed, and appointed them as nurses to look after her children, except Paduma (called Mahāpaduma), whom she nursed herself.  When Mahāpaduma and his brothers reached the age of sixteen, they went one day to the park, where they were impressed by the appearance of old and faded lotus among the fresh ones growing in the pond, and developing this topic of thought, they became Pacceka Buddhas and went to Nandamūla cave.  Padumavatī died of grief at the loss of all her sons and was reborn in a labourer's family.  She married, and, one day, while taking gruel to her husband, she saw eight Pacceka Buddhas (her sons in a previous birth) travelling through the air and descending near to where she stood.  She gave them the food intended for her husband and invited them for the next day.  The next day all the five hundred came to do honour to their mother and to accept her entertainment.  She fed them all and offered flowers to them (ThigA.185ff).  Afterwards Mahāpaduma and his brothers were entertained by  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/n/nanda,Nanda')"]Nanda[/a], king of Benares, and his queen (who in their last birth were  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/maha_kassapa_th,Mahā Kassapa')"]Mahā Kassapa[/a] and [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bhadda_kapilani_thi,Bhaddā Kāpilānī')"]Bhaddā Kāpilānī[/a]).[/p][p]They stayed in the royal park during the rains, and, one day, when the king was away, the queen visited them and found them dead.

In the time of Kassapa Buddha he was a monk, but was later reborn as a Treasurer of Benares, in which life he committed adultery and was reborn in hell.  Later, he became the daughter of a treasurer and was given in marriage.  But, owing to her former misdeeds, her husband did not care for her and went with another woman to the fair.  One day, however, she begged her husband to take her, and he told her to make preparations.  This she did, and on the day of the feast, hearing that her husband had already gone to the park, she followed him with her servants, taking the food and drink she had prepared.  On the way she met a Pacceka Buddha, descended from her carriage, filled his bowl with food, placing a lotus on the top, and then offered him a handful of lotus.  When her gift was accepted, she made a vow that she should be born in a lotus and be of a lotus colour, should become a man and attain the deliverance of Nibbāna.  Her body instantly became beautiful, and her husband, who suddenly remembered her, sent for her, and from then on loved her exceedingly.  After death she was born in a lotus in the deva world and was called Mahāpaduma.  [/p][p]In his next birth, at the suggestion of Sakka, he was born in a lotus in the park of the king of Benares, whose queen was childless.  She saw the lotus in the pond, and conceiving a great affection for it, picked it and found the child within as if in a casket.  She adopted the child and brought him up in great luxury.  [/p][p]One day, while playing outside the palace gates, he saw a Pacceka Buddha and warned him not to enter the palace as they pressed all who entered to eat and drink.  The Pacceka Buddha turned away, and the boy was filled with remorse at the idea that the Pacceka Buddha should be offended, and went to his lodging, riding on an elephant, to ask his forgiveness.  On the way he descended from the elephant and went on foot.  Arrived near the dwelling of the Pacceka Buddha, he dismissed his attendants and went on alone.  He found the Pacceka Buddha's cell empty, and, sitting down, developed insight and became a Pacceka Buddha.  When his attendants came for him, he declared his attainment.

Overcome by greed, they wished to cut the tree from its roots in order to get more.  Their leader, the Bodhisatta, tried to prevent this, but they refused to listen.  Then the Nāga king who lived in the tree, ordered his followers to slay all the merchants except the leader.  Him the Nāgas escorted to his home with all the treasures.[/p][p]The story was told in reference to a company of merchants from Sāvatthi, followers of the Buddha, who had a similar experience.  But having moderate desires, they made no attempt to cut down the tree.  Then they returned to Sāvatthi, and, offering some of the precious things to the Buddha, made over the merit thereof to the deity of the tree.  The Buddha praised them for their moderation.

  <entry>[div class="huge"]Mahā Kotthita (Mahā Kotthika) Thera[/div][p]One of the foremost disciples of the Buddha, ranked foremost among masters of logical analysis (patisambhidappattānam) (A.i.24; Dpv.iv.5; v.  9).  He was born into a very wealthy brahmin family of Sāvatthi, his father being Assalāyana and his mother Candavatī.[/p][p]He gained great proficiency in the Vedas and, after hearing the Buddha preach (to his father, says the Apadāna account), entered the Order and, engaging in meditation, soon became an arahant.[/p][p]He was extremely skilled in knowledge of the Patisambhidā, on which were based all his questions to the Buddha and his own colleagues.[/p][p]In the time of Padumuttara Buddha he was a rich householder, and, hearing the Buddha praise a monk as foremost among those skilled in the Patisambhidā, he wished for similar eminence for himself in the future.  To this end he visited the Buddha and his monks and entertained them for seven days, giving them three robes each at the conclusion of his almsgiving.  Owing to the skill showed by him in the Mahā Veddha Sutta (q.v.), the Buddha declared him foremost among those skilled in the Patisambhidā (Thag.vs.2; ThagA.i.29ff.; AA.i.159; Ap.ii.479; also Avadānas ii.195).[/p][p]Several instances are given of discussions between Kotthita and other eminent theras - e.g., the Nalakalāpiya Sutta on kamma (S.ii.112f), the Sīla Sutta on religious discipline (S.iii.165ff), three suttas on samudayadhamma (the nature of arising), two on assāda (satisfaction) (S.iii.172-7), two on samudaya (arising) (S.iii.173) and three on avijjā and vijjā (S.iii.17).  Another similar sutta is on sense and sense objects (S.iv.162-5), and there is a series of suttas on matters not revealed by the Buddha (avyākatāni).  S.iv.384-91; Mrs.  Rhys Davids suggests (KS.i.79i n.1) that all these suttas were compiled rather as "lessons" to be learnt than as genuine inquiries by Kotthita.  The pre eminent monks were "playing" at teacher and pupil in order to aid Kotthita to win proficiency as a teacher.  Another such "lesson" is given at A.iv.382ff., as to the motives guiding those who live the brahmacariya life.[/p][p]All these suttas took the form of discussions with Sāriputta, in which Mahā Kotthita is the questioner and Sāriputta the instructor.[/p][p]One sutta (S.iv.145 7) records a "lesson" given by the Buddha to Kotthita on conceptions of anicca, dukkha and anattā.  The Anguttara Nikāya (see the Kāyasakkhi Sutta, A.i.118f) records a discussion at Jetavana between Savittha, Kotthita and Sāriputta, as to who is best: one who has testified to the truth with body, one who has won view, or one released by faith.  Another discussion (A.ii.161f) takes place between Sāriputta and Kotthita as to whether anything continues to exist after the ending of the six spheres of contact (Nibbāna).  Once there was a dispute between Kotthita and Citta Hatthisāriputta; Citta was constantly interrupting the elder monks who were gathered at Isipatana for the discussion of the Abhidhamma, and was asked by Kotthita to abide his time and not interrupt.  Citta's friends protested that Citta was well qualified to take part in the discussion; but Kotthita declared that, far from being wise enough, Citta would, not long after, renounce the Order.  And so it happened (A.iii.392ff).[/p][p]Sāriputta evidently had a great regard for Kotthita; the Theragāthā (Thag.vss.1006 8; ThagA.ii.117) contains three stanzas in which Sāriputta proclaims his excellence.[/p]</entry>

  <entry>[div class="huge"]Mahā Kaccāna, Kaccāyana[/div][p]One of the most eminent disciples of the Buddha, considered chief among expounders in full of the brief saying of the Buddha, (sankhittena bhāsitassa vitthārena attham vibhajantānam) (A.i.23).  He was born at Ujjenī in the family of the chaplain of King Candappajjota, and was called Kaccāna both because of his golden colour and because Kaccāna was the name of his gotta.  He studied the Vedas, and, on the death of his father, succeeded him as chaplain.  With seven others he visited the Buddha, at the request of Candappajjota, to invite him to come to Ujjenī.  Kaccāna and his friends listened to the Buddha's sermon, and having attained arahantship, joined the order.  He then conveyed the king's invitation to the Buddha, who pointed out that it would now suffice if Kaccāna himself returned to Ujjenī.[/p][p]Kaccāna accordingly set out for Ujjenī with his seven companions, accepting alms on the way at the house of a very poor girl of Telappanāli, who later became Candappajjota's queen.  For details see Telappanāli.[/p][p]Arrived in Ujjenī, Kaccāna lived in the royal park, where the king showed him all honour.  He preached constantly to the people, and, attracted by his discourses, numerous persons joined the Order, so that the whole city was one blaze of orange robes.  It is said that after having duly established the sāsana in Avantī, Kaccāna returned once more to the Buddha.  (Thus, the explanation of the Madhupindika Sutta was given at Kapilavatthu).  Candappajjota consulted him on various occasions, and among the verses attributed to him in the Theragāthā (Thag.vss.494 501), are several addressed to the king himself.[/p][p]It was in the time of Padumuttara Buddha that Kaccāna had made his resolve to win the eminence he did, after listening to Padumuttara's praise of a monk, also named Kaccāna, for similar proficiency.  Kaccāna was then a vijjādhara, and offered the Buddha three kanikāra flowers.  So says the Apadāna ii.463, but ThagA.  says he was a vijjādhara in the time of Sumedhā Buddha.  In the time of Kassapa Buddha he was a householder of Benares, and offered a golden brick, worth one hundred thousand, to the cetiya which was being built over the Buddha's remains, and then made a vow that in future births his body should be golden (ThagA.i.483f.; AA.i.117f).[/p][p]According to the Apadāna (Ap.ii.465), Kaccāna's father was called Tirītivaccha (or Tidivavaccha), and his mother Candapadumā.  There is another account of Mahā Kaccāna in the Apadāna (A.i.84f), in which it is said that in the time of Padumuttara Buddha he built a yandhakuti named Paduma in the shape of a lotus and covered with lotus flowers, and that thirty kappas later he became king under the name of Pabhassara.[/p][p]Three suttas are mentioned (AA.i.118) as having obtained for Kaccāna his title of eminence - the Madhupindika, the Kaccāyana and the Parāyana; several instances are given of people seeking Mahā Kaccāna's assistance, for a detailed explanation of something said in brief by the Buddha - e.g., Hāliddikāni, Kālī, Samiddhi, Uttara and Valliya (see also A.iii.314, 321; v.  225; M.iii.223).  Among Kaccāna's pupils and followers and those who consulted him were Sonakutikanna, Isidatta, Avantiputta, Lohicca, Arāmadanda, and Kandarāyana.[/p][p]In Avanti, Kaccāna is said to have stayed, not in the king's park, where he lived soon after his return from the Buddha, but chiefly in the Kuraraghara papātā (E.g., S.iii.9; A.v.46; Ud.v.6; Vin.i.194; DhA.iv.101) and in a hut in Makkarakata forest.  S.iv.116; see also VvA.259, according to which he stayed near Potali.  [/p][p]Mention is also made of his staying at Varanā on the bank of Kaddamadaha (A.i.65); at the Gundāvana in Madhurā (A.i.67; M.ii.83); at Tapodā in Rājagaha (A.iii.192), in Soreyya (DhA.i.325; for a curious incident connected with Kaccāna's visit see Soreyya), and in Kosambī (PvA.  140).  According to Dvy.  (551, 585, 586) he also stayed in Roruka.  [/p][p]It is said (DhA.ii.176) that even when Kaccāna was living at Avanti, a long distance away, he went regularly to hear the Buddha preach, and when the chief theras took their places in the assembly, they always left room for him.  On one such occasion Sakka showed him great honour, falling at his feet, and the Buddha explained that this was because Mahā Kaccāna kept his senses well guarded.[/p][p]The Majjhima Commentary (MA.ii.854) records a curious story in reference to Kaccāna.  Vassakāra, minister of Ajātasattu, saw Kaccāna descending Gijjhakūta and said he looked like a monkey.  The Buddha read Vassakāra's thoughts, and warned him that after death he would be born as a monkey in Veluvana.  He believed the Buddha, and made provision in Veluvana for his future comfort as monkey.  And this be did indeed become, living in Veluvana and answering to the name of Vassakāra![/p][p]Kaccāna is identified with the charioteer in the Kurudhamma Jātaka (J.ii.181), and with Devala in the Sarabhanga Jātaka (J.v.151).[/p][p]According to tradition, Kaccāna was the author of the Nettippakarana, the Pāli grammar bearing his name, and of the Petakopadesa.  It is probable that these works were the compilations of a school, which traced its descent to Mahā Kaccāna.[/p][p]See also Madhura Sutta.[/p]</entry>
  <entry>[div class="huge"]Mahā-Satipatthāna Sutta [/div][p]Preached at Kammāssadamma in the Kuru country.

The day arrived when he killed the cook himself and ate his flesh.  Some time after he fell upon a brahmin traveling through the forest with a large retinue, and they gave chase to the king.  As he ran an acacia splinter pierced his foot, causing him great pain.  Seeing a banyan tree, he made a vow to bathe its trunk with the blood of one hundred and one princes if his foot were healed in seven days.  The foot did heal within that time, and with the assistance of a Yakkha, who had been his friend in a previous birth, he managed to capture one hundred kings whom he hung on the tree by means of cords passed through their hands.[/p][p]The deity of the tree was alarmed and, on the advice of  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sakka,Sakka')"]Sakka[/a], appeared before the man eater (who is called in the context Porisāda) and demanded that he should bring Sutasoma, Prince of Kuru, to complete the number of his victims.

Anxious to appease the deity, the man eater went to Sutasoma's park and there waited for him hidden in the pond, when Sutasoma came to take his ceremonial bath on the festival day of Phussa.  On the way to the park, Sutasoma met a brahmin,  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/n/nanda,Nanda')"]Nanda[/a], who offered, for four thousand pieces, to teach him four verses learnt from Kassapa Buddha.  Sutasoma promised to learn them on his return from the park, but there he was caught by the Porisāda.  Promising to return to the Porisāda, Sutasoma obtained leave to keep his appointment with Nanda.  This promise fulfilled, Sutasoma returned to the Porisāda and went with him to the banyan tree.  There he told the Porisāda of the verses he had learnt from Nanda, reciting them to him, and discoursing on the virtues of Truth.  The Porisāda was greatly pleased and offered Sutasoma four boons.  Sutasoma chose as his first boon that the Porisāda should live for one hundred years; as his second that the captive kings should be released; as his third, that their kingdoms should be restored; and as his fourth that the Porisāda should give up his cannibalism.  Only very reluctantly did the Porisāda agree to the fourth.  Sutasoma then took him back to Benares, where he restored to him his kingdom, having first assured the people that the king would never return to his former vicious habits.  Sutasoma then returned to Indapatta.  In gratitude for the tree sprite's intervention, a lake was dug near the banyan tree and a village founded near by, whose inhabitants were required to make offerings to the tree.  This village, built on the spot where the Porisāda was converted, came to be called Kammāsadamma.[/p][p]The story was related in reference to the Buddha's conversion of Angulimāla, with whom the man eater is identified.  Kālahatthi was Sāriputta, Nanda was Ananda, the tree sprite was Kassapa, Sakka was Anuruddha, and Sutasoma the Bodhisatta.  J.v.456 511; cp.  Jātakamāla xxxi.[/p][p]The Sutasomacariyā is given in the Cariyāpitaka iii.12.[/p]</entry>

<entry>[div class="huge"]2. Mahā Abhaya Thera[/div][/blockquote][hr][p][b]1. Mahā Abhaya.[/b] See Abhaya-giri.[/p][hr][p][b]1. Mahā Abhaya-Thera[/b][/p][p]Usually called Dighabhānaka Abhaya.  He was evidently an eminent Thera.  It is said (Sp.ii.474f.; referred to at DhSA.399) that when news arrived that the brigand Abhaya was coming to Cetiyagiri to pillage it, the patrons of the vihāra informed Abhaya Thera of this.  He asked them to collect various kinds of food and drink wherewith to entertain the brigand.  The latter was greatly pleased, and, on learning that this hospitality was shown him at the instigation of Abhaya Thera, he visited the Elder and took upon himself the protection of the vihāra from all danger.  Later the monks questioned the right of the Elder to entertain a robber with what belonged to the vihāra, but he convened an assembly of the monks and convinced them that he was guiltless, as his act had been solely for the protection of the belongings of the Sangha.  This story shows that the Elder lived at Cetiyagiri.[/p][p]On another occasion (MA.i.65f) Abhaya Thera preached the Mahā Ariyavamsa patipadā, and the whole village (? Mahāgāma) came to hear him.  After the sermon he received great honour.  An elderly monk was full of envy and abused him, saying that under guise of preaching he had filled the night with noise.  The two monks had to travel along the same road for the distance of a gāvuta, and all the way the old monk abused Abhaya.  When their roads separated, Abhaya worshipped the monk and took leave of him and said, when asked later, that he had heard none of the abuse because he had been all the time engaged in meditation.  One day, a certain woman who had come all the way from Ullabha kolakannikā, a distance of five leagues, to hear Abhaya preach the Ariyavamsa, found that he was about to arise without finishing the sermon, and reminded him that he was omitting the most important part.  The monk praised her and continued to preach till dawn, when the woman became a sotāpanna (AA.i.386).  It is said that once Abhaya wanted to know if a certain pindapātika monk were a putthujjana or not.  While this monk was bathing at the mouth of the Kalyānī River, Abhaya told a novice to dive into the water and catch hold of his foot.  The monk, thinking it was a crocodile, screamed with fear, and Abhaya knew that he was a puthujjana (MA.ii.869).  Thieves once bound an Elder with creepers and made him lie down.  A jungle fire spread to him, but before the creepers could be cut, he established insight and died an arahant.  Abhaya, coming along with five hundred others, saw the body, cremated it, and had a shrine built over the remains (Vsm.36).[/p][p]Abhaya's opinion was evidently greatly respected, and he is mentioned as having been consulted by Maha Dhammarakhita (VibhA.81) and Mallaka (Vsm.266) on problems connected with the Abhidhamma.[/p][p]Abhaya is mentioned among those who could remember very early incidents in their lives.  When he was only nine days old, his mother bent down to embrace him, but her hair became loose and the sumana-flowers she wore on her head fell on him, hurting him.  In later life he could remember this incident.  DA.ii.530; MNidA.234.[/p][hr][p][b]3. Mahā-Abhaya[/b].-A monk of Uddalokaka Vihāra.  Ras.ii.1.f.[/p]</entry>
  <entry>[div class="huge"]Mahā Moggallāna Thera[/div][p]The second of the Chief Disciples of the  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddha,Buddha')"]Buddha[/a].  He was born in  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kolitagaama,Kolitagāma')"]Kolitagāma[/a] near  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/r/raajagaha,Rājagaha')"]Rājagaha[/a], on the same day as  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/saariputta,Sāriputta')"]Sāriputta[/a] (they were both older than the Buddha), and was called Kolita after his village.  His mother was a brahminee called Moggalī (Moggallāni), and his father was the chief, householder of the village.  Moggallāna's and Sāriputta's families had maintained an unbroken friendship for seven generations, and so the children were friends from their childhood.  Sāriputta had five hundred golden palanquins and Moggallāna five hundred carriages drawn by thoroughbreds.  One day the two friends went together to see a mime play (giraggasamajjā), and there, realizing the impermanence of things, decided to renounce the world.  They first lived as disciples of  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sanjaya,Sañjaya')"]Sañjaya[/a], and then wandered all over  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/j/jambudiipa,Jambudīpa')"]Jambudīpa[/a], discussing with all learned men, but finding no satisfaction.  Then they separated, after agreeing that whoever first succeeded in finding what they sought should inform the other.[/p][p]After some time, Sāriputta, wandering about in Rājagaha, met  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/assaji,Assaji')"]Assaji[/a], was converted by him to the faith of the Buddha, and became a  [a href="http://www.palikanon.com/english/wtb/s_t/sotaapanna,sotāpanna')"]sotāpanna[/a].  He found Moggallāna and repeated the stanza he had heard from  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/assaji,Assaji')"]Assaji[/a] (ye dhammā hetuppabhavā, etc.), and Moggallāna also became a sotāpanna.  The two then resolved to visit the Buddha at  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/veluvana,Veluvana')"]Veluvana[/a], after an unsuccessful attempt to persuade Sañjaya to accompany them.  Sañjaya's disciples, however, five hundred in number, agreed to go, and they all arrived at Veluvana.  The Buddha preached to them, and ordained them by the "ehi bhikkhu pabbajjā." All became arahants except Sāriputta and Moggallāna.  Moggallāna went to the hamlet of Kallavāla (for details see Pacala Sutta, A.iv.85f, where the village is called Kallavālamutta) in Magadha, and there, on the seventh day after his ordination, drowsiness overcame him as he sat meditating.  The Buddha knew this, and appearing before him, exhorted him to be zealous.  That very day he attained arahantship.[/p][p]On the day that Sāriputta and Moggallāna were ordained, the Buddha announced in the assembly of monks that he had assigned to them the place of Chief Disciples and then recited the  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/patimokkha,Pātimokkha')"]Pātimokkha[/a].  The monks were offended that newcomers should be shown such great honour.  But the Buddha told them how these two had for a whole asankheyya and one hundred thousand years strenuously exerted themselves to win this great eminence under him.  They had made the first resolve in the time of  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/anomadassii,Anomadassī')"]Anomadassī[/a] Buddha.  Moggallāna had been a householder, named Sirivaddha, and Sāriputta a householder, called Sarada.  Sarada gave away his immense wealth and became an ascetic.  The Buddha visited him in his hermitage, where Sarada and his seventy four thousand pupils showed him great honour.  Anomadassī's chief disciple, Nisabha, gave thanks, and Sarada made a vow that he would become the chief disciple of some future Buddha.  Anomadassī saw that his wish would be fulfilled and told him so.[/p][p]After the Buddha's departure, Sarada went to Sirivaddka, and, announcing the Buddha's prophecy, advised Sirivaddha to wish for the place of second disciple.  Acting on this advice, Sirivaddha made elaborate preparations and entertained the Buddha and his monks for seven days.  At the end of that time, he announced his wish to the Buddha, who declared that it would be fulfilled.  From that time, the two friends, in that and subsequent births, engaged in good deeds.  AA.i.84ff.; Ap.ii.31ff.; DhA.i.73f.; SNA.i.326ff.; the story of the present is given in brief at Vin.i.39ff.[/p][p]Sāriputta and Moggallāna are declared to be the ideal disciples, whose example others should try to follow (E.g., S.ii.235; A.i.88).  In the  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/saccavibhanga_sutta,Saccavibhanga Sutta')"]Saccavibhanga Sutta[/a] (M.iii.248) the Buddha thus distinguishes these "twin brethren" from the others: "Sāriputta is as she who brings forth and Moggallāna is as the nurse of what is brought forth; Sāriputta trains in the fruits of conversion, Moggallāna trains in the highest good.  Sāriputta is able to teach and make plain the four Noble Truths; Moggallāna, on the other hand, teaches by his  [a href="http://www.palikanon.com/english/wtb/n_r/paatihariya,iddhi-pātihāriya')"]iddhi-pātihāriya[/a]." (BuA.31) Moggallāna's pre eminence lay in his possession of iddhi power (A.i.23).  He could create a living shape innumerable times and could transfer himself into any shape at will.  Thag.vs.1183; he is recorded as saying that he could crush  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/sineru,Sineru')"]Sineru[/a] like a kidney bean (DhA.iii.212), and, rolling the earth like a mat between his fingers, could make it rotate like a potter's wheel, or could place the earth on Sineru like an umbrella on its stand.  When the Buddha and his monks failed to get alms in  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/veranjaa,Verañjā')"]Verañjā[/a], Moggallāna offered to turn the earth upside down, so that the essence of the earth, which lay on the under surface, might serve as food.  He also offered to open a way from  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/n/nalerupucimanda,Nalerupu')"]Nalerupu[/a] [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/n/nalerupucimanda,-cimanda')"]-cimanda[/a]to  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/uttarakuru,Uttarakuru')"]Uttarakuru[/a], that the monks might easily go there for alms; but this offer was refused by the Buddha (Vin.iii.7; Sp.i.182f.; DhA.ii.153).  [/p][p]Several instances are given of this special display of iddhi.  Once, at the Buddha's request, with his great toe he shook the  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/me_mu/migaramatupasada,Migāramātupāsāda')"]Migāramātupāsāda[/a], and made it rattle in order to terrify some monks who sat in the ground floor of the building, talking loosely and frivolously, regardless even of the fact that the Buddha was in the upper storey.  See  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/pasadakampana,Pasādakampana Sutta')"]Pasādakampana Sutta[/a], S.v.269ff.; also the  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/utthaana_s,Utthāna Sutta')"]Utthāna Sutta[/a], SNA.i.336f.[/p][p]On another occasion, when Moggallāna visited  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sakka,Sakka')"]Sakka[/a] to find out if he had profited by the Buddha's teaching, he found him far too proud and obsessed by the thought of his own splendour.  He thereupon shook Sakka's palace, Vejayanta, till Sakka's hair stood on end with fright and his pride was humbled (See  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/cuula_tanhaasankhaya_s,Cūlatanhāsankhaya Sutta')"]Cūlatanhāsankhaya Sutta[/a], M.i.251ff).  Again, Moggallāna is mentioned as visiting the Brahma world in order to help the Buddha in quelling the arrogance of Baka Brahmā.  He himself questioned Baka in solemn conclave in the Sudhammā-Hall in the Brahma world and made him confess his conviction that his earlier views were erroneous.  Thag.vs.1198; ThagA.ii.185; S.i.144f.  ; other visits of his to the Brahma world are also recorded when he held converse with Tissa Brahmā (A.iii.331ff.; iv.75ff.; cp.  Mtu.i.54ff.).  [/p][p]In the Māratajjaniya Sutta (M.i.332ff) we are told how Māra worried Moggallāna by entering into his belly, but Moggallāna ordered him out and told him how he himself had once been a Māra named Dūsī whose sister Kālī was the mother of the present Māra.  Dūsī incited the householders against Kakusandha Buddha and was, as a result, born in purgatory.[/p][p]But, according to the Commentaries (E.g., ThagA.ii.188ff), Moggallāna's greatest exhibition of iddhi power was the subjugation of the Nāga Nandopananda.  No other monk could have survived the ordeal because no other was able to enter so rapidly into the fourth jhāna; which was the reason why the Buddha would give permission to no other monk but Moggallāna to quell the Nāga's pride.  Similar, in many ways, was his subjection of the Nāga who lived near the hermitage of Aggidatta (DhA.iii.242) (q.v.).  Moggallāna could see, without entering into any special state of mind, petas and other spirits invisible to the ordinary mortal eye (See, e.g., DhA.ii.64; iii.60, 410f., 479; S.ii.254ff.; where he saw petas while in the company of Lakkhana; cp.  Avadānas i.246ff.).  He would visit various worlds and bring back to the Buddha reports of their inhabitants (see also Mtu.i.4ff.  regarding his visit to the Nirayas), which the Buddha used in illustration of his sermons.  The Vimānavatthu (see also DhA.iii.291, re Nandiya, and iii.314) contains a collection of stories of such visits, and we are told (S.v.366f) that Moggallāna's visits to the deva worlds- e.g., that to Tāvatimsa were very welcome to the devas.[/p][p]Though Moggallāna's pre eminence was in iddhi power, yet in wisdom, too, he was second only to Sāriputta.  These two could answer questions within the range of no other disciple of the Buddha (DhA.iii.227).  The Buddha paid a compliment to Moggallāna's powers of preaching, when, having preached himself to the Sākyans in their new Mote Hall at Kapilavatthu, he asked Moggallāna, after their departure, to talk to the monks, as he himself was weary.  And Moggallāna spoke to them of lusts and of the means of getting rid of them.  At the end of the sermon the Buddha praised him warmly (S.iv.183ff).  Mention is made elsewhere (S.iv.262-9) of eloquent sermons preached by him on the jhānas, on qualities which lead to true emancipation (A.v.155ff), and of visits paid to him by Sakka in company with numerous other gods in order to hear him preach.  Other devas also went to hear him - e.g., Candana, Suyāma, Santusita, Sunimitta and Vasavatti (S.iv.  269 80).  He was also consulted by those, such as Vacchagotta (E.g., S.iv.391ff), and Vappa (A.ii.196ff), eager to learn from him the teachings of the Buddha.  When the Buddha went to preach the Abhidhamma in Tāvatimsa, it was to Moggallāna that he entrusted the task of preaching to the people who were waiting for his return.  Moggallāna, therefore, provided for these people spiritually, while Anāthapindika looked after their bodily needs (DhA.iii.219).  When the time drew near for the Buddha's return, Moggallāna, at the request of the people, went to Tāvatimsa, diving into the earth and climbing Sineru, in full view of them all, in order to find out what the Buddha intended doing, so that the people might be kept informed (DhA.224; J.iv.265; cp.  Dvy.375).  No task, which he might be told by the Buddha to perform, seemed to Moggallāna too insignificant.  Thus we find him employed by the Buddha as messenger to the arahant Uggasena, telling him that the Buddha wished to see him (Ibid., iv.62).  He was also sent to Sakkhara, to Macchariya Kosiya, to check his miserliness and bring him to Jetavana (Ibid., i.369f.; J.i.347); and to Sīlavā, whom Ajātasattu was plotting to kill (ThagA.i.536).  When Visakhā was building the Migāramātupāsāda and the Buddha was away on one of his journeys, Moggallāna, because of his iddhi power, and five hundred monks were left to supervise the work, which was carried through without difficulty (DhA.i.414f).  The Buddha placed great faith in his two chief disciples and looked to them to keep the Order pure.  There is one instance recorded of Moggallāna seizing a wicked monk, thrusting outside and bolting the door (A.iv.204ff.).  Once, when a monk charged Sāriputta with having offended him as he was about to start on a journey, Moggallāna and Ananda went from lodging to lodging to summon the monks that they might hear Sāriputta vindicate himself (Vin.ii.236; A.iv.374).  [/p][p]Their fame had reached even to the Brahma world, for we find Tudu Brahmā singing their praises, much to the annoyance of the Kokālika monk (Kokalika had a great hatred of them - e.g., A.v.170ff.; SN., p.  231ff.; SNA.ii.473ff).  When Devadatta created a schism among the monks and took five hundred of them to Gayāsīsa, the Buddha sent Sāriputta and Moggallāna to bring them back.  They were successful in this mission (DhA.i.143ff.; see also DhA.ii.109f., where they were sent to admonish the Assajipunabbasukā).  Kakudha Koliyaputta, once servant of Moggallāna and later born in a huge manomayakāya, had warned Moggallāna of Devadatta's intrigues against the Buddha, but the Buddha ignored this information carried to him by Moggallāna (Vin.ii.185; A.iii.122ff).  When Rāhula, the Buddha's son, was ordained, Sāriputta was his preceptor and Moggallāna his teacher (J.i.161; see SNA.i.304f., where the account is slightly different.  There Moggallāna is spoken of as Rāhula's kammavācāriya.).  Moggallāna seems to have carried out diligently the charge laid on him by the Buddha of looking after the monks' welfare.  Among the verses, attributed to him in the Theragāthā, are several containing exhortations to his colleagues (Thag.vss.1146-9, 1165f ); some of the colleagues are mentioned by name - e.g., Tissa, Vaddhamāna and Potthila (Ibid., 1162, 1163, 1174f).  Elsewhere (S.i.194f) mention is made of his living at Kālasilā, with a company of five hundred monks, watching over them and discovering that all were arahants.  Vangīsa witnessed this and praised Moggallāna in verse before the Buddha.[/p][p]The love existing between Moggallāna and Sāriputta was mutual, as was the admiration.  Sāriputta's verses in praise of Moggallāna (Thag.vss.1178 81) are even more eloquent than those of Moggallāna in praise of Sāriputta (Thag.vss.1176).  Their strongest bond was the love of each for the Buddha; when away from him, they would relate to each other how they had been conversing with him by means of the divine ear and the divine eye.  E.g., S.ii.275ff.; Moggallāna elsewhere also (S.ii.273f.) tells the monks of a conversation he held with the Buddha by means of these divine powers.  For another discussion between Sāriputta and Moggallāna, see A.ii.154f.  [/p][p]In the Mahāgosinga Sutta (M.i.212) we find them staying in the Gosingasālavana in the company of Mahā Kassapa, Ananda, Revata and Anuruddha, engaged in friendly discussion, referring their conclusions to the Buddha for his opinion.  Sāriputta, Moggallāna, and Anuruddha are again mentioned (S.v.174f., 299) as staying in the Ketakīvana in Sāketa.  Among discussions between Anuruddha and Moggallāna is recorded one in which Anuruddha speaks of the value of cultivating the four satipatthānas (S.v.294f).  It seems to have been usual for Sāriputta and Moggallāna, in their journeys, to travel together at the head of the monks, and lay disciples, who gave alms to the monks, were anxious to include them in their invitations.  Velukandaki in Dakkhinagiri (A.iii.336; iv.63); and Cittagahapati in Macchikāsanda (DhA.ii.74f.).[/p][p]Moggallāna died before the Buddha, Sāriputta dying before either.  The Theragāthā contains several verses attributed to Moggallāna regarding Sāriputta's death (vs.1158 61).  Sāriputta died on the full moon day of Kattika and Moggallāna two weeks later, on the new moon day (SA.iii.181).  [/p][p]According to the Commentaries (J.v.125ff) his death resulted from a plot of the Niganthas.  Moggallāna used to visit various worlds and return with his report that he had discovered that those who followed the Buddha's teaching reached happy worlds, while the followers of the heretics were reborn in woeful conditions.  These statements diminished the number of the heretics and they bribed brigands to kill Moggallāna.  They surrounded the Elder's cell in Kālasilā, but he, aware of their intentions, escaped through the keyhole.  On six successive days this happened; on the seventh, they caught him and beat him, crushing his bones and leaving him for dead.  Having recovered consciousness, with a great effort of will, he dragged himself to the Buddha in order to take his leave, and there he died, to the sorrow of the deva worlds.  This sad death is said to have been the result of a sin committed by him in a previous birth.  Acting on the instigation of his wife, he had taken his blind parents into a forest, where, pretending that they were attacked by thieves, he had beaten them to death.  For this deed he suffered in hell for innumerable years, and in his last birth lost his life by violence.[/p][p]The account in DhA.iii.65ff.  differs in several details.  The thieves tried for two months before succeeding in their plot and, in the story of the past, when the blind parents were being beaten, they cried out to the supposed thieves to spare their son.  Moggallāna, very touched by this, did not kill them.  Before passing into Nibbāna, he preached to the Buddha, at his request, and performed many miracles, returning to Kālasilā to die.  According to the Jātaka account his cremation was performed with much honour, and the Buddha had the relics collected and a Thūpa erected in Veluvana.[/p][p]Moggallāna's body was of the colour of the blue lotus or the rain cloud (Bu.i.58).  There exists in Ceylon an oral tradition that this colour is due to his having suffered in hell in the recent past![/p][p]Moggallāna is connected with characters in several Jātakas: thus, he was [/p][ul][li]Kisavaccha in the Indriya Jātaka (J.iii.469), [/li][li]Sakka in the Illīsa (i.  354), [/li][li]one of the devas in the Kakkāru (iii.90), [/li][li]the tortoise in the Kurungamiga (ii.155), [/li][li]Candasena in the Khandahāla (vi.  157), [/li][li]the senāpati in the Cullasutasoma (v.  192), [/li][li]the youngest bird in the Javanahamsa (iv.  218), [/li][li]the elephant in the Tittira (i.  220), [/li][li]the tiger in the Tittira (iii.543), [/li][li]Ayura in the Dasannaka (iii.341), [/li][li]the jackal in the Pañcūposatha (iv.  332), [/li][li]Suriya in the Bilārikosiya (iv.  69), [/li][li]one of the brothers in the Bhisa (iv.  314), [/li][li]Subhaga in the Bhūridatta (vi.  219), [/li][li]the old tortoise in the Mahāukkusa (iv.  297), [/li][li]Migājina in the Mahājanaka (vi.  68), [/li][li]Bījaka in the Mahānāradakassapa (vi.  255), [/li][li]the king's charioteer in the Rājovāda (ii.5), [/li][li]the tiger in the Vannāroha (iii.193), [/li][li]the Garula king in the Vidhurapandita (vi.  329), [/li][li]the tiger in the Vyaggha (ii.358), [/li][li]the rat in the Saccankara (i.  32), [/li][li]Bhadrakāra in the Sambhava (v.  67), [/li][li]Kisavaccha in the Sambhanga (v.  151), [/li][li]the jackal in the Sasa (iii.56), [/li][li]Canda in the Sudhābhojana (v.  412), and [/li][li]Gopāla in the Hatthipāla (iv.  491).[/li][/ul]</entry>

Then the king's only child, his beloved daughter Rujā, comes to him arrayed in splendour, attended by her maidens, and asks for one thousand to be given the next day to mendicants.  Angati protests; he will deny his daughter no pleasure or luxury, but has learnt too much to approve of her squandering money on charity or wasting her energy in keeping the fasts.[/p][p]Rujā is at first amazed, then tells her father that his councillors are fools, they have not taken reckoning of the whole of their past, but remember only one birth or two; they cannot therefore judge.  She herself remembers several births; in one she was a smith in Rājagaha and committed adultery, but that sin remained hidden, like fire covered with ashes, and she was born as a rich merchant's only son in Kosambī.  There she engaged in good works, but, because of previous deeds, she was born after death in the Roruva-niraya and then as a castrated goat in Bhennākata.  In her next birth she was a monkey, and then an ox among the Dasannas; then a hermaphrodite among the Vajjians, and later a nymph in Tāvatimsa.  Once more her good deeds have come round, and hereafter she will be born only among gods and men.  Seven births hence she will be a male god in Tāvatimsa, and even now the god Java is gathering a garland for her.[/p][p]All night she preaches in this way to her father, but he remains unconvinced.  The Bodhisatta is a Brahmā, named Nārada Kassapa, and, surveying the world, sees Rujā and Angati engaged in conversation.  He therefore appears in the guise of an ascetic, and Angati goes out to greet and consult him.  The ascetic praises goodness, charity, and generosity, and speaks of other worlds.  Angati laughs, and asks for a loan which, he says, he will repay twice over in the next world, as the ascetic seems so convinced that there is one.  Nārada tells him of the horrors of the hell in which Angati will be reborn unless he mends his ways, and mentions to him the names of former kings who attained to happiness through good lives.  The king at last sees his error and determines to choose new friends.  Nārada Kassapa reveals his identity and leaves in all majesty.[/p][p]The story was related in reference to the conversion of  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/uruvela_kassapa,Uruvela Kassapa')"]Uruvela Kassapa[/a].  He came, after his conversion, with the Buddha to Latthivana, and the people wondered if he had really become a follower of the Buddha.  He dispelled their doubts by describing the folly of the sacrifices which he had earlier practised, and, laying his head on the Buddha's feet did obeisance.  Then he rose seven times into the air, and, after having worshipped the Buddha, sat on one side.  The people marvelled at the Buddha's powers of conversion, which, the Buddha said, were not surprising since he possessed them already as a Bodhisatta.[/p][p]Angati is identified with Uruvela Kassapa, Alāta with Devadatta, Sunāma with Bhaddiya, Vijaya with Sāriputta, Bījaka with Moggallāna, Guna with the Licchavi Sunakkhatta, and Rujā with Ananda.

He divided them into eight parts, one of which he gave to each king.

He saw the Buddha's footprints and, following them, he came upon the Buddha seated at the foot of a-tree.  Dona asked him various questions as to his identity and the Buddha explained to him his Buddha-hood (A.ii.37f).  The Commentary (AA.ii.505f) states that Dona was a teacher with a large following, and that the Buddha's journey to Setavyā was undertaken for the purpose of meeting him.  At the end of the Buddha's discourse, Dona became an anāgāmī and composed a poem of twelve thousand words in praise of the Buddha.  This poem became known as the Donagajjita.  Dona was held in very high esteem as a teacher, and it is said (DA.ii.607f) that, at some time or other practically all the chiefs of Jambudīpa had sat at his feet.  Therefore he was able to dissuade them from quarrelling over the Buddha's relics.  On that occasion he stood on a hill and recited the Donagajjita.

  <entry>[div class="huge"]Devā (Sutta)[/div][hr][p][b]1. Devā[/b].-A class of beings.  As a title the word Deva is attributed to any being regarded, in certain respects, as being above the human level.  Thus it is used for a king.  In a late classification (CNid.307; KhA.123, etc.) there are three kinds of Devil: sammutidevā (conventional gods - e.g., kings and princes); visuddhidevā (beings who are divine by the purity of their great religious merit - arahants and Buddhas); and uppattidevā (beings who are born divine).  Under the third category various groups are enumerated, the commonest number being seven: Cātummahārājikā, Tāvatimsā, Yāmā, Tusitā, Nimmānaratī, Paranimmitavasavattī and Brahmakāyikā (E.g., D.i.216; A.i.210, etc.).  The longest list is that of the Majjhima Nikāya (i.289; iii.100. The Divyāvadāna p.266 contains a list of twenty-two), which contains the names of twenty-five groups.  The popular etymology of the word connects it with the root div in the sense of playing, sporting, or amusing oneself, sometimes also of shining: dibbantī ti devā, pañcahi kāmagunehi kīlanti, attano vā siriyā jotantī ti attho (KhA.123).  The word implies possession of splendour and power of moving at will, beauty, goodness and effulgence of body, and, as such, is opposed to the dark powers of mischief and destruction - such as the Asuras, Petas and Nerayikas.  The Devas are generally regarded as sharing kinship and continuity of life with humans; all Devas have been men and may again be born among men.  They take interest in the doings of men, especially the Cātummahārājikā and the gods of Tāvatimsa.  They come to earth to worship the Buddha and to show reverence to good men.  Sakka (q.v.) is usually spoken of as chief of the gods - devānam indo.  All Devas are themselves in samsāra, needing salvation.  They are subject to death, their life-spans varying according to the merit of each individual deva.  They are born in the full flower of youth and are free from illness till the moment of their death.  Devas die from one of the following causes: exhaustion of life, merit or food; failing, through forgetfulness, to eat; and jealousy at the glory of another, which leads to anger.  (DhA.l.173. For other particulars regarding devas see the article in the NPD).  When a deva is about to die five signs appear on him: his clothes get soiled, flowers worn by him fade, sweat exudes from his armpits, his body loses its colour and he becomes restless on his seat.

  <entry>[div class="huge"]Devadatta[/div][p]Son of the Sākiyan Suppabuddha (maternal uncle of the Buddha) and his wife Amitā.  He had a sister Bhaddakaccānā, who married Prince Siddhattha.  [/p][blockquote][p]Mhv.ii.22; MT.136; DhA.iii.44. The Dulva (Rockhill, p.13) calls him the son of Amitodana and brother of Ananda.  This is supported by Mtu.  (ii.69), which says that after the Buddha's renunciation, Devadatta tried to tempt Bhaddakaccānā.  In one passage in the Vinaya (ii.189), Devadatta is spoken of as Godhiputta.  Does this mean that his mother's name was Godhī? The Sanskrit books (e.g., Mtu) give several stories of his youth which show his malice.  When Siddhattha was about to show his skill in the arts, a white elephant was being brought for him, and Devadatta, out of envy, killed it.  The carcase blocked the city gates till Siddhattha threw it outside.  The Pāli Commentaries (e.g., SA.i.62) say that Devadatta had the strength of five elephants.  On another occasion he quarrelled with Siddhattha, who protested against his shooting a goose.[/p][/blockquote][p]When the Buddha visited Kapilavatthu after the Enlightenment and preached to the Sākiyans, Devadatta was converted together with his friends Ananda, Bhagu, Kimbila, Bhaddiya, Anuruddha, and their barber, Upāli, and he sought the Buddha at Anupiyā and entered the Order (Vin.ii.182).  During the rainy season that followed, Devadatta acquired the power of iddhi possible to those who are yet of the world (puthujja-nika-iddhi) (Vin.ii.183; for particulars see Rockhill, p.85).  For some time he seems to have enjoyed great honour in the Order, and in one passage he is mentioned in a list of eleven of the chief Elders of all of whom the Buddha speaks in praise.  (Ud.i.5. Again in Vin.ii.189 Sāriputta is mentioned as having gone about Rājagaha singing Devadatta's praises; see also DhA.i.64f).  Devadatta was later suspected of evil wishes (E.g., S.ii.156).  About eight years before the Buddha's death, Devadatta, eager for gain and favour and jealous of the Buddha's fame, attempted to win over Ajātasattu.  [/p][p][/p][p]The following account is summarised from various passages in the books, chiefly Vin.ii.184ff; iii.171f; 174f; iv.71; DhA.i.112ff; iii.154; A.iii.123, 402; ii.73; iv.160; J.i.113, 142, 185, 490; iv.37, 158; v.333ff; vi.129f., etc.[/p][p][/p][p]He assumed the form of a child having a girdle of snakes, and suddenly appeared on Ajātasattu's lap, frightening him.  He then resumed his own form, and Ajātasattu, much impressed, paid him great honour and, it is said, visited him morning and evening with five hundred chariots and sent him daily five hundred dishes of food.  (According to J.i.186, 508, Ajātasattu built for him a monastery at Gayāsīsa and sent him, daily, five hundred pots of three-year-flavoured rice and the choicest dishes.  These meals were so tempting that some of the Buddha's followers would go there to eat them and return stealthily).  [/p][p]This encouraged Devadatta in his schemes, and he conceived the idea of taking the Buddha's place as leader of the Sangha.  As soon as this thought occurred to him, his iddhi-power disappeared.[/p][p][/p][p]The Koliyan Kakudha, follower of Moggallāna, reborn as a manomaya-kāyikadeva, divined Devadatta's plan and informed Moggallāna.  The latter repeated the matter to the Buddha, but the Buddha said it was unnecessary to discuss it as Devadatta would ultimately betray himself.[/p][p][/p][p]Sometime later, Devadatta went to the Buddha and suggested that the leadership of the Order should be handed over to him in view of the Buddha's approaching old age.  The Buddha scorned the suggestion, saying, "Not even to Sāriputta or Moggallāna would I hand over the Order, and would I then to thee, vile one, to be vomited like spittle?" (Vin.ii.188. This incident is referred to in the Abhayarājakumāra Sutta, M.i.393).  Devadatta showed great resentment and vowed vengeance.  Thereupon, at the Buddha's suggestion, a proclamation was issued to the Sangha that in anything done by Devadatta in the name of the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha, none but Devadatta was to be recognised.[/p][p]It was at this time that Devadatta incited Ajātasattu to kill his father, Bimbisāra, while he himself prepared to kill the Buddha.  (The Ap.ii.300f explains that all these plans of Devadatta to harm the Buddha were the result of the Buddha's previous evil deeds).[/p][p]Ajātasattu agreed, and provided Devadatta with royal archers to shoot the Buddha.  These were placed on different paths, one on one path, two on another, and so on up to sixteen, and the plan was so laid that not one of them would survive to tell the tale.  But when the Buddha approached the first man, he was terrified by the Buddha's majesty, and his body became stiff.  The Buddha spoke kindly to him, and the man, throwing away his weapons, confessed his intended crime.  The Buddha thereupon preached to him and, having converted him, sent him back by a different path.  The other groups of archers, tired of waiting, gave up the vigil and went away one after the other.  The different groups were led to the Buddha by his iddhi-power, and he preached to them and converted them.  The first man returned to Devadatta saying that he was unable to kill the Buddha because of his great iddhi-power.[/p][p]Devadatta then decided to kill the Buddha himself.  One day, when the Buddha was walking on the slopes of Gijjhakūta, he hurled down on him a great rock.  Two peaks sprang up from the ground, thereby arresting its rushing advance, but a splinter struck the Buddha's foot, causing the blood to flow.  Being in great pain, he was carried to Maddakucchi, and from there to Jīvaka's Ambavana, where Jīvaka attended him.  After this event, the monks wished the Buddha to have a guard, but this he refused, saying that it was impossible for anyone to deprive a Tathāgata of his life.[/p][p][/p][p]Devadatta's next attempt on the Buddha's life was to persuade elephant-keepers to let loose a fierce elephant, Nalāgiri (or Dhanapāla), drunk with toddy, on to the road by which the Buddha would pass.  The news spread rapidly, and the Buddha was warned, but refused to turn back.  As the elephant advanced he pervaded it with love, and thus completely subdued it.[/p][p]This outrage made Devadatta very unpopular, and even Ajātasattu was compelled by the force of public opinion to withdraw his patronage from Devadatta, whose gain and honour decreased.  (Sp.iv.811. At this time, Kokālika was very useful to Devadatta, J.  ii.438).  Thereupon he decided, with the help of several others, Kokālika, Katamoraka-tissa, Khandadeviyāputta and Samuddadatta, to bring about a schism in the Order.  These five went accordingly to the Buddha and asked for the imposition of five rules on all members of the Sangha: [/p][ul][li][p](1) that monks should dwell all their lives in the forest, [/li][li][p](2) that they should accept no invitations to meals, but live entirely on alms obtained by begging, [/li][li][p](3) that they should wear only robes made of discarded rags and accept no robes from the laity, [/li][li][p](4) that they should dwell at the foot of a tree and not under a roof, [/li][li][p](5) that they should abstain completely from fish and flesh.  [/li][/ul][p]The Buddha's reply was that those who felt so inclined could follow these rules - except that of sleeping under a tree during the rainy season - but he refused to make the rules obligatory.  This refusal delighted Devadatta, who went about with his party, declaring that the Buddha was prone to luxury and abundance.  He was believed by the foolish, and in spite of the Buddha's warning against the dire sin of causing schism in the Order, Devadatta informed Amanda of his intention of holding an uposatha meeting without the Buddha, and, having persuaded five hundred newly ordained monks from Vesāli to join him, he went out to Gayāsīsa.  On this occasion he tried to imitate the Buddha, keeping two chief disciples beside him (DhA.i.122).  Three suttas, the two Devadatta, and the Mahāsāropama, were preached after this event.[/p][p][/p][p]Among the followers of Devadatta were also some nuns, chief of whom was Thullanandā, who never tired of singing his praises (Vin.iv.66, 335).  The mother of Kumārakassapa (q.v.), also, first entered the Order under Devadatta, but when he denounced her, following the discovery of her pregnancy, she sought refuge with the Buddha.  Some of the Sākiyans, too, seem to have preferred Devadatta to the Buddha - e.g., Dandapāni (MA.i.298).  [/p][p][/p][p]The Buddha sent Sāriputta and Moggallāna to Gayāsīsa to bring back the deluded ones.  Devadatta, believing that they had come to join him, rejoiced, and, in spite of Kokālika's warning, welcomed them.  That night he preached very late to the monks, and, wishing for rest, asked Sāriputta to address the assembly.  Sāriputta and Moggallāna preached to such effect that they persuaded the five hundred monks to return with them.  Kokālika kicked Devadatta on the chest to awaken him and tell him the news.  When Devadatta discovered what had happened, hot blood came from his mouth, and for nine months he lay grievously ill.  (The Vinaya account omits the kicking, but it is mentioned in DhA.i.143 and in J.i.491).  [/p][p][/p][p]As his end drew near, he wished to see the Buddha, though the latter had declared that it would not be possible in this life.  Devadatta, however, started the journey on a litter, but on reaching Jetavana, he stopped the litter on the banks of the pond and stepped out to wash.  The earth opened and he was swallowed up in Avīci, where, after suffering for one hundred thousand kappas, he would be reborn as a Pacceka Buddha called Atthissara.  (The Saddharmapundarika (chap.xi.) says he will be a Buddha named Devarāja).  It is said (DhA.i.147; see also Mil.108) that at the moment of being swallowed by the earth, Devadatta uttered a stanza in which he declared that he had no refuge other than the Buddha.  It is this last act of Devadatta's which the Buddha had in view when he agreed to ordain Devadatta.  (He was one of five people who were swallowed by the earth in the Buddha's time.  Mil.101).  [/p][p][/p][p]The Dhammapada Commentary contains a graphic account of the tortures of Devadatta in Avīci.  (DhA.i.147; also PSA.79. His body in bell is one hundred leagues long).  In previous births, also, he had been swallowed by the earth, as King Kalābu and as Mahāpatāpa.  When the people heard of Devadatta's death, they held a great festival, as they had done of yore at the death of Pingala, who was an incarnation of Devadatta (DhA.i.126f).[/p][p][/p][p]The Jātaka Commentary contains numerous stories showing that Devadatta's enmity towards the Buddha was not confined to this life.  It had existed during many kappas, and though sometimes he was foiled in his attempts to harm the Bodhisatta, in many cases he succeeded in working his will.  The beginning of this enmity, which increased with time, is described in the  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/serivanija_jat_003,Serivānija Jātaka')"]Serivānija Jātaka[/a].[/p][p][/p][p]One of the Milinda dilemmas (200ff) is as follows: "Why should Devadatta, who was so wicked, have been, time after time, superior in power to the Bodhisatta?"

The king was horrified and fearing that she would harm his elder children, sent them into the forest for twelve years, asking them to return after his death.  In the forest Rāma lived the ascetic life while Lakkhana and Sītā provided him with food.  Dasaratha died after nine years, and when the ministers refused to recognise Bharata as king, he went into the forest in search of Rāma.  Rāma, however, refused to return until three more years had elapsed, and on Bharata refusing to occupy the throne, Rāma gave him his straw slippers to be placed on the throne in his absence.  When cases were heard, if the decision given was wrong, the slippers would beat upon each other, but, if right, they would lie quiet.

According to Tibetan sources (Rockhill, pp.185, 192), they were called after their leader, Dharmagupta.  Their fundamental doctrines were these: that the Buddha is not comprised in the Sangha; that while there is great reward for offerings made to the Buddha, there is none for offerings to the Sangha; that a life of brahmacariya exists also among the devas; and that there are worldly laws as opposed to spiritual.[/p][p][/p][p]2.

The king became a heretic.  The Bodhisatta who was born as Sakka, seeing all this, came to Benares with an old Pacceka Buddha and stood close to the palace, showing him great reverence.  When the king came out Sakka revealed his identity, telling him that even the ruler of the gods honoured pious men.

Another ascetic, Nārada (the Bodhisatta), arrived later at the hut and, with the permission of Devala, stayed there.  During the night, Nārada, going out of the hut, trod on the locks of Devala who lay right across the doorway.  He asked for pardon, and returning, passed by what he took to be Devala's feet, but Devala had turned round and Nārada again trod on his hair.  Devala thereupon cursed him, saying that, at sunrise, his head would split in seven pieces; but Nārada stopped the sun from rising.  The king enquired as to what had happened, and, on learning the story, forced Devala to ask Nārada's pardon.  As he did not do this of his own free will, he was taken, at Nārada's suggestion, to a pond and made to stand up to his neck in water with a lump of clay on his head.

  <entry>[div class="huge"]Dakkhināpatha (Dakkhināpatha)[/div][p]In the old Pāli literature the name Dakkhināpatha would seem to indicate only a remote settlement or colony on the banks of the upper Godāvarī.  Thus, we are told that Bāvarī had his hermitage in Dakkhināpatha territory, midway between the kingdoms of Assaka and Alaka (SN., vs.976).  Elsewhere the name is coupled with Avanti as Avantidakkhināpatha and seems to refer, but more vaguely, to the same limited district.  Vin.i.195, 196; ii.298. In J.v.133, however, Avanti is spoken of as a part of Dakkhināpatha (Dakkhinūpathe Avantirattha), but see J.iii.463, where Avantidakkhināpatha is spoken of.[/p][p]The Sutta Nipāta Commentary (ii.580) seems to explain Dakkhināpatha as the road leading to the [b]Dakkhinajanapada[/b], while the Sumangala-Vilāsinī (DA.i.265) takes Dakkhināpatha to be synonymous with Dakkhinajanapada and says that it was the district (janapada) south of the Ganges (Gangāya dakkhinato pākatajanapadam).[/p][p]It is clear that, in the earlier literature at any rate, the word did not mean the whole country comprised in the modern word Dekkhan.  It is possible that Dakkhināpatha was originally the name of the road which led southwards - the Aryan settlement at the end of the road, on the banks of the Godāvarī being also called by the same name - and that later the road lent its name to the whole region through which it passed.  (For a detailed description see Law: Geog.  of Early Buddhism, pp.60ff).  In the Petavatthu Commentary (PvA., p.133) the Damila country (Damilavisaya) is included in the Dakkhināpatha.  [/p][p]The Dakkhināpatha is famous in literature as the birthplace of strong bullocks (DhSA.141; NidA.16; DhA.iii.248, etc.).  It held also a large number of ascetics (DA.i.265), and in the "southern districts" (Dakkhinesu janapadesu) people celebrated a feast called Dharana (A.v.216).  See Dharana Sutta.[/p]</entry>

Some courtiers, overhearing the conversation, reported it to Pasenadi, who, profiting by it, re-entered the battle and captured Ajātasattu alive.  When the matter was reported to the Buddha, he related the Vaddhaki-sūkara Jātaka (q.v.) to show that in the past, too, Tissa had been skilled in the art of warfare (J.ii.403f).

In the district was the brahmin village of Ekanālā (SN., p.13).  The road from Sāvatthi to Rājagaha lay through Dakkhināgiri, and the Buddha traversed it in the course of his periodical tours through Magadha, residing in the Dakkhināgiri-vihāra in Ekanālā (S.i.172; SA.ii.133; Vin.i.80).  It was during one of these tours that he converted Kasī-Bhāradvāja and Dhammasava (q.v.) and his father.  On another of these occasions the Buddha saw the Magadhakhetta, which gave him the idea of designing the robe of a monk to resemble a field (Vin.i.287).  Ananda is also said to have travelled through Dakkhināgiri, gathering a large number of young men into the Order, who, however, do not appear to have been very serious in their intentions, as their behaviour earned for Ananda the censure of Mahā Kassapa (S.ii.217f).  Later, we find Punna with a large following in Dakkhināgiri refusing to join in the findings of the Rājagaha Council, and preferring to follow the Dhamma according to his own lights (Vin.ii.289).[/p][p]Dakkhināgiri was the residence of Nandamātā of Velukantaka and she was visited both by Sāriputta and by Moggallāna during a tour in the district (A.iv.64).

There may have been two buildings of the same name.  See Cv.Trs.i.126, n.1.[/p]</entry>
  <entry>[div class="huge"]Dāthāsena[/div][p]A warrior.  In the time of Kassapa Buddha he gave milk-rice to monks for 20,000 years.  Later he was born in Kubukandha and joined Dutthagāmani, taking a prominent part in the capture of Mahela-nagara.  Then the king's mind was poisoned against him and an elephant was let loose on him.  But he killed it and went to Mahājallika, where he defeated a fisherman of immense strength, then swam across to Cola and was ordained by Mahāvaruna Thera.[/p][p]He lived for a time in Therambalaka Vihāra, sixty leagues away; but finding it unsuitable, he moved to Lohakūtapabbata-vihāra, fifteen leagues away, and there attained arahantship.

  <entry>[div class="huge"]Dhammasavaniya[/div][p]A thera who attained arahantship at the age of seven, having heard the Buddha preach the stanza beginning with "aniccā vata sankhārā." [/p][p][/p][p]In the time of Padumuttara Buddha he was a Jatila who, while flying through the air, was forced to descend where the Buddha sat preaching, it being impossible to fly over him.  He was afterwards born in Tāvatimsa.  Ap.i.273f.[/p]</entry>
  <entry>[div class="huge"]Donapāka Sutta[/div][p]Once Pasenadi, uncomfortable and short of breath after a heavy meal, visited the Buddha.  The Buddha admonished him on the evils of gluttony and taught the young Sudassana, who came with Pasenadi, a verse to be repeated whenever food was placed before the king.  The king paid the young man one hundred kahāpanas daily for this service.  Pasenadi profited by the lesson and became healthy.  S.i.81; DhA.iii.264f gives a fuller version of this story.  There Sudassana is described as the king's nephew.  This is also probably the incident mentioned at DhA.iv.15f; but the youth there is called Uttara.[/p]</entry>
  <entry>[div class="huge"]Dadhivāhana Jātaka (No.186)[/div][p]Once four brothers of Kāsi became ascetics in the Himālayas.  The eldest died and was born as Sakka; he visited the others, and gave them, respectively, a magic razor-axe, which could be used as razor or axe; a drum, one side of which drove away elephants, while the other made friends of them; and a bowl from which a stream of curd flowed at its possessor's will.  In a beautiful island far away lived a wild boar who owned a gem which enabled its possessor to travel through the air.  A shipwrecked sailor from Kāsi stole this while the boar slept, and, with it, travelled to the Himālaya.  There he saw the ascetics, and, in exchange for the gem, obtained from them their magic possessions, afterwards returning and killing them, so that he regained the gem.  He then went to  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/baranasi,Benares')"]Benares[/a] and took possession of the throne, becoming known as King Dadhivāhana, because he destroyed his enemies by drowning them in a river of curds.  In his garden grew a mango tree, sprung from a mango which had floated down from Lake Kannamunda.  He sent fruits from this tree as presents to the neighbouring kings, but always pricked the mango stone with a thorn so that it should not bear fruit.  Once, an offended king sent to Dadhivāhana a gardener whom he had bribed to destroy the flavour of the mangoes.  The king gave him employment, but the gardener, by growing bitter creepers round the mango tree, destroyed the flavour of the fruit.  The Bodhisatta, who was the king's councillor, discovered the plot and had the creepers uprooted.[/p][p]The story was related to illustrate the effects of evil association (J.ii.101-6).[/p]</entry>

  <entry>[div class="huge"]Dubbaca Jātaka (No.116)[/div][p]The Bodhisatta was once a very skilled acrobat and travelled about with his teacher who knew the dance of the four javelins.  One day the teacher, in a drunken fit of boasting, announced that he would do the dance of the five javelins - which he did not know - and insisted on doing it against the advice of the Bodhisatta.  The result was that the boaster was impaled on the fifth javelin (J.i.430f).  For the introductory story see the Gijjha Jātaka (No.42).[/p]</entry>

  <entry>[div class="huge"]Dhammadinna [/div][hr][p]1. Dhammadinna Thera.-Also called Mahādhammadinna.  An arahant.  He resided at Talanga-(Talangatissa-pabbata) (q.v.).  He was one of the monks who partook of the meal of sour gruel given by Dutthagāmanī when in dire distress for want of food.  Dhammadinna distributed his share among ten thousand monks in Piyangudīpa (Mhv.xxxii.52).  He is also mentioned (MT.606) as having accepted a meal given by Sāliya and his wife when they were blacksmiths in a previous birth.  Dhammadinna had a nephew who became an arahant in the tonsure-hall.  Dhammadinna read to him the three Pitakas, and he learnt them all on that occasion (VibhA.389).  Dhammadinna's teacher was Mahānāga of Uccatalanka (v.l.  Uccavālika).  Dhammadinna visited him in his old age, knowing that, though he himself thought he had attained arahantship, this was not the case.  By a display of iddhi-power, Dhammadinna convinced Mahānāga of his error and gave him a subject of meditation.  Almost immediately after, the Elder became an arahant (VibhA.489; Vsm.634f).  Once, while preaching the Apannaka Sutta, at Tissamahārāma, Dhammadinna pointed his fan downwards, whereupon the earth opened to the depth of Avīci, revealing all that was there.  Similarly, he showed all things to the height of the Brahma-world.  During his sermon he frightened the audience with the fear of hell and lured them with the bliss of heaven (Vsm.392).[/p][p]The Majjhima Commentary records that soon after the ordination of Dhammadinna many monks, on his advice, became arahants.  (MA.i.149ff.  A variation of what is evidently the same story is found in AA.i.25).  Hearing of this, the monks of Tissamahārāma sent a number of their colleagues to fetch him.  He preached to them, and they attained arahantship and remained with him.  Three times this happened.  On the fourth occasion an aged monk was sent.  He gave the message of the monks and Dhammadinna started at once to go to them.  On the way, at Hankana (v.l.  Tangana) and at Cittalapabbata, he persuaded two monks, who thought they were arahants, to display their iddhi-power, and, thereby convinced them of their error; thereupon he gave them topics of meditation.  On his arrival at Tissamahārāma, the monks failed to pay him their respects.  He thereupon made the earth tremble and returned to his own vihāra.  The Saddhammasangaha (p.88f) relates the story of a blind rat-snake who heard Dhammadinna recite the satipatthānas and was later born as Tissāmacca, minister of Dutthagāmani.[/p][hr][p][/p][p]2. Dhammadinna.-An eminent lay-follower of the Buddha.  He once came with five hundred upāsakas to the Buddha at Isipatana and asked him to give them a lesson which might profit them, for, said he, it is difficult for a householder encumbered with a family and the luxuries of household life to comprehend the Buddha's teachings in their fullness.  The Buddha answers that they should practise the four limbs of sotāpatti: loyalty to the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha, and the cultivation of Āriyan virtues.  Dhammadinna answers that they already possess these limbs.  The Buddha then expresses his great satisfaction (S.v.406ff).[/p][p]The Commentary (SA.iii.223) says that Dhammadinna was one of seven laymen with followings of five hundred - the others being Visākha, Ugga, Citta, Hatthaka Ālavaka and Cūla- and Mahā-Anāthapindika.[/p][hr][p][/p][p]3. Dhammadinna.  A monk of Tissamahā-vihāra near Talañgarapabbata.  Once, while on pilgrimage to Nāgadīpa with 500 others, he stopped at Sāgiri Vihāra, and they were looked after by Bahulamassutissa Thera.  The next day they went for alms to Punnsālakotthaka, where a resident entertained them to a meal with hare's flesh.  Dhammadinna later asked why Tissa Thera did not admonish his follower on the evils of killing, seeing that there was a heap of bones outside the house.  Tissa asked Dhammadinna to do so the next day.  This was done; the devotee confessed that he had never killed a hare, but in his house there was never any want of hare's flesh, and he did not know why.  Dhammadinna, with his divine eye, revealed to him that in the time of Padumuttara Buddha he had given alms with hare's flesh.  Ras.ii.128f.[/p]</entry>
