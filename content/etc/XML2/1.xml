  <entry>[div class="huge"]Pūtimamsa Jātaka (No.  437)[/div][p]Once, on the slopes of the Himālaya, lived a jackal called Pūtimamsa with his mate Venī.  Near by dwelt a flock of wild goats.  Pūtimamsa formed a device for killing the goats one by one and eating their flesh, till only a she goat, called Melamātā, was left.  Wishing to devour her as well, Pūtimamsa suggested to Venī that he should pretend to be dead and that Venī should then entice Melamātā into the cave by asking her to assist in the funeral rites.  But the goat was wise and observant and discovered the ruse.  Venī went to her later and saying that Pūtimamsa had recovered consciousness at the very sight of her, invited her to join them in a feast to celebrate his recovery.  Melamātā, agreed, saying that she would bring with her a large escort of her friends, fierce dogs, including Maliya, Pingiya, Caturakkha and Jambuka, in order that the celebration might be a great one.  At this suggestion Pūtimamsa and Venī fled from their cave, taking rescue elsewhere.[/p][p]The story was told to the monks in order to impress on them the necessity for keeping guard over their senses.

Pulacceri[/h4][p]A landing place in Ceylon where Māgha and Jayabāhu set up fortifications.  Cv.lxxxiii.17.[/p][p]Pulatthi nagara( pura).  A capital of the Singhalese kings.  It is first heard of in the reign of Aggabodhi III., who built in the town the Mahāpānadīpa vihāra (Cv.xliv.122).  But it was probably an important centre even earlier, and Vijitapura, wrested from the Tamils by Dutthagāmanī, was probably near by (See Codrington, op.  cit., 20).  Sena I.  first made Pulatthipura the capital (Cv.l.9, 46, 85), though even before his time it seems to have been used as a royal residence - e.g., by Aggabodhi IV.  (Cv.xlvi.34), Aggabodhi VII.  (Ibid.,xlviii.74), and Udaya I.  (Ibid.,xlix.9, 18), who built a hospital there.  Kassapa IV.is also mentioned as building a hospital against an epidemic (Cv.lii.25).  [/p][p]Mahinda II.  built in the city the Dāmavihāra parivena and the Sannīratittha vihāra (Cv.xlviii.134).  Sena I.  reigned in Pulatthipura for twenty years and erected there several buildings, including the Senaggabodhi shrine near the Thusavāpī (Ibid.,l.73).  The successors of Sena I.  found in Pulatthipura a certain amount of protection from the inroads of the Colas and the Pāndiyans; but in the time of Sena V.  the town fell into the hands of the Damilas, through the treachery of Sena's mother and his commander in chief, Sena.  But Sena V.  recovered the city by making a treaty with his commander in chief (Ibid., liv.64, 68).  About 1017 A.C.  the Colas overran the country, captured Pulatthipura, and made the reigning king, Mahinda V., their prisoner.  He died, after twelve years, as a prisoner in India (Ibid.,lv.22ff).  During this period many of the Hindu shrines in the city were erected.[/p][p]For many years the Colas held the sovereignty of the city, though the Singhalese made several vain attempts to drive them out.  The Colas named the city Jananāthapura and put down all rebellion with a strong hand.  Finally, a young prince named Kitti, born about 1039 A.C., assumed the title of Vijayabāhu and determined to rescue Pulatthipura.  His first attempts failed, partly owing to rebellion among his own people; but finally, civil war broke out in the Cola country itself, and thus, about 1070, he captured Pulatthipura after a great deal of fierce fighting both on sea and land.  But, owing to dissensions among his subjects, it was only several years later that he was able to hold his coronation (Cv.lvii.66; lviii.22 ff.; lix.6 ff).  He renamed the city Vijayarājapura, and erected there many religious buildings, chief among which was the Temple of the Tooth Relic (Ibid.,lx.2ff).  It was not, however, till the time of Parakkamabāhu I.  that Palatthipura reached the pinnacle of its greatness.  He enlarged it to the size of four gāvutas in length and seven in width and called it Parakkamapura.  The city had three suburbs Rāvjavesībhujanga, Rājakulantaka and Vijita - and fourteen gates.  Parakkama adorned it with various parks, chief of which were the Nandanavana and the Dīpuyyāna, and with ponds and numerous buildings, both secular and religious (for details see chiefly Cv.lxxiii.1ff.; lxxviii.44 ff).  Kittinissanka added a stone temple for the Tooth Relic (Ibid., lxxx.19).  In the reign of Līlavatī, Lokissara captured the city and ruled there for nine months.  He was ousted by the general Parakkama, and later Parakkamapandu ruled as king, till he was deposed about 1215 A.C.  by Māgha of the Kalinga race, who, coming with a large host of Keralas and Malabars, captured the city and mercilessly plundered its possessions (Ibid., lxxxiii.15 ff).  From this spoliation the city never completely recovered, and it gradually lost its importance, though Parakkamabāhu II., Vijayabāhu IV.  and Parakkamabāhu III.  made attempts to restore it to its original splendour.

  <entry>[div class="huge"]Punna[/div][hr][h4]1. Punna, Punnaka Thera[/h4][p]He was born in the family of a householder of Suppāraka in the Sunāparanta country.  When he was grown up, he went with a great caravan of merchandise to Sāvatthi where, having heard the Buddha preach, he left the world and joined the Order.  He won favour by attention to his duties.  One day he asked the Buddha for a short lesson so that, having learnt it, he might go back to dwell in Sunāparanta.  The Buddha preached to him the Punnovāda Sutta (q.v.).  So Punna departed, and, in Sunāparanta, he became an arahant.  There he won over many disciples, both male and female, and having built for the Buddha a cell out of red sandalwood (Candanāsālā), he sent him a flower by way of invitation.  The Buddha came with five hundred arahants, spent a night in the cell, and went away before dawn.[/p][p]Ninety one kappas ago, when there was no Buddha alive, Punna was a learned brahmin, and later became a hermit in Himavā.  Near his abode a Pacceka Buddha died, and at the moment of his death there appeared a great radiance.  The ascetic cremated the body and sprinkled scented water on the pyre to extinguish the flames.  A deva, witnessing the event, prophesied his future greatness.  His name throughout his many lives was Punna or Punnaka.  Thag.  vs.  70; ThagA.i.156 ff.; Ap.ii.341.[/p][p]In Sunāparanta he first lived at Ambahatthapabbata, but, on being recognised by his brother, he went to Samuddagiri vihāra, where was a magnetised walk which none could use.  The waves of the sea breaking made great noise, and, in order to help him to concentration, Punna caused the sea to be quiet.  From there he went to Mātulagiri, where the incessant cries of birds disturbed him; he finally went to Makulakagāma.  While he was there, his brother Cūla Punna, with five hundred others, sailed in a trading ship, and, before embarking, he visited Punna, took the precepts from him, and asked for his protection during the voyage.  The ship reached an island where red sandalwood grew; with this the merchants filled the ship, and the spirits of the island, angered by this, raised a great storm and appeared before the sailors in fearful forms.  Each merchant thought of his guardian deity and Cūla Punna of his brother.  Punna, sensing his brother's need, travelled through the air to the ship, and, at sight of him, the spirits disappeared.  In gratitude for their deliverance, the merchants gave to the Elder a share of their sandalwood.  It was with this material that the Candanasālā, above referred to, was built.[/p][p]Kundadhāna was the first among the arahants to be chosen to accompany the Buddha to Sunāparanta.  Sakka provided five hundred palanquins for the journey, one of which was empty.  This was subsequently taken by the ascetic Saccabandha, whom the Buddha converted and ordained on the way.  On his return journey, the Buddha stopped at the river Nammadā, and was entertained there by the Nāga king.  MA.ii.1014 ff.; SA.iii.14ff.; KhA.149.[/p][hr][h4]2. Punna, Punnaka[/h4][p]A setthi of Rājagaha (DhA.i.385; iii.104), father of Uttarā Nanda-Mātā.  He had been a poor man and had worked for the setthi Sumana.  One feast day, though his master offered him a holiday, he went to work in the field, because he was too poor to be able to enjoy himself.  While he was in the field Sāriputta came to him, and Punna gave him a tooth stick and water.  Punna's wife, coming with her husband's food, met Sāriputta as he was coming away, and offered him the food she carried.  She cooked fresh rice and took it to her husband, who was overjoyed to hear of her gift to Sāriputta.  After the meal, he rested his head for a while on his wife's lap, and, on awaking, he found that the field he had ploughed had turned into gold.  He reported the matter to the king, who sent carts to fetch the gold; but as soon as his men touched it, saying that it was for the king, it turned again into earth.  The gold was, therefore, gathered in Punna's name, and the king conferred on him the rank of Bahudhanasetthi.  He built a new house, and, at the feast of inauguration, held a great almsgiving to the Buddha and the monks.  When the Buddha thanked him, he and his wife and his daughter Uttarā (q.v.) became sotāpannas.  MA.ii.812; DhA.iii.302 ff.; also VvA.62ff., where Punnaka's wife is called Uttarā.

(A.i.23; S.ii.156)[/p][p]In the time of Padumuttara Buddha, Punna was born in a rich brahmin family of Hamsavatī, before the birth of the Buddha.  When grown up, he one day visited the Buddha, and as he sat on the edge of a large crowd, hearing him preach, the Buddha declared one of his monks pre eminent among preachers, and Punna, wishing for a like honour under a future Buddha, paid great homage to Padumuttara.  (ThagA.i.37 ff )[/p][p]In the Anguttara Commentary (AA.i.113 ff), however, we are told that in the time of Padumuttara Buddha, Punna was named Gotama and was expert in the Vedas.  But he found no solace in the teaching of the Vedas and became an ascetic with a following of eighteen thousand Jatilas, all of whom, under his guidance, developed great iddhi powers.  Punna was already old when Padumuttara attained Enlightenment.  One day the Buddha visited Gotama's hermitage, and Gotama and his disciples entertained him to a meal.  Afterwards the Buddha wished his chief disciple Mahādeva to come to the hermitage with one hundred thousand monks; this he did, and the ascetics provided flowers for their seats.  For seven days the Buddha and his monks remained in trance on their seats, at the end of which period the Buddha asked the most pre eminent preacher to render thanks.  At the conclusion of the sermon, all except Gotama became arahants.  Gotama wished to gain pre eminence in preaching under a future Buddha, and Padumuttara proclaimed that his wish would find fulfilment.  The Apadāna (Ap.i.38, quoted at ThagA.i.362) contains yet another version, according to which Punna's name in the time of Padumuttara was Sunanda.[/p][p]Besides the Rathavinīta Sutta mentioned above (n.  1), which bears testimony to Punna's skill as a preacher, another Sutta, of the Samyutta Nikāya (S.iii.105f.; according to ThagA.ii.124, Ananda became a sotāpanna after hearing a sermon by Punna), represents Ananda as saying to the assembled monks that Punna was of great help to himself and others when they were yet novices; Punna had preached to them on causation, and they were able to understand the Doctrine because of his skilful exposition.[/p][p]It is, perhaps, this Punna who is identified with the gate keeper (dovārika) of the  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kurudhamma_jat_276,Kurudhamma Jātaka')"]Kurudhamma Jātaka[/a] (J.ii.381) and with one of the seven brothers of the  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bhisa_jat_488,Bhisa Jātaka')"]Bhisa Jātaka[/a] (J.iv.314).

The Buddha told him how, when he himself was in Atumā in the Bhusāgāra, there was a great thunderstorm which killed two peasants and four oxen, but that he had heard and seen nothing, so deep was his concentration.  Pukkusa was greatly impressed by this statement, and, having declared himself a follower of the Buddha, he gave to the Buddha two robes of cloth of gold, one of which, at the Buddha's suggestion, he handed to Ananda.  When Pukkusa had left, Ananda draped one robe over the Buddha, and was greatly astonished at its pale appearance in comparison with the deep gold of the Buddha's body (D.ii.130ff).

  <entry>[div class="huge"]Pilinda Vaccha, Pilindi Vaccha, Pilindiya Vaccha[/div][p]He was a brahmin of Sāvatthi, born before the Buddha's Enlightenment.  Pilinda was his personal name, Vaccha being that of his family.  He became a recluse and learnt the Cūla Gandhāra vijjā, but, when the Buddha appeared, the charm refused to work.  Having heard that the Mahā Gandhāra prevented the working of the Cūla Gandhāra and having concluded that the Buddha knew the former, he entered the Order at the Buddha's suggestion, in order to acquire it.  The Buddha gave him exercises in meditation, and he became an arahant.[/p][p]Certain devas who had been born in the deva world as a result of Pilinda's guidance in a former birth, out of gratitude, waited on him morning and evening.  He thus became famous as being dear to the devas, and was declared by the Buddha to be chief among such monks (A.i.24).[/p][p]In the time of Padumuttara Buddha, he was a rich householder of Hamsavatī and wished to become a monk beloved of the devas.  In the time of Sumedhā Buddha be was born in the world of men and paid great honour to the Buddha's Thūpa.  In a later existence he was a cakkavatti, named Varuna, and established his subjects in righteousness, so that after death they were born in heaven (ThagA.i.51f).[/p][p]Pilinda had a habit of addressing everyone as Vasala (outcaste).  When this was reported to the Buddha he explained that this was because Pilinda had, for one hundred lives, been born among Vasalavādī-Brahmins (Ud.iii.6; DhA.iv.181f).  One day, on entering Rājagaha, Pilinda met a man carrying a bowl of pipphalī (long pepper).  “What's in thy bowl, Vasala?" he asked, and the man, in anger, said, “The dung of mice." "So be it," said Pilinda, and the pepper turned into dung.  The man was horrified, and, seeking Pilinda, persuaded him to right the matter (AA.i.154f).[/p][p]The Vinaya Pitaka mentions that on several different occasions Pilinda suffered from various ailments and the Buddha had to give permission for the provision of suitable remedies.  Vin.i.204f.; some hold (e.g., Brethren 14, n.  4) that the Thera of Rājagaha, mentioned in the following stories, was distinct from the Thera of Sāvatthi.  See below.[/p][p]Once Bimbisāra found Pilinda, clearing a cave in order to provide a cell for himself.  The king promised to build a monastery for him if he could obtain the Buddha's sanction.  The permission was obtained and was reported to the king, but he forgot the matter until one hundred days later.  On remembering, he made ample amends, gave Pilinda five hundred attendants to look after the monastery, and granted for their maintenance a village, which came to be called Arāmikagāma or Pilindagāma.  One day, while in the village for alms, Pilinda went into a house where a girl was weeping because the day was a feast day and she had no ornament to wear, her parents being too poor to afford any.  Pilinda gave her a roll of grass to put round her head and it turned instantly into solid gold.  The king's officers, hearing of this wreath, suspected the family of theft and cast them into prison.  The next day Pilinda, discovering what had happened, visited the king and convinced him of his iddhi powers by turning the whole palace into gold.  The family was released, and the king and his courtiers gave to Pilinda large quantities of the five medicaments, all of which Pilinda distributed among those who wished for them.  Vin.i.206 ff.; iii.248ff.  This was the occasion for the forming of the rule that all medicaments required by a monk should be used within seven days.  It was in reference to this that the Gandhāra Jātaka (J.iii.363 ff.) was preached.  The incident of the palace being turned into gold is referred to at Kvu.608.[/p][p]Another story is related of Pilinda's iddhi powers (Vin.iii.67).  Once a family of Benares, which was wont to minister to Pilinda, was attacked by robbers and two girls were kidnapped.  Pilinda, by his iddhi power caused them to be brought back, and the monks complained of this to the Buddha, but the Buddha held that no wrong had been done.  The Apadāna (i.59f.; 302 16) has two sets of verses ascribed to Pilinda, the second very much longer than the first, thus supporting the view mentioned earlier, that there were two Theras named Pilindavaccha.  In any event, there has evidently been a confusion of legends, and it is no longer possible to separate them.  It is the first set of Apadāna verses which is quoted in the Theragāthā Commentary (Loc.  cit.).  In the second set we are told that in the time of Padumuttara Buddha, Pilinda was a very wealthy dovārika.  He took many precious gifts to Ananda, Padumuttara's father, and won from him a boon.  He asked, as his boon, that he should be allowed to entertain the Buddha.  The king refused to grant this, but the dovārika appealed to the judges and they gave the verdict in his favour.  Thereupon he held a great almsgiving of unparalleled splendour for seven days and gave away all manner of gifts.  As a result he was born one thousand times as king of the devas and one thousand times also as king of men.  In his last birth he suffered from neither heat nor cold, dust did not adhere to his body, and the rain did not wet him.[/p][hr]</entry>

Potthapāda, accepting the Buddha's views, was jeered at by his companions for doing so.  Two or three days later he again visited the Buddha with Citta Hatthisāriputta (q.v.), when the Buddha continued the earlier discussion on personality and the soul.

Later he was born in a family of fishermen near Kundinagara, but, remembering his past lives, he refused to take part in any fishing.  His parents therefore cast him out, but Ananda, finding him starving, gave him food, and, at the Buddha's suggestion, ordained him.  He soon became an arahant and dwelt with twelve others in Sānavāsipabbata.  Potthapāda's kinsmen became petas, and his parents sent to him a brother, of whom Potthapāda was specially fond, to plead for his intervention.  He therefore begged alms, and offered them to his colleagues in the name of his kinsmen, who thus regained happiness.  Pv.iii.2; PvA.177 ff.[/p][hr]</entry>

Wishing to rouse him to exert himself, the Buddha constantly referred to him as "Tuccha-Pothila." Pothila took the hint, and, travelling one hundred and twenty leagues, arrived at a forest hermitage where lived thirty monks.  He asked their leader to help him, but he referred him to a junior monk, who, in his turn, referred him on, and so on, until at last he was forced to apply to the seven year old novice who sat doing needlework.  With his pride humbled, Pothila asked him for advice.  In order to test him, the novice asked him to jump into a pool with his robes on.  This Pothila did, and the novice, satisfied as to his earnestness taught him how, in the case of an anthill with six holes into which a lizard entered, anyone, wishing to capture the lizard, would close up five of the holes.  So with the six doors of the senses; close five doors, and concentrate on the door of the mind.  At the end of the discourse, the Buddha appeared before Pothila in a ray of light and Pothila became an arahant (DhA.iii.417-21).

This blanket Tissa gave to his teacher, but the latter cut it up and used it as a spread, as an example to others (not to desire luxuries).  Tissa had his doubts set at rest and returned to Jambukola.  There, at the Vālīkāvāma, as he was sweeping the courtyard of the cetiya, other monks asked him questions in order to vex him.

A setthi's daughter, Sirivaddhā, gave him milk rice, while an ascetic, named Sirivaddha, gave him grass for his seat, under an āmanda (or āmalaka )tree.  His chief disciples were Sukhita (or Surakkhita) and Dhammasena among men and Cālā (or Sālā) and Upacālā (Upasālā) among women.  His personal attendant was Sambhiya.

Punna declares that even should they kill him, he would not bear them ill will, but would rejoice to be of use to them.  He leaves for Sunāparanta, with the Buddha's approval, and there gather around him five hundred disciples of either sex who have won arahantship.

The life of a recluse is the meanest of callings to be called a "scrap gatherer." It is entered on by householders solely as a means of escaping from woe.  The man who leaves the world and who yet does not fulfil the life of a recluse, is like a faggot from a funeral pyre, burnt at both ends and smeared with filth.

Pilotika, on being questioned, spoke very highly of the Buddha.  It is this conversation which, on its being repeated by Jānussoni to the Buddha, led to the preaching of the Cullahatthipadopama Sutta (M.i.175 ff).  Jānussoni addresses Pilotika as Vacchāyana, which, according to the Commentary, (MA.i.393) was the name of his clan.  From the same source we gather that the Paribbājaka's own name was Pilotikā; he was young, of a golden colour, and loved ministering to the Buddha and the Buddha's eminent disciples.  He is spoken of, together with Sabhiya (SA.ii.188), as a wise Paribbājaka.  Pilotika is identified with Devinda of the Mahā Ummagga Jātaka.  J.vi.478.[/p][hr][h4]2.

  <entry>[div class="huge"]Pokkharasāti, Pokkharasādi[/div][p]A Mahāsāla brahmin of great wealth and learning who lived in Ukkatthā, on a royal demesne given by Pasenadi.  Ambattha was the pupil of Pokkharasāti, who sent him to the Buddha at Icchānangala to discover if the report of the Buddha's greatness were true.  When Pokkharasāti heard later that Ambattha had been rude to the Buddha, he sought the Buddha by night and begged for his forgiveness.  The next day he invited the Buddha to a meal, and having listened to his teaching, declared himself his follower and became a sotāpanna (D.i.87f., 106ff).  Owing to his eminence, he was present at the meetings of the brahmins held in Manasākata (D.i.235) and Icchānangala (SN.p.115).  Vasettha, of the Vāsettha Sutta, was also his pupil (SN.vs.594).  In the Subha Sutta (M.ii.200ff)*, Subha Todeyyaputta, another disciple, is reported to have said that Pokkharasāti - here described as Opamañña (of the Upamañña clan) and lord of Subhagavana (Subhapvanika) treated as empty boasts the claims of brahmins and recluses to transcend ordinary human bonds and rise to the height of Ariyan knowledge.  This evidently refers to a time prior to his conversion.  The same Sutta mentions a slave girl of Pokkharasāti, Punnikā by name.[/p][blockquote][p]* the Vimānavatthu gives the name of another of his disciples, Chattamānava (q.v.), who was killed while bringing presents to his teacher.

Thereafter, scorning birth in the womb of a woman, he sprang to life in a lotus, which grew in a pond in Himāva.  An ascetic saw the lotus, adopted the boy, and taught him the Vedas.

At the time that he visited the Buddha with the other disciples he was 120 years old and very feeble.  At the end of his discussion with the Buddha, as recorded in the Pingiya Sutta (SN.  vs.  1120 23), because of his feebleness, he failed to reach any attainment.  Thereupon he praised the Buddha and begged of him to go on.  The Buddha preached to him further, and he became an anāgāmī, failing, however, to attain arahantship because his mind wandered to his maternal uncle, Bāvarī.  His one thousand pupils, however, became arahants.  Later, with the Buddha's leave, he visited Bāvarī and told him the glad tidings, describing the Buddha's glory (SN.vs.1131 45).  At the end of his statement, the Buddha, seeing that the minds of both of them were mature, sent forth a ray of light from Sāvatthi and, appearing before them, preached to them.

  <entry>[div class="huge"]Pūrana Kassapa[/div][p]One of the six well known teachers, contemporaneous with the Buddha.  He is said to have taught the doctrine of non-action (akiriya), denying the result of good or bad actions (D.i.52 f); probably the more correct description of Kassapa's teaching would be niskriyavāda - i.e., an affirmation that the soul is passive, unaffected by the good or the bad done by us, the ultimate reality lying beyond good or evil.[/p][p]Elsewhere (S.iii.69; v.126), however, he is mentioned as an ahetuvādin, denying hetupaccaya (condition and cause - i.e., the efficacy of kamma), which teaching, in the Sāmmaññaphala Sutta (D.i.53; see also A.iii.383, where the teaching of Chalabhijātiyo is also attributed to Pūrana), is attributed to Makkhali Gosāla.  [/p][p]Buddhaghosa says (DA.i.142; he could not have been a slave.  Kassapa is a brahmin gotta.  The SNA (372) calls him an ājīvaka) that Pūrana Kassapa came by his name from the fact that as a result of his birth the number of slaves in a certain household reached one hundred.  Owing to this fact he was never found fault with, even when he failed to do his work satisfactorily.  But, in spite of this, he was dissatisfied and fled from his masters.  He then had his clothes stolen by thieves and went about naked.  His gotta name was Kassapa.  He had a following of five hundred, among whom was the deva putta Asama (S.i.65, see also Ajātasattu).  He was consulted by the Licchavis Abhaya (S.v.126) and Mahāli (S.iii.68) and by the wanderer Vacchagotta (S.iv.398).  He claimed to be omniscient.  (A.iv.428; here we probably have a more correct explanation of his name, Pūrana i.e., in his claim to have attained perfect wisdom, pūranañānna).  [/p][p]A story in the Dhammapada Commentary (DhA.iii.208)* states that when the heretics were unable to prevent the Buddha from performing the Twin Miracle under the Gandamba, they fled discomfited.  Pūrana Kassapa was among them, and in the course of his flight, he came across one of his followers, a farmer, who was on his way to see him, carrying a vessel of broth and a rope.  Pūrana took the vessel and the rope, and going to the banks of the river near Sāvatthi, tied the vessel round his neck and threw himself into the stream.  There was a circle of bubbles on the water and Pūrana was reborn in Avīci.  The Milindapañha (p.  4 f) also mentions a Pūrana Kassapa, contemporary with Milinda.  This perhaps refers to a teacher descended from the same school who is credited with the view that the earth rules or sustains the world.  v.l.

Pukkusāti recognised the Buddha at the end of the sermon and begged his forgiveness for not having paid him due honour; he then begged to have the upasampadā conferred on him.

A friendly alliance was established between the two kings through the medium of merchants who travelled between the two countries for purposes of trade.  In the course of time, although the two kings had never seen each other, there grew up between them a deep bond of affection.  Pukkusāti once sent to Bimbisāra, as a gift, eight priceless garments in lacquered caskets.  This gift was accepted at a special meeting of the whole court, and Bimbisāra having nothing of a material nature, which he considered precious enough to send to Pukkusāti, conceived the idea of acquainting Pukkusāti with the appearance in the world of the Three Jewels (ratanāni) the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha.  He had inscribed on a golden plate, four cubits long and a span in breadth, descriptions of these Three Jewels and of various tenets of the Buddha's teachings, such as the satipatthānā, the Noble Eightfold Path, and the Thirty seven factors of Enlightenment.  This plate was placed in the innermost of several caskets of various precious substances, and was taken in procession on the back of the state elephant up to the frontier of Bimbisira's kingdom.  Similar honours were paid to it by the chiefs of other territories, through which lay the route to Takkasilā.  [/p][p]When Pukkusāti, in the solitude of his chamber, read the inscription on the plate, he was filled with boundless joy and decided to renounce the world.  He cut off his hair, donned the yellow robes of a monk, and left the palace alone amid the lamentations of his subjects.  He travelled the one hundred and ninety two leagues to  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/saavatthi,Sāvatthi')"]Sāvatthi[/a], passing the gates of  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/j/jetavana,Jetavana')"]Jetavana[/a]; but having understood from Bimbisāra's letter that the Buddha was at Rājagaha, he omitted to enquire for him at Jetavana, and travelled on forty five leagues more to Rājagaha, only to find that the Buddha was all the time in Sāvatthi.  As it was then evening, he took lodging in Bhaggava's house.  The Buddha, with his divine eye, saw what was in store for Pukkusāti, and travelling on foot from Sāvatthi, reached Bhaggava's house at sundown, and, waiting his opportunity, engaged Pukkusāti in talk and preached to him the Dhātuvibhanga Sutta, as related above.

  <entry>[div class="huge"]Bhūridatta Jātaka (No.543)[/div][p]Prince Brahmadatta, son of the king of Benares, lived on the banks of the Yamunā, exiled from his father's kingdom.  He wore the garb of an ascetic, but his heart was not in the ascetic life, and, when a Nāga maiden tried to seduce him, he easily succumbed.  Their children were Sāgara Brahmadatta and Samuddajā.  When the king of Benares died, Brahmadatta returned with his children to the kingdom and his Nāga wife returned to the Nāga world.  While playing about in a lake specially prepared for them, the children of Brahmadatta discovered a tortoise, Cittacūla, and were much frightened.  Cittacūla was brought before the king and was ordered to be cast into the Yamunā, that being the direst penalty the king could envisage.  Caught in a whirlpool, Cittacūla was carried to the realm of the Nāgaking Dhatarattha, and, when questioned, had the presence of mind to say that he had been sent from Benares to propose a marriage between Dhatarattha and Samuddajā.  Nāga messengers were sent to the Benares court to make arrangements, and they laid their proposal before the king.  Cittacūla had meanwhile spirited himself away.  Brahmadatta was horrified at the proposals of the messengers, and did not fail to say so, whereupon Dhatarattha was so incensed at the insult offered to him that he laid siege to Benares with his Nāga hosts.  To avert the total destruction of the city, Samuddajā was given to Dhatarattha, with whom she dwelt for a long time without discovering that she was in the Nāga world, everyone, at the king's orders, having assumed human form.  Samuddajā had four children Sudassana, Datta, Subhaga and Arittha (Kānārittha) - and one step daughter, Accimukhī.  Datta, who was the Bodhisatta, used to visit Virūpakkha, the ruler of the Nāga hosts, and one day went with him to pay homage to Sakka.  In the assembly a question arose which only Datta could answer, and Sakka was so pleased with him that he gave him the name of Bhūridatta (wise Datta).  Anxious to be born in Sakka's company, Bhūridatta took the vows and observed the fast, lying on the top of an ant hill.  At the end of the fast, Nāga maidens would come and take him back.[/p][p]One day a brahmin villager and his son, Somadatta, went hunting in the forest and spent the night on a banyan tree near where Bhūridatta lay.  At dawn, these two saw the Nāga maidens come for Bhūridatta and witnessed their song and dance, which Bhūridatta, having laid aside his snake form, much enjoyed.  Discovering the presence of the villagers, Bhūridatta entered into conversation with them, and invited them to the Nāga world, where they passed a whole year, enjoying great luxury.  Owing to lack of merit, the villagers grew discontented and wished to return to the world of men on the pretext that they wished to become ascetics.  Bhūridatta offered them a wish conferring jewel, but this they refused, saying that they had no use for it.  Once in the world of men, Somadatta and his father took off their ornaments to bathe, but these divine ornaments disappeared to the Nāga world.[/p][p]Some time later, while father and son were wandering about in the forest, having returned from stalking deer, they met a brahmin called  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/aa/aalambaayana,Alambāyana')"]Alambāyana[/a], who possessed a Nāga jewel.  He was a poor man of Benares who had fled into the forest to escape his creditors.  There he had met an ascetic, Kosiya, to whom a Garuda king had taught the Ālambāyana spell which was potent to tame Nāgas.  The Garuda had torn up a banyan tree, which shaded the ascetic's walk.  A Nāga, which the Garuda had seized, coiled itself round the tree, but the Garuda carried the tree with the Nāga on it.  When he discovered that he had done the ascetic an injury in pulling up the tree, he felt repentant and taught the ascetic the Ālambāyana spell by way of atonement.  The ascetic, in turn, taught it to the poor brahmin, hoping it would help him.  The brahmin, now called Ālambāyana, left the ascetic and, while wandering about, came across some Nāgas, carrying Bhūridatta's jewel.  They heard him recite the spell and fled in terror, leaving behind them the jewel, which he picked up.[/p][p]When Somadatta and his father met the brahmin, they saw the jewel, and the father schemed to steal it.  He told Ālambāyana of the difficulties connected with guarding the jewel and of how dangerous it might prove, if not duly honoured.  If Ālambāyana would give him the jewel, he would show him the abode of Bhūridatta, whom the brahmin might then capture, making money with his help.  When Somadatta realized his father's treachery, he rebuked him and fled from him.  Ālambāyana went with the villager and captured Bhūridatta and crushed his bones.  Having thus rendered the Nāga helpless.  Ālambāyana put him in a basket and travelled about making him dance before large audiences The jewel, which Ālambāyana gave to the treacherous villager, slipped from the later's hand and returned to the Nāga world.[/p][p]On the day of the capture of Bhūridatta, his mother had a terrifying dream, and later, when Bhūridatta had been absent for a month, she grew very anxious and lamented piteously.  A search was instituted - Kānārittha was sent to the deva world, Subhaga to Himavā, Sudassana and Accimukhī to the world of men.  Sudassana went disguised as an ascetic, and Accimukhī, assuming the form of a frog, hid in his matted hair.  They found Ālambāyana making ready to give an exhibition of Bhūridatta's dancing before the king of Benares.  Sudassana took up his stand at the edge of the crowd, and Bhūridatta, seeing him, went up to him.  The crowd retreated in fear.  When Bhūridatta was back in his basket, Sudassana challenged Ālambāyana to prove that his magic powers were greater than those of Sudassana.  This challenge was accepted, and Sudassana called out to Accimukhī who, uttering the frog's cry, stood on his shoulder, and having spat drops of poison on to his palm, went back into his hair.  Saying that the country would be destroyed if the poison fell on the earth, Sudassana had three holes dug, and filled the first with drugs, the second with cow dung, and the third with heavenly medicines.  He poured the poison into the first hole; a flame instantly burst out, spread to the second, and, having travelled on to the third, consumed all the medicines and was extinguished.  Ālambāyana was standing near the last hole: the heat of the poison smote him, the colour of his skin changed, and he became a leper.  Filled with terror, he set the Nāga free.  Bhūridatta assumed a radiant form decked with all ornaments; so did Sudassana and Accimukhī.  The king, on discovering that they were the children of Samuddajā, rejoiced greatly and entertained them.  Bhūridatta returned to the Nāga world, the king accompanying him.  The king stayed there for some days and then returned to his kingdom.[/p][p]Subhaga, in the course of his wanderings, came across Somadatta's father, and, on discovering that it was he who had betrayed Bhūridatta, snatched him away into the Nāga world, after first nearly drowning him in the whirlpools of the Yamunā.  Kānārittha, who was guarding the entrance to the room where Bhūridatta lay ill and tired after his experiences, protested against Subhaga's ill treatment of a brahmin, and described the greatness of the brahmins and the importance of holding sacrifices and of learning the Vedas.  The Nāgas, who were listening, were greatly impressed, and Bhūridatta, seeing them in danger of accepting false doctrine, sent for Kānārittha, confuted his arguments, and converted the Nāgas to the right view.  Some time after, Bhūridatta, with his retinue, and followed by Dhatarattha, Samuddajā, and their other children, visited his grandfather Brahmadatta, who had become an ascetic.  There they met Sāgara Brahmadatta, now king of Benares, and great was the rejoicing over their reunion.  Samuddajā then returned with her family to the Nāga world, where they lived happily to the end of their days.[/p][p]The story was related in reference to some laymen of Sāvatthi who kept the fast diligently.[/p][p]Devadatta is identified with Ālambāyana, Ananda with Somadatta, Uppalavannā with Accimukhī, Sāriputta with Sudassana, Moggallāna with Subhaga, and Sunakkhatta with Kānārittha (J.vi.157 219).[/p][p]The story of Bhūridatta is found also in the Cariyāpitaka (Cyp.ii.2) as the Bhūridatta cariyā, to illustrate Sīlapāramitā.  In the fifteenth century Ratthasāra, a monk of Ava, wrote a metrical version of the Bhūridatta Jātaka.  Sās.99.[/p][hr]</entry>

  <entry>[div class="huge"]Bimbisāra[/div][p]King of Magadha and patron of the Buddha.  [/p][p]He ascended the throne at the age of fifteen and reigned in Rājagaha for fifty two years.  The Buddha was five years older than Bimbisāra, and it was not until fifteen years after his accession that Bimbisāra heard the Buddha preach and was converted by him.  It is said (Mhv.ii.25ff.; Dpv.iii.50ff ) that the two were friends in their youth owing to the friendship which existed between their fathers.  Bimbisāra's father was called Bhāti (MT.137; Dpv.iii.52); according to Tibetan sources (Rockhill, op.  cit., 16) he was called Mahāpaduma and his Mother Bimbī.[/p][p]But according to the Pabbajā Sutta (SN.vs.405ff.; also J.i.66 and DhA.i.85; also Rockhill, p.  27) the first meeting between the Buddha and Bimbisāra took place in Rājagaha under the Pandavapabbata, only after the Buddha's Renunciation.  The king, seeing the young ascetic pass below the palace windows, sent messengers after him.  On learning, that he was resting after his meal, Bimbisāra followed him and offered him a place in his court.  This the Buddha refused, revealing his identity.  The Commentary adds (SNA.ii.386) that Bimbisāra wished him success in his quest and asked him to visit first Rājagaha as soon as he had attained Enlightenment.  It was in fulfilment of this promise that the Buddha visited Rājagaha immediately after his conversion of the Tebhātika Jatilā.  He stayed at the Supatittha cetiya in Latthivanuyyāna, whither Bimbisāra, accompanied by twelve nahutas of householders, went to pay to him his respects.  The Buddha preached to them, and eleven nahutas, with Bimbisāra at their head, became sotāpannas.  On the following day the Buddha and hiss large retinue of monks accepted the hospitality of Bimbisāra.  Sakka, in the guise of a young man, preceded them to the palace, singing songs of glory of the Buddha.  At the conclusion of the meal, Bimbisāra poured water from a golden jar on the Buddha's hand and dedicated Veluvana for the use of him and of his monks (Vin.i.35ff).  [/p][p]It was this gift of Veluvana, which formed the model for Devānampiyatissa's gift of the Mahāmeghavana to Mahinda (Mhv.xv.17).  The gift of Veluvana was one of the incidents sculptured in the Relic chamber of the Mahā Thūpa (Mhv.xxx.80).  It may have been in Veluvana that the king built for the monks a storeyed house, fully plastered (Vin.ii.154).  With the attainment of sopātatti, the king declared that all the five ambitions of his life had been fulfilled: that he might become king, that the Buddha might visit his realm, that he might wait on the Buddha, that the Buddha might teach him the doctrine, that he might understand it (Vin.i.36).  According to BuA.  (p.  18f.) the king became a Sotāpanna after listening to the Mahā-Nārada Jātaka.[/p][p]From this moment up till the time of his death, a period of thirty seven years, Bimbisāra did all in his power to help on the new religion and to further its growth.  He set an example to his subjects in the practice of the precepts by taking the uposatha vows on six days, of each month (PvA.209).[/p][p]Bimbisāra's chief queen was Kosaladevī (q.v.), daughter of Mahākosala and sister of Pasenadi.  On the day of her marriage she received, as part of her dowry, a village in Kāsi, for her bath money.  Her son was Ajātasattu (also J.iii.121).  Bimbisāra had other wives as well; Khemā, who, at first, would not even visit the Buddha till enticed by Bimbisāra's descriptions of the beauties of Veluvana; and the courtesan Padumavatī, who was brought from Ujjenī, with the help of a Yakkha, so that Rājagaha might not lack a Nagarasobhinī.  Both these later became nuns.  Padumavatī's son was Abhaya.  Bimbisāra had another son by Ambapālī, known as Vimala Kondañña, and two others, by different wives, known as Sīlava and Jayasena.  A daughter, Cundi, is also mentioned.[/p][p]Bimbisāra's death, according to the Commentaries, was a sad one (E.g., DA.i.135 ff.; see also Vin.ii.190f).  Soothsayers had predicted, before the birth of Ajātasattu, that he would bring about the death of his father, for which reason his mother had wished to bring about an abortion.  But Bimbisāra would not hear of this, and when the boy was born, treated him with the greatest affection (for details see Ajātasattu).  When the prince came of age, Devadatta, by an exhibition of his iddhi-power, won him over to his side and persuaded him to encompass the death of his father, Bimbisāra's patronage of the Buddha being the greatest obstacle in the path of Devadatta.  The plot was discovered, and Bimbisāra's ministers advised him to kill Ajātasattu, Devadatta and their associates.  But Bimbisāra sent for Ajātasattu and, on hearing that he desired power, abdicated in his favour.  Devadatta chided Ajātasattu for a fool.  "You are like a man who puts a skin over a drum in which is a rat," and he urged on Ajātasattu the need for the destruction of Bimbisāra.[/p][p]But no weapon could injure Bimbisāra (probably because he was a Sotāpanna, he also had the power of judging the status of anyone by his voice - e.g., in the case of Kumbhaghosa, DhA.i.233), it was therefore decided that he should be starved to death, and with this end in view he was imprisoned in a hot house (tāpanageha) with orders that none but the mother of Ajātasattu should visit him.  On her visits she took with her a golden vessel filled with food which she concealed in her clothes.  When this was discovered she took food in her head dress (molī), and, later, she was obliged to take what food she could conceal in her footgear.  But all these ways were discovered, and then the queen visited Bimbisāra after having bathed in scented water and smeared her person with catumadhura (the four kinds of sweets).  The king licked her person and that was his only sustenance.  In the end the visits of the queen were forbidden; but the king continued to live by walking about his cell meditating.  Ajātasattu, hearing of this, sent barbers to cut open his feet, fill the wounds with salt and vinegar, and burn them with coals.  It is said that when the barbers appeared Bimbisāra thought his son had relented and had sent them to shave him and cut his hair.  But on learning their real purpose, he showed not the least resentment and let them do their work, much against their will.  (In a previous birth he had walked about in the courtyard of a cetiya with shoes on, hence this punishment!) Soon after, Bimbisāra died, and was reborn in the Cātummahārājika world as a Yakkha named Janavasabbha, in the retinue of Vessavana.  The Janavasabha Sutta records an account of a visit paid by Janavasabha to the Buddha some time after.[/p][p]A son was born to Ajātasattu on the day of Bimbisāra's death.  The joy be experienced at the birth of his son made him realize something of the affection his own father must have felt for him, and he questioned his mother.  She told him stories of his childhood, and he repented, rather belatedly, of his folly and cruelty.  Soon after, his mother died of grief, and her death gave rise to the protracted war between Ajātasattu and Pasenadi, as mentioned elsewhere (J.ii.237, 403).[/p][p]The books contain no mention of any special sermons preached by the Buddha to Bimbisāra nor of any questions asked by him of the Buddha.  [/p][p]When he heard that the Buddha intended to perform a miracle, although he had ordered his disciples to refrain from doing so, Bimbisāra had doubts about the propriety of this and questioned the Buddha who set his doubts at rest (DhA.iii.204; J.iii.263f.).  It was also at the request of Bimbisāra that the Buddha established the custom of the monks assembling on the first, eighth, fourteenth and fifteenth days of each month (Vin.i.101f.).[/p][p]Perhaps, like Anāthapindika, his equal in devotion to the Buddha, he refrained from giving the Buddha extra trouble, or perhaps the affairs of his kingdom, which was three hundred leagues in extent, did not permit him enough leisure for frequent visits to the Buddha.  (DhA.iii.205; the kingdom included eighty thousand villages, gāma, Vin.i.179).[/p][p]It is said that he once visited four monks - Godhika, Subāhu, Valliya and Uttiya - and invited them to spend the rainy season at Rājagaha.  He built for them four huts, but forgot to have them roofed, with the result that the gods withheld the rains until the king remembered the omission (ThagA.i.125).  He similarly forgot his promise to give Pilindavaccha a park keeper, if the Buddha would sanction such a gift.  Five hundred days later he remembered his promise and to make amends, gave five hundred park keepers with a special village for their residence, called Ārāmikagāma or Pilindagāma (Vin.i.207f.).[/p][p]Bimbisāra's affection for the Buddha was unbounded.  When the Licchavis sent Mahāli, who was a member of Bimbisāra's retinue, to beg the Buddha to visit Vesāli, Bimbisāra did not himself try to persuade the Buddha to do so, but when the Buddha agreed to go he repaired the whole road from Rājagaha to the Ganges - a distance of five leagues - for the Buddha to walk upon; he erected a rest house at the end of each league, and spread flowers of five different colours knee deep along the whole way.  Two parasols were provided for the Buddha and one for each monk.  The king himself accompanied the Buddha in order to look after him, offering him flowers and perfume and all requisites throughout the journey, which lasted five days.  Arrived at the river, he fastened two boats together decked with flowers and jewels and followed the Buddha's boat into the water up to his neck.  When the Buddha had gone, the king set up an encampment on the river bank, awaiting his return; he then escorted him back to Rājagaha with similar pomp and ceremony (DhA.iii.438 ff).[/p][p]Great cordiality existed between Bimbisāra and Pasenadi.  They were connected by marriage, each having married a sister of the other.  Pasenadi once visited Bimbisāra in order to obtain from him a person of unbounded wealth (amitabhoga) for his kingdom.  Bimbisāra had five such - Jotiya, Jatila, Mendaka, Punnaka and Kākavaliya; but Pasenadi had none.  The request was granted, and Mendaka's son, Dhanañjaya, was sent back to Kosala with Pasenadi (DhA.i.385f.; AA.i.220).  Some of these were richer than Bimbisāra- e.g., Jotiya (q.v.), whose house was built entirely of jewels while the king's palace was of wood; but the king showed no jealousy (DhA.iv.211).[/p][p]Bimbisāra also maintained friendly relations with other kings, such as Pukkasāti, king of Takkasilā, Candappajjota, king of Ujjenī, to whom he sent his own physician Jīvaka to tend in his illness - and Rudrāyana of Roruka (Dvy.545).[/p][p]Among the ministers and personal retinue of Bimbisāra are mentioned Sona-Kolvisa, the flower gatherer Sumana who supplied the king with eight measures of jasmine flowers, the minister Koliya, the treasurer Kumbbaghosaka and his physician Jīvaka.  The last named was discovered for him by the prince Abhaya when he was suffering from a fistula.  The king's garments were stained with blood and his queens mocked him.  Jīvaka cured the king with one single anointing; the king offered him the ornaments of the five hundred women of the palace, and when he refused to take these, he was appointed physician to the king, the women of the seraglio and the fraternity of monks under the Buddha (Vin.i.272f).[/p][p]When Dhammadinnā wished to leave the world, Bimbisāra gave her, at her husband's request, a golden palanquin and allowed her to go round the city in procession (MA.i.516).[/p][p]Bimbisāra is generally referred to as Seniya Bimbisāra.  The Commentaries explain Seniya as meaning "possessed of a large following" or as "belonging to the Seniyagotta," and Bimbisāra as meaning "of a golden colour," bimbī meaning gold (e.g., UdA.104).  According to Tibetan sources, Bimbī was the name of his mother, and from this his own name was derived; but another reason was that he was radiant like the morning sun (Rockhill 16, See also MA.i.292).[/p][p]In the time of Phussa Buddha, when the Buddha's three step brothers, sons of King Jayasena, obtained their father's leave to entertain the Buddha for three months, Bimbisāra, then head of a certain district, looked after all the arrangements.  His associates in this task were born as petas, and he gave alms to the Buddha in their name in order to relieve their sufferings.[/p][p]See Tirokudda Sutta, also PvA.21ff.; for his intercession on behalf of another pets.  see PvA.89.[/p][p]During his lifetime, Bimbisāra was considered the happiest of men, but the Buddha declared (e.g., M.i.95) that he himself was far happier than the king.[/p][p]The kahāpana in use in Rājagaha during Bimbisāra's time was the standard of money adopted by the Buddha in the formation of those rules into which the matter of money entered (Sp.ii.297).[/p][p]Bimbisāra had a white banner and one of his epithets was Pandaraketu (Thag.vs.64; ThagA.i.147).  Nothing is said about his future destiny, but he is represented in the Janavasabha Sutta (D.ii.206) as expressing the wish to become a Sakadāgāmī, and this wish may have been fulfilled.[/p][hr]</entry>

The Bodhisiatta was a stone cutter, working a quarry near the mouse's residence.  She, liking him, brought him one day a coin, suggesting that, with a part of it, he should buy her some meat.  The Bodhisatta agreed, and this continued for some time.  One day the mouse was caught by a cat, but she obtained her release by promising him some of her food.  She was later caught by three other cats, but was let free on the same terms.  The mouse thus had only one fifth of her food and grew very thin.  The Bodhisiatta noticed this, and when she told him the reason, he put her inside a crystal box and suggested that when the cats came she should refuse to have anything to do with them.  The first cat arrived and, on being reviled by the mouse, jumped on the crystal box and was crushed to death.  The same fate overtook the other cats.  The mouse thus became free, and in gratitude to the Bodhisatta, showed him all the treasure.[/p][p]The story was told in reference to [b]Kānā[/b] (q.v.), who lost her husband owing to four monks.

Each protested his innocence and swore an oath that heavy curses should attend them if any were guilty of stealing so much as a lotus stalk (bhisa).  In each case punishment was to be that in their next birth they should have lands, possessions and other encumbrances - which, from an ascetic's point of view, would be a grievous thing.

In the time of Kassapa Buddha she had been a slave in a brahmin's house.  The brahmin, whose name was Asoka, invited eight monks to feed daily at his house and asked his wife to arrange to feed them at a cost of one kahāpana each.  This she refused to do as did also his daughters; but their slave agreed to carry out this work, and she did it most conscientiously and with great devotion.  As a result she was reborn in heaven (J.vi.117f).  Her palace was twelve leagues in height and one in extent; it possessed nine storeys and one thousand rooms.  When Dutthagāmanī wished to erect the Lohapāsāda, he asked the monks for a plan, and eight arahants went to the deva world and returned with a plan of Bīranī's palace.  Mhv.xxvii.9ff.[/p][hr]</entry>

The Buddha answers in the negative and describes in detail the high moral standard of the lives of ancient brahmins.  In course of time, however, the brahmins were disturbed by the sight of the king's wealth and adomed and bejewelled women, and became covetous of these.  They thereupon induced the king to make offerings and hold sacrifices of animals that these might be for their own gain.

  <entry>[div class="huge"]Buddhaghosa [/div][hr][h4]1. Buddhaghosa Thera[/h4][p]The greatest of Commentators on the Tipitaka.  He was a Brahmin.  The Sās.

He was born in a village near Buddhagayā and became proficient in the Vedas and allied branches of knowledge.  One day he met a monk, named Revata, and on being defeated by him in controversy, entered the Order to learn the Buddha's teachings.  Because his speech was profound, like that of the Buddha, and because his words spread throughout the world (like those of the Buddha), he came to be called Buddhaghosa.  While dwelling with Revata, he wrote the Ñānodaya and the Atthasālinī, and also began to write a Parittatthakathā (a concise commentary) on the Tipitakas.  In order to complete his task, he came over to Ceylon at the suggestion of Revata (Sās.p.29, says he was sent to Ceylon as punishment for thinking himself wiser than his teachers) and studied the Singhalese Commentaries at the Mahāvihāra, under Sanghapāla.  When his studies were ended he wrote the Visuddhimagga, and having thereby won the approval of the Elders of the Mahāvihāra, he rendered the Singhalese Commentaries into Pāli.  During this period he lived in the Ganthākaravihāra, and on the accomplishment of his task he returned to Jambudīpa.  (Burmese tradition says he obtained his copy of the Tipitaka and the Commentaries from the Āloka vihāra.  But see P.L.C.83, n.1.4).[/p][p]Besides the above mentioned works of Buddhaghosa, we have also the Samantapāsādikā and the Kankhāvitaranī on the Vinaya Pitaka; the Sumangalavilāsinī, the Papañcasūdanī, the Sāratthappakāsinī and the Manorathapūranī on the Sutta Pitaka.  He is also said to have compiled Commentaries on the Khuddakapātha and the Sutta Nipāta (called the Paramatthajotikā) and on the Dhammapada.  He also wrote a series of Commentaries on the Abhidhamma Pitaka (the Atthasālinī, the Sammohavinodanī and the Pañcappakaranatthakathā).  Some ascribe to him the Jātakatthakathā.

He could only get as far as telling the king he had a favour to ask, and then his heart failed him, for, he said to himself, it made a man weep to have to ask and it made a man weep to have to refuse.  In the end the king noticed his discomfiture and offered him all his possessions; but the ascetic would take only the shoes and the parasol, and, with these, he left for the Himālaya.

When he needed food, after samāpatti he would sprinkle water on the rice and eat it instead of going for alms.

[/p][p]The Dhammapada Commentary (DhA.ii.171), however, states that the offence was committed after the rule was laid down, and, because the food was stored, not because of greed but through lack of covetousness, the Buddha declared Balatthasīsa free from guilt.[/p][p]Belatthasīsa was a brahmin of  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/saavatthi,Sāvatthi')"]Sāvatthi[/a] who had left the world under  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/uruvela_kassapa,Uruvela Kassapa')"]Uruvela Kassapa[/a] before the Buddha's Enlightenment and was converted when Uruvela Kassapa became a follower of the Buddha.

[/p][p]The reading Bālakalonakāragāma occurs in the Majjhima Commentary (MA.ii.596); but even here two explanations are given: one to the effect that Bālaka was the name of a village of salt makers (? lonakāragāma) belonging to Upāli phapati.  When the inhabitants of the village came to Upāli with their taxes, he went with them (bālakagāmavāsiniyā .  .  .  parisāya) to see Nigantha Nātaputta.  [/p][p]The other explanation is that the word bālakiniyā in the text is an adjective meaning "composed of fools" (bālavatiyā bālussannāya) (Cp.,J.i.246, where mention is made of bālagāmikamanussā who were obviously fools).  The confusion seems, therefore, to have arisen very early.  Upāli's village (of Bāka), if such a place existed, was probably near Nālandā.[/p][hr]</entry>

  <entry>[div class="huge"]Bhātikābhaya[/div][p]Also called Bhātika or Bhātiya.  Son of Kutakannatissa and king of Ceylon for twenty eight years (38 66 A.C.).  He was called Bhātika or Bhātiya because he was the elder brother of Mahādāthika Mahānāga.  He was very pious, and once had the whole of the Mahā Thūpa covered with sandalwood paste in which were embedded sweet smelling flowers.  On another occasion he covered the whole thūpa with flowers and sprinkled them with water drawn by machines from the Abhaya-vāpi.  He made a plaster covering for the Mahā Thūpa into which were mixed many, cartloads of pearls.  A net of coral was made and thrown over the cetiya, and in its meshes were fastened lotus flowers of gold, as large as wagon wheels.  One day the king heard the sound of the chanting of arahants in the relic chamber of the Mahā Thūpa, and he lay down resolving not to rise until he had seen them.  The theras made a door by which he could enter, and, having seen the glories of the chamber, he described them for the benefit of the people, making figures in illustration of his descriptions.  Bhātikābhaya did many other works of merit, held Vesākha festivals, organized offerings for the Bodhi tree, and showed great hospitality to the monks at various places.  He was succeeded by his brother Mahādāthika Mahānāga (Mhv.xxxiv.38ff.; MT.553f).[/p][p]Bhātikābhaya once heard of a skilful judgment being given by Abhidhammika Godha Thera and laid down a rule that all disputes should be taken to the Elder for settlement (Sp.ii.307).  On another occasion he appointed a brahmin minister, named Dīghakārāyana, to settle a controversy between the monks of Abhayagiri and those of the Mahāvihāra (Sp.iii.583).  He had a queen called Sāmadevī who was the daughter of a cattle butcher.  A large number of cattle butchers were once brought before the king, but as they were unable to pay the fine demanded, he appointed them as scavengers in the palace.  One of them had a beautiful daughter, and the king fell in love with her and married her.  Owing to her, her kinsmen, too, lived in happiness (VibhA.440).[/p][p]Bhātikābhaya once heard a Sutta (see A.v.21f ) in which the Buddha had declared that, of all perfumes, that of jasmine was the strongest.  In order to test this the king filled a room with the four kinds of perfume and then placed in it handfuls of various flowers, including jasmine.  He then left the room and shut the door.  After a while he entered again, and the first scent which greeted him was that of jasmine.  Convinced of the truth of the Buddha's statement, he fell prostrate and worshipped him (AA.ii.819).  [/p][p]It is said (SA.ii.180) that the king once asked a reciter to tell him of an auspicious stanza (jayamangala) connected with all the Three Jewels.  After thinking for a while, he recited the stanza beginning divā tapati ādicco, ratti ābhāti candimā (S.ii.284).  At the end of the first pāda, the reciter saluted the setting sun, at the end of the second the rising moon, at the end of the third the Sangha, and at the end of the stanza he stretched his hands upwards in salutation of the Mahā Thūpa.  The king asked him to hold his hands there and placed in them one thousand pieces.[/p][hr]</entry>

  <entry>[div class="huge"]Brahmlakoka[/div][p]The highest of the celestial worlds, the abode of the Brahmas.  It consists of twenty heavens: [/p][ul][li]the nine ordinary Brahma-worlds, [/li][li]the five Suddhāvāsā, [/li][li]the four Arūpa worlds, [/li][li]the Asaññasatta and [/li][li]the Vehapphala (e.g., VibhA.521).  [/li][/ul][p]All except the four Arūpa worlds are classed among the Rūpa worlds (the inhabitants of which are corporeal).  The inhabitants of the Brahma worlds are free from sensual desires (but see the Mātanga Jātaka, J.iv.378, where Ditthamangalikā is spoken of as Mahābrahmabhariyā, showing that some, at least, considered that Mahābrahmas had wives).  [/p][p]The Brahma world is the only world devoid of women (DhA.i.270); women who develop the jhānas in this world can be born among the Brahmapārisajjā (see below), but not among the Mahābrahmas (VibhA.437f).  Rebirth in the Brahma world is the result of great virtue accompanied by meditation (Vsm.415).  The Brahmas, like the other celestials, are not necessarily sotāpanna or on the way to complete knowledge (sambodhi-parāyanā); their attainments depend on the degree of their faith in the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha.  See, e.g., A.iv.76f.; it is not necessary to be a follower of the Buddha for one to be born in the Brahma world; the names of six teachers are given whose followers were born in that world as a result of listening to their teaching (A.iii.371ff.; iv.135ff.).  [/p][p]The Jātakas contain numerous accounts of ascetics who practised meditation, being born after death in the Brahma world (e.g., J.ii.43, 69, 90; v.98, etc.).  Some of the Brahmas - e.g., Baka (q.v.) - held false views regarding their world, which, like all other worlds, is subject to change and destruction (M.i.327).  When the rest of the world is destroyed at the end of a kappa, the Brahma world is saved (Vsm.415; KhpA.121), and the first beings to be born on earth come from the Ābhassara Brahma world (Vsm.417).  Buddhas and their more eminent disciples often visit the Brahma worlds and preach to the inhabitants.  E.g., M.i.326 f.; ThagA.ii.184ff.; Sikhī Buddha and Abhibhū are also said to have visited the Brahma world (A.i.227f.).  The Buddha could visit it both in his mind made body and his physical body (S.v.282f.).  [/p][p]If a rock as big as the gable of a house were to be dropped from the lowest Brahma-world it would take four months to reach the earth travelling one hundred thousand leagues a day.  Brahmas subsist on trance, abounding in joy (sappītikajjhāna), this being their sole food.  SA.i.161; food and drinks are offered to Mahābrahmā, and he is invited to partake of these, but not of sacrifices (SA.i.158 f.).  Anāgāmins, who die before attaining arahantship, are reborn in the Suddhāvāsā Brahma-worlds and there pass away entirely (see, e.g., S.i.35, 60, and Compendium v.10).  The beings born in the lowest Brahma world are called Brahma-pārisajjā; their life term is one third of an asankheyya kappa; next to them come the Brahma-purohitā, who live for half an asankheyya kappa; and beyond these are the Mahā Brahmas who live for a whole asankheyya kappa (Compendium, v.6; but see VibhA.519f., where Mahā Brahmās are defined).[/p][p]The term Brahmakāyikā-devā seems to be used as a classs-name for all the inhabitants of the Brahma-worlds (A.i.210; v.76f).  [/p][p]The Mahā Niddesa Commentary (p.109) says that the word includes all the five (?) kinds of Brahmā (sabbe pi pañca vokāra Brahmāno gahitā).  [/p][p]The BuA.p.10 thus defines the word Brahmā: brūhito tehi tehi gunavisesahī ti=Brahmā.  Ayam pana Brahmasaddo Mahā-Brahma-brāhmana-Thathāgata mātāpitu-setthādisu dissati.  [/p][p]The Samantapāsādikā (i.131) speaks of a Mahā Brahmā who was a khināsava, living for sixteen thousand kappas.  When the Buddha, immediately after his birth, looked around and took his steps northward, it was this Brahmā who seized the babe by his finger and assured him that none was greater than he.[/p][p]The names of several Brahmās occur in the books - e.g., [/p][ul][li]Tudu[/li][li]Nārada[/li][li]Ghatikāra[/li][li]Baka[/li][li]Sanankumāra[/li][li]Sahampatī[/li][/ul][p]To these should be added the names of seven Anāgāmīs resident in Avihā and other Brahma worlds [/p][ul][li]Upaka, [/li][li]Phalagandu, [/li][li]Pukkusāti, [/li][li]Bhaddiya, [/li][li]Khandadeva, [/li][li]Bāhuraggi and [/li][li]Pingiya (S.i.35, 60; SA.i.72 etc.).  [/li][/ul][p]Baka speaks of seventy two Brahmās, living, apparently, in his world, as his companions (S.i.142).[/p][p]See also Tissa Brahmā.[/p][p]These are described as Mahā Brahmās.  Mention is also made of Pacceka Brahmās - e.g., Subrahmā and Suddhavāsa (S.i.146f).  [/p][p]Tudu is also sometimes described as a Pacceka Brahmā (e.g., S.i.149).  Of the Pacceka Brahmās, Subrahmā and Suddhavāsa are represented as visiting another Brahmā, who was infatuated with his own power and glory, and as challenging him to the performance of miracles, excelling him therein and converting him to the faith of the Buddha.  Tudu is spoken of as exhorting Kokālika to put his trust in Sāriputta and Moggallāna (Loc.  Cit.)[/p][p]No explanation is given of the term Pacceka Brahmā.  Does it mean Brahmās who dwelt apart, by themselves? Cp.  Pacceka-Buddha.[/p][p]The Brahmās are represented as visiting the earth and taking an interest in the affairs of men.  Thus, Nārada descends from the Brahma-world to dispel the heresies of King Angati (J.vi.242f).  When the Buddha hesitates to preach his doctrine, because of its profundity, it is Sahampati (q.v.) who visits him and begs him to preach it for the welfare of the world.  The explanation given (e.g., at SA.i.155) is that the Buddha waited for the invitation of Sahampati that it might lend weight to his teaching.  The people were followers of Brahmā, and Sahampati's acceptance of the Buddha's leadership would impress them deeply.  [/p][p]Sahampatī is mentioned as visiting the Buddha several times subsequently, illuminating Jetavana with the effulgence of his body.  It is said that with a single finger he could illuminate a whole Cakkavāla (SA.i.158).  Sanankumāra (q.v.) was also a follower of the Buddha.  The Brahmās appear to have been in the habit of visiting the deva worlds too, for Sanankumāra is reported as being present at an assembly of the Tāvatimsa gods and as speaking there the Buddha's praises and giving an exposition of his teaching.  But, in order to do this, he assumed the form of Pañcasikha (D.ii.211ff).[/p][p]The books refer (e.g., at D.i.18, where Brahmā is described as vasavattī issaro kattā nimmātā, etc.) to the view held, at the Buddha's time, of Brahmā as the creator of the universe and of union with Brahmā as the highest good, only to be attained by prayers and sacrifices.  But the Buddha himself did not hold this view amid does not speak of any single Brahmā as the highest being in all creation.  See, however, A.v.59f., where Mahā Brahmā, is spoken of as the highest denizen of the Sahassalokadhātu (yāvatā sahassalokadhātu, Mahā-Brahmā tattha aggam akkhāyati); but he, too, is impermanent (Mahā-Brahmūno pi .  .  .  atthi eva aññathattam, atthi viparināmo).[/p][p]There are Mahā Brahmās, mighty and powerful (abhibhū anabhibhūto aññadatthudaso vasavattī), but they too, all of them, and their world are subject to the laws of Kamma.  E.g., at S.v.410 (Brahmaloko pi āvuso anicco adhuvo sakkāyapariyāpanno sādhāyasmā Brahmalokā cittam vutthāpetvā sakkāyanirodhacittam upasamharāhi).  See also A.iv.76f., 104f., where Sunetta, in spite of all his great powers as Mahā Brahmā, etc., had to confess himself still subject to suffering.  [/p][p]To the Buddha, union with Brahmā seems to have meant being associated with him in his world, and this can only be attained by cultivation of those qualities possessed by the Brahmā.  But the highest good lay beyond, in the attainment of Nibbāna.  Thus in the Tevijjā Sutta; see also M.ii.194f.[/p][p]The word Brahma is often used in compounds meaning highest and best - e.g., Brahmacariyā, Brahmassara; for details see Brahma in the New Pāli Dictionary.[/p][hr]</entry>
  <entry>[div class="huge"]Bandhula[/div][p]Son of a chieftain of the [b]Mallas[/b] in [b]Kusinārā[/b].  He studied at [b]Takkasilā[/b] with [b]Mahāli[/b] and [b]Pasenadi[/b].  On his return home, he wished to give an exhibition of his skill, and the princely families of the Mallas bound sticks of bamboo in bundles of sixty, inserting a strip of iron in each bundle; they then suspended the bundles in the air and challenged Bandhula to cut them down.  He leapt up in the air and smote them with his sword, but on discovering the treachery of his kinsmen, he threatened to kill them all; his parents, however, dissuaded him, and he went to live in Sāvatthi, where Pasenadi appointed him Senāpati.  [/p][p]Bandhula's wife was [b]Mallikā[/b] (known as [b]Bandhula[/b][b]-[/b][b]Mallikā[/b] in order to distinguish her from the wife of Pasenadi).  As she bore no children, Bandhula wished to send her back to her people; but when she went to bid farewell to the Buddha before her departure, he asked her to return to her husband.  He accepted her, thereby showing his faith in the Buddha.  Soon after she conceived a child, and her pregnancy longing was to enter the lotus tank used by the princes of [b]Vesāli[/b] on their coronation and to drink its water.  Bandhula took her to Vesāli, drove away the strong guards who were posted at the lotus tank, and let Mallikā enjoy it to her heart's content.  When the [b]Licchavi[/b] princes heard of this, they were greatly enraged and pursued Bandhula's chariot, in spite of the warning of Mahāli.  When the chariots of the Licchavis came into line, Bandhula, in order to frighten them, twanged his bow; but as they still pursued him, he shot a single arrow, which pierced each of the five hundred Licchavis through his girdle without their being aware of the wound.  Bandhula told them of their plight; but they refused to believe him until they loosed the girdle of the foremost and he fell down dead.  Thereupon they returned to their homes, bade farewell to their families, and fell dead on the moment of loosening their armour.[/p][p]Mallikā bore twin sons sixteen times; each of them became perfect in the various arts, and each had a retinue of one thousand men.  One day, Bandhula retried a case, which had been unjustly decided by the judge and his decision was greatly applauded.  The king, hearing the applause and learning the reason, appointed him judge.  It is probably this incident, which is referred to at S.i.74 ([b]Atthakarana Sutta[/b]); see also KS.i.101, n.3. [/p][p]But the former judges poisoned the king's mind against Bandhula, and the king, listening to them, sent Bandhula and his sons to quell a frontier rebellion, giving orders that they should all be murdered on the way home.  This was done, and the news of the massacre was brought to Mallikā while she was entertaining five hundred monks led by the two Chief Disciples (according to MA.ii.753 the Buddha was also present).  Mallikā read the message, and placing it in a fold of her dress, went on with her duties.  [b]Sāriputta[/b] discovered her fortitude at the end of the meal and greatly praised her.  Mallikā sending for her daughters in law, broke the news to them, urging them to harbour no resentment against the king.  The king's spies, discovering this, brought the news to Pasenadi.  The king was greatly moved, and having sent for Mallikā, begged her forgiveness and granted her a boon.  She chose as her boon that she and her thirty two daughters in law should be allowed to return home to [b]Kusinārā[/b].  Bandhula's nephew, [b]Dīghakārāyāna[/b], was appointed commander-in chief, but he never forgave the injury to Bandhula, and, in the end, brought about Pasenadi's deposition and consequent death (DhA.i.228f., 349 56; J.iv.148 ff.; MA.ii.753f).[/p][p]Bandhula isi sometimes referred to as [b]Bandhulamalla[/b].  (E.g., J.iv.148.) [/p][p]Bandhula's wife, Mallikā, was one of the three persons possessing the [b]Mahālatāpasādhana[/b], the others being [b]Visākhā[/b] and [b]Devadāniyacora[/b] (but see DhA.i.412, where the daughter of Bārānasīsetthi is substituted for Devadāniya).[/p][p]From the time of her husband's death Mallikā laid aside the pasādhana, but, on the day on which the Buddha's body was being removed for cremation, she washed the pasādhana in perfumed water and placed it on the body, which it completely covered.  She expressed the wish that, as long as she remained in samsāra, her body should need no ornament.  DA.ii.597.[/p][hr]</entry>

The Buddha, aware of this, went to the Brahma world and stood in the air enveloped in flame.  [/p][p]He was followed by Moggallāna, Kassapa, Kappina and Anuruddha.  Moggallāna asked the Brahmā if he still held the same view, to which he replied that he no longer thought that he was eternal.  (This shows that the Brahmā of the story was most probably Baka.)

The deity of the tree (Bhaddasāla 2), who was the Bodhisatta, was greatly distressed at the prospect of the destruction of his children.  He, therefore, visited the king by night and begged him not to have the tree cut down.  When the king refused this request, Bhaddasāla asked that the tree should be cut down in pieces, so that in its fall it might not damage its kindred round about.  This feeling of Bhaddasāla for his kinsmen touched the king, and he desisted from his purpose of destroying the tree.[/p][p]The story was related in reference to the Buddha's interference with Vidūdabha (q.v.) when he wished to destroy the Sākyans.[/p][p]Ananda is identified with the king (J.iv.153 7).

He was a crooked little dwarf and, lest he should be refused employment on account of his size, he persuaded a tall, well built weaver, called Bhīmasena, to be his stalking horse.  Bhīmasena went with him to the king of Benares and obtained the post of royal archer.  Once, the kingdom was attacked by a tiger and Bhīmasena was sent to kill it.  Following the advice of the Bodhisatta, he went with a large band of country men, and when the tiger was sighted he waited in a thicket and lay flat on his face.  When he knew that the tiger had been killed, he came out of the thicket trailing a creeper in his hand and blamed the people, saying that he had meant to lead the tiger like an ox to the king and had gone into the wood to find a creeper for that purpose.  "Who has killed the tiger and spoilt all my plans?" he asked.  "I will report all of you to the king." The terrified people bribed him heavily and said no word as to who had killed the tiger.  The king, believing that Bhīmasena himself had killed it, rewarded him handsomely.  The same thing happened with a buffalo.  Bhīmasena grew rich and began to neglect the Bodhisatta.  Soon after, a hostile king marched on Benares.  Bhīmasena went with a large army riding on an elephant, the Bodhisatta behind him, but at the sight of the battlefield Bhīmasena was so terrified that he fouled the elephant's back.  The Bodhisatta taunted him and sent him home, while he himself captured the enemy king and brought him to the king of Benares, who showed him all honour.[/p][p]The story was related in reference to a monk who, although of low family, used to boast of that family's greatness.

  <entry>[div class="huge"]Bodhisatta[/div][p]The name given to a being who aspires to Bodhi or Enlightenment.  The Commentaries (e.g., DA.ii.427) define the word thus: Bodhisatto ti panditasatto bujjhanakasatto; bodhisankhātesu vā catusu maggesu āsatto laggamānaso ti Bodhisatto.  See also AA.i.453. For a discussion of the meaning of the word see Har Dayal: The Bodhisativa Doctrine, pp.4ff.  [/p][p]The word can therefore be used in reference to all those who seek Nibbāna, including Buddhas, Pacceka Buddhas, and the disciples of Buddhas (Buddha-paccekabuddha-buddha-sāvakā), but is commonly used only of those beings who seek to become Buddhas.  The word may have been used originally only in connection with the last life of a Buddha, in such contexts as "in the days before my Enlightenment, when as yet I was only a Bodhisatta”.  E.g., M.i.17, 114, 163; so also in the Mahāpadāna Sutta (D.ii.13) and the Acchariyaabbhutadhamma Sutta (M.iii.119).  [/p][p]But already in the Kathāvatthu (e.g., 283 90, 623) the previous lives of Gotama Buddha and other saints had begun to excite interest and speculation.[/p][p]In the developed form of the ideas regarding Bodhisattas, a Bodhisatta's career started with his making a resolution before a Buddha (abhinīhārakarana or mūlapanidhāna) to become a Buddha for the welfare and liberation of all creatures.  In later literature, the abhinīhāra is preceded by a period during which the Bodhisatta practises manopanidhi, when he resolves in his mind to desire to become a Buddha without declaring this intention to others.[/p][p]For the abhinīhāra to be effective, eight conditions should be fulfilled (Bu.ii.59; explained at BuA.75f.  and SNA.i.48f): the aspirant should be [/p][ul][li](1) a human being, [/li][li](2) a male, [/li][li](3) sufficiently developed to become an arahant in that very birth, [/li][li](4) a recluse at the time of the declaration, [/li][li](5) he should declare his resolve before a Buddha, [/li][li](6) should be possessed of attainments such as the jhānas, [/li][li](7) be prepared to sacrifice all, even life, and [/li][li](8) his resolution should be absolutely firm and unwavering.  [/li][/ul][p]In the case of Gotama Buddha, his abhinīhāra was made at Amaravātī in the presence of Dīpankara Buddha.  His name at that time was Sumedha (q.v.).  The Buddha, before whom the abhinīhāra is made, looks into the future and, if satisfied, declares the fulfilment of the resolve, mentioning the particulars of such fulfilment.  This declaration is called vyākarana, and is made also by all subsequent Buddhas whom the Bodhisatta may meet during his career.  Having received his first vyākarana, the Bodhisatta proceeds to investigate the qualities which should be acquired by him for the purposes of Buddhahood (buddhakārakadhammā), in accordance with the custom of previous Bodhisattas.  These he discovers to be ten in number, the Ten Perfection, (dasapārami):[/p][ul][li]dāna, [/li][li]sīla, [/li][li]nekkhamma, [/li][li]paññā, [/li][li]viriya, [/li][li]khanti, [/li][li]sacca, [/li][li]aditthāna, [/li][li]mettā and [/li][li]upekhā.  [/li][/ul][p]Bu.ii.116ff.  Sometimes thirty pāramī are spoken of, each of the ten being divided into three, varying in kind and degree.  Thus, in the case of [/p][ul][li]dāna, the dānapārami consists in giving one's limbs,[/li][li]dāna upapārami in giving away one's external possessions and [/li][li]dānapāramatthapāramī in giving one's life, this last being the most excellent.  [/li][/ul][p]In the case of Gotama Buddha, examples of births in which the ten pārami were practised to the highest degree are as follows: the Ekarāja, Khantivādī, Cūlla-Sankhapāla, Mahājanaka, Mahāsutasoma, Mūgapakkha, Lomahamsa, Sattubhattaka, Sasa, and Sutasoma Jātakas (BuA.  50; J.i.44f).  [/p][p]He also develops the four Buddhabhūmi (catasso buddhabhūmiyo) - [/p][ul][li]ussāha, [/li][li]ummagga, [/li][li]avatthāna and [/li][li]hitacariyā - [/li][/ul][p]explained respectively as zealousness (viriya), wisdom (paññā), resolution (adhitthāna) and compassion (mettābhāvanā).  [/p][p]He cultivates the six ajjhāsayas which conduce to the maturing of Enlightenment (bodhiparipākiyā samvattanti), these six being: [/p][ul][li]nekkhammajjhāsaya, [/li][li]pavivekajjhāsaya, [/li][li]alobhajjhāsaya, [/li][li]adosajjhāsaya, [/li][li]amohajjhāsaya and [/li][li]nissaravajjhāsaya.  SNA.i.50[/li][/ul][p]A Bodhisatta, during his career, escapes from being born in eighteen inauspicious states (atthārasa abhabbatthānāni).  He is never born blind, deaf, insane, slobbery (elamūga) or crippled, or among savages (milakkkesu), in the womb of a slave, or as a heretic.  He never changes his sex, is never guilty of any of the five ānantarikakammas, and never becomes a leper.  If born as an animal, he never becomes less than a quail or more than an elephant.  He is never born either among various classes of petas nor among the Kālakañjakas, neither in Avīci nor in the lokantaraka nirayas, neither as Māra, nor in worlds where there is no perception (asaññibhava), nor in the Suddhāvāsas, nor in the Arūpa worlds, nor ever in another Cakkavāla.  SNA.i.50 f.[/p][p]Besides practising the (thirty) pārami, all Bodhisattas must make the five great sacrifices (mahāpariccāgā) - giving up [/p][ul][li]wife, [/li][li]children, [/li][li]kingdom, [/li][li]life and [/li][li]limb (J.vi.552) [/li][/ul][p]and must fulfil the three kinds of conduct (cariyā) [/p][ul][li]ñātatthacariyā, [/li][li]lokatthacariyā and [/li][li]buddhiatthacariyā [/li][/ul][p]and the seven mahādanas as practised by Vessantara, which caused the earth to quake seven times.  DA.ii.427; DhA.iii.441; the BuA.  (116 f.) gives a story about Mangala Buddha which corresponds to that of Vessantara in regard to Gotama Buddha.  See Kharadāthika.[/p][p]The length of a Bodhisatta's career varies; some practice the pāramī for at least four asankheyyas and one hundred thousand kappas, others for at least eight asankheyyas and one hundred thousand kappas, and yet others for sixteen asankheyyas and one hundred thousand kappas.  The first of these periods is the very least that is required and is intended for those who excel in wisdom (paññā).  The middle is for those who excel in faith (saddhā); and the last and highest for those whose chief feature is perseverance (viriya) (SNA.i.47 f).[/p][p]In their penultimate life all Bodhisattas are born in Tusita (see Buddha), where life lasts for fifty seven crores and six million years, but most Bodhisattas leave Tusita before completing their life span.  Vipassī, e.g., was among the exceptions (DA.ii.427).[/p][p]As the time for the announcement of their last birth approaches, all is excitement because of various signs appearing in the ten thousand world systems.  The devas of all the worlds assemble in Tusita and request the Bodhisatta to seek birth as a human being, that he may become the Buddha.  The Bodhisatta withholds his reply until he has made the Five Great Investigations (pañcamahāvilokanā) regarding time, continent, place of birth, his mother and the life span left to her.  Buddhas do not appear in the world when men live to more than one hundred thousand years or to less than one hundred.  They are born only in Jambudīpa and in the Majjhimadesa, and only of a khattiya or brahmin clan.  The Bodhisatta's mother in his last birth must not be passionate or given to drink; she should have practised the pārami for one hundred thousand kappas, have kept the precepts inviolate from birth, and should not be destined to live more than ten months and seven days after the conception of the Bodhisatta.[/p][p]Having satisfied himself as to these particulars, the Bodhisatta goes with the other devas to Nandanavana in Tusita, where he announces his departure from their midst and disappears from among them while playing.  On the day of his conception, the Bodhisatta's mother takes the vows of fasting and celibacy at the conclusion of a great festival, and when she has retired to rest, she dreams that the Four Regent Gods take her with her bed, bathe her in the Anotatta Lake, clad her in divine garments, and place her in a golden palace surrounded by all kinds of luxury.  As she lies there the Bodhisatta in the form of a white elephant enters her womb through her right side.  The earth trembles and all the ten thousand world systems are filled with radiance.  Immediately the Four Regent Gods assume guard over mother and child.  Throughout the period of pregnancy, which lasts for ten months; exactly, the mother remains free from ailment and sees the child in her womb sitting crossed legged (like a preacher on a dais, says the Commentary DA.ii.436).  At the end of the ten months; she gives birth to the child, standing in a grove, never indoors.  Suddhāvāsa brahmins, free from all passion, first receive the child in a golden net, and from them the Four Regent Gods take him on an antelope skin and present him to his mother.  Though the Bodhisatta is born free of the mucous otherwise present at birth, two showers of water - one hot, the other cold - fall from the sky and bathe mother and child.  The child then takes seven strides to the north, standing firmly on his feet, looks on all sides, and seeing no one anywhere to equal him, announces his supremacy over the whole world and the fact that this is his last birth.  (Gotama Buddha as the Bodhisatta, spoke, in three different births, as soon as born - as Mahosadha, as Vessantara, and in his last birth, J.i.53).  [/p][p]Seven days after birth his mother dies.  She dies because she must bear no other being.  The Bodhisatta's time of conception is so calculated that the mother's destined life span completes itself seven days after his birth.  From the Commentary (DA.ii.437; UdA.278) account it would appear that the age of the Bodhisatta's mother at the time of his birth is between fifty and sixty (majjhimavayassa pana dve kotthāsā atikkamma tatiyekotthāse).[/p][p]The Bodhisatta's last birth is attended by various miracles.  The Commentaries see, in the various incidents connected with the Bodhisatta's last birth, signs of various features, which came, later, to be associated with the Buddha and his doctrine; for details see DA.ii.439ff.  [/p][p]Soothsayers, being summoned, see on the child's body the thirty two marks of a Great Man (mahāpurisa), (for details of these see D.ii.17ff.; M.ii.136f.  The reasons for these marks are given at D.iii.145ff ) and declare that the child will become either a Cakkavatti or a Buddha.  His father, desiring that his child shall be a Cakkavatti rather than a Buddha, brings him up in great luxury, hiding from him all the sin and ugliness of the world.  But the destiny of a Bodhisatta asserts itself, and he becomes aware of the presence in the world of old age, disease, death and the freedom of mind to be found in the life of a Recluse.  In the case of some Bodhisattas (e.g., Vipassī) these four signs (nimittāni as they are called) are seen by them at different times, but in the case of others on one and the same day (DA.ii.457).[/p][p]Urged by the desire to discover the cause of suffering in the world and the way out of it, the Bodhisatta leaves the world on the day of his son's birth.  [/p][ul][li]Some Bodhisattas leave the world riding on an elephant (e.g., Dīpankara, Sumana, Sumedha, Phustsa, Sikhī and Konāgamana), [/li][li]some on a chariot (e.g., Kondañña, Revata, Paduma, Piyadassī, and Kakusandha), [/li][li]some on a horse (e.g., Mangala, Sujāta, Atthadassī, Tissa, Gotama), and [/li][li]some in a palanquin (e.g., Anomadassī, Siddhattha and Vessabhū).  [/li][li]Some, like Nārada, go on foot, [/li][li]while Sobhita, Dhammadassī and Kassapa travelled in the palaces of their lay life.[/li][/ul][p]Having left the world, the Bodhisatta practises the austerities, the period of such practices varying.  [/p][ul][li]In the case of Dīpankara, Kondañña, Sumana, Anomadassī, Sujāta, Siddhattha and Kakusandha it was ten months; [/li][li]for Mangala, Sumedha, Tissa and Sikhī it was eight; [/li][li]for Revata seven; [/li][li]for Piyadassī, Phussa, Vessabhū and Konāgamana six; [/li][li]for Sobhita four; [/li][li]for Paduma, Atthadassī and Vipassī two weeks; [/li][li]for Nārada, Padumuttara, Dhammadassī and Kassapa one week; [/li][li]and for Gotama six years (for the reason for this great length in the last case, see Gotama).  [/li][/ul][p]On the day the Bodhisatta attains to Buddhahood, he receives a meal of milk rice (pāyāsa) from a woman and a gift of kusagrass, generally from an Ājīvīka, which he spreads under the Bodhi-tree (the Bodhi tree is different for each Bodhisatta) for his seat.  The size of this seat varies;[/p][ul][li]the seats of Dīpankara, Revata, Piyadassī, Atthadassī, Dhammadassī and Vipassī were fifty-three hands in length; [/li][li]those of Kondañña, Mangala, Nārada and Sumedha fifty seven hands; [/li][li]that of Sumana sixty hands; [/li][li]those of Sobhita, Anomadassī, Paduma, Padumuttara and Phussa thirty eight; [/li][li]of Sujāta thirty two; [/li][li]of Kakusandha twenty six; [/li][li]of Konāgamana twenty; [/li][li]of Kassapa fifteen; [/li][li]of Gotama fourteen (BuA.  247).  [/li][/ul][p]Before the Enlightenment the Bodhisatta has five great dreams: [/p][ul][li](1) that the world is his couch with the Himālaya as his pillow, his left hand resting on the eastern sea, his right on the western, and his feet on the southern; [/li][li](2) that a blade of tiriyā(kusa) grass growing from his navel touches the clouds; [/li][li](3) that white worms with black heads creep up from his feet, covering his knees; [/li][li](4) that four birds of varied hues from the four quarters of the world fall at his feet and become white; [/li][li](5) that he walks to and fro on a heap of dung, by which he remains unsoiled.  [/li][/ul][p]For the explanations of these dreams see A.iii.240f.; these dreams are referred to at J.i.69.[/p][p]The next day the Bodhisatta sits cross legged on his seat facing the east, determined not to rise till he has attained his goal.  The gods of all the worlds assemble to do him honour, but Māra (q.v.) comes with his mighty hosts and the gods flee.  All day, the fight continues between Māra and the Bodhisatta; the pārami alone are present to lend their aid to the Bodhisatta, and when the moment comes, the Goddess of the Earth bears witness to his great sacrifices, while Māra and his armies retire discomfited at the hour of sunset, the gods then returning and singing a paean of victory.  Meanwhile the Bodhisatta spends the night in deep concentration; during the first watch he requires knowledge of past lives, during the second watch he develops the divine eye, while during the last watch he ponders over and comprehends the Paticca-samuppāda doctrine.  Backwards and forwards his mind travels over the chain of causation and twelve times the earth trembles.  With sunrise, omniscience dawns on him, and he becomes the Supremely Awakened Buddha, uttering his udānā of victory, while the whole world rejoices with him.  [/p][p]For the Paticca-Samuppada see D.ii.31ff.; for the other details see J.i.56ff., where the story of Gotama is given.  DA.ii.462ff gives similar details regarding Vipassī; BuA.248 says it is the same for all Bodhisattas.[/p][p][/p][p]The above is a brief account, as given in the books, of certain features common to all Bodhisattas.  In addition to these, particulars of the personal career of the Bodhisatta who became Gotama, are found, chiefly in the Buddhavamsa and the Jātakatthakathā.  It has already been stated that each Bodhisatta receives the vyākarana from every Buddha whom he meets, and Gotama was no exception.  [/p][ul][li]He received his first vyākarana as the ascetic Sumedha, from Dīpankara; [/li][li]and then, as a cakkavatti, from Kondañña; [/li][li]as the brahmin Suruci, from Mangala; [/li][li]as the Nāga king Atula, from Sumana; [/li][li]as the brahmin Atideva, from Revata; [/li][li]as the brahmin Ajita, from Sobhita; [/li][li]as a yakkha chief, from Anomadassī; [/li][li]as a lion, from Paduma; [/li][li]as an ascetic (isi) from Nārada; [/li][li]as a governor (Mahāratthiya) Jatila, from Padumuttara; [/li][li]as the youth Uttara, from Sumedha; [/li][li]as a Cakkavatti, from Sujāta; [/li][li]as the youth Kassapa, from Piyadassī; [/li][li]as the ascetic Susīma, from Atthadassī; [/li][li]as Sakka, from Dhammadassī; [/li][li]as the ascetic Mangala, from Siddhattha; [/li][li]as Sujāta, from Tissa; [/li][li]as King Vijitāvī, from Phussa; [/li][li]as the Nāga king Atula, from Vipassī; [/li][li]as King Arindama, from Sikhī; [/li][li]as King Sudassana, from Vessabhū; [/li][li]as King Khema, from Kakusandha; [/li][li]as King Pabbata, from Konāgamana; [/li][li]and as the youth Jotipāla, from Kassapa.[/li][/ul][p]The Jātakatthakathā gives particulars of other births of the Bodhisatta (to the births given below and taken from the Jātakatthakathā should be added those given in the Pubbapilotikhanda of the Apadāna i.299ff.; also UdA, and given Gotama ) e.g., as [/p][ul][li]Akitti, [/li][li]Ajjuna, [/li][li]Atthisena, [/li][li]Anitthigandha, [/li][li]Ayoghara, [/li][li]Araka, [/li][li]Arindama, [/li][li]Alīnacitta, [/li][li]Alīnasattu, [/li][li]Asadisa, [/li][li]Ādāsamukha, [/li][li]Udaya, [/li][li]Udayabhadda, [/li][li]Katthavāhana, [/li][li]Kanhadīpāyana, [/li][li]Kanhapandita, [/li][li]Kapila, [/li][li]Kappa, [/li][li]Kassapa, [/li][li]Kārandiya, [/li][li]Kālingabhāradvāja, [/li][li]Kunāla, [/li][li]Kundakumāra, [/li][li]Kuddālaka, [/li][li]Kusa, [/li][li]Komāyaputta, [/li][li]Khadiravaniya, [/li][li]Guttila, [/li][li]Ghata, [/li][li]Canda, [/li][li]Candakumāra, [/li][li]Campeyya, [/li][li]Cittapandita, [/li][li]Cullaka setthi, [/li][li]Culladhanuggaha, [/li][li]Chaddanta, [/li][li]Chalangakumāra, [/li][li]Janasandha.

The [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/anaagatavamsa,Anāgatavamsa')"]Anāgatavamsa[/a] gives a detailed account of him.  Some MSS.  of that poem (J.P.T.S.  1886, p.  37) mention the names of ten future Buddhas, all of whom met Gotama who prophesied about them.  These are Metteyya, Uttama, Rāma, Pasenadi Kosala, Abhibhū, Dīghasonī, Sankacca, Subha, Todeyya, Nālāgiripalaleyya (sic).

The Commentary (DA.ii.422ff) adds to these other particulars - the names of his son and his wife before his Renunciation, the conveyance (yāna) in which he leaves the world, the monastery in which his Gandhakuti was placed, the amount of money paid for its purchase, the site of the monastery, and the name of his chief lay patron.  In the case of Gotama, the further fact is stated that on the day of his birth there appeared also in the world Rāhulamātā, Ananda, Kanthaka, Nidhikumbhi (Treasure Trove), the Mahābodhi and Kāludāyī.  Gotama was conceived under the asterism (nakkhatta) of Uttarāsālha, under which asterism he also made his Renunciation (Da.ii425), preached his first sermon and performed the Twin Miracle.  Under the asterism of  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/visaakha,Visākha')"]Visākha[/a] he was born, attained Enlightenment and died; under that of  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/maagha,Māgha')"]Māgha[/a] he held his first assembly of arahants and decided to die; under Assayuja he descended from Tāvatimsa.[/p][p]The Buddhavamsa Commentary says (BuA.2f) that in the Buddhavamsa particulars of each Buddha are given under twenty two heads, the additional heads being the details of the first sermon, the numbers of those attaining realization of truth (abhisamaya) at each assembly, the names of the two chief women disciples, the aura of the Buddha's body (ramsi), the height of his body, the name of the Bodhisatta (who was to become Gotama Buddha), the prophecy concerning him, his exertions (padhāna) and the details of each Buddha's death.  The Commentary also says that mention must be made of the time each Buddha lived as a householder, the names of the palaces he occupied, the number of his dancing women, the names of his chief wife, and his son, his conveyance, his renunciation, his practice of austerities, his patrons and his monastery.[/p][p]There are eight particulars in which the Buddhas differ from each other (atthavemattāni).  These are length of life in the epoch in which each is born, the height of his body, his social rank (some are born as khattiyas, others as brahmins), the length of his austerities, the aura of his body (thus, in the case of Mangala, his aura spread throughout the ten thousand world systems, while that of Gotama extended only one fathom; - but when he wishes, a Buddha can spread his aura at will, BuA.106); the conveyance in which he makes his renunciation, the tree under which he attains Enlightenment, and the size of the seat (pallanka) under the Bodhi tree.  [/p][p]Only the first five are mentioned in DA.ii.424; also at BuA.105; all eight are given at BuA.246f., which also gives details under each of the eight heads, regarding all the twenty five Buddhas.[/p][p]In the case of all Buddhas, there are four fixed spots (avijahitatthānāni).  These are: [/p][ul][li]the site of the seat under the Bodhi tree (bodhipallanka), [/li][li]the Deer Park at  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/i_/isipatana,Isipatana')"]Isipatana[/a] where the first sermon is preached, [/li][li]the spot where the Buddha first steps on the ground at Sankassa on his descent from Tusita (Tāvatimsa?)[/li][li]the spots marked by the four posts of the bed in the Buddha's  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/g/gandhakuti,Gandhakuti')"]Gandhakuti[/a] in Jetavana.

[/li][/ul][p]There are also mentioned four dangers from which all Buddhas are immune: [/p][ul][li]no misfortune can befall the four requisites intended for a Buddha; [/li][li]no one can encompass his death; [/li][li]no injury can befall any of his thirty two  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahapurisa,Mahāpurisalakkhanā')"]Mahāpurisalakkhanā[/a] or eighty anubyañjanā; [/li][li]nothing can obstruct his aura (BuA.248).  [/li][/ul][p]A Buddha is born only in this Cakkavāla out of the ten thousand Cakkavālas which constitute the jātikkhetta (AA.i.251; DA.iii.897).  There can appear only one Buddha in the world at a time (D.ii.225; D.iii.114; the reasons for this are given in detail in Mil.  236, and quoted in DA.iii.900f).  No Buddha can arise until the sāsana of the previous Buddha has completely disappeared from the world.  This happens only with the dhātuparinibbāna (see below).  When a Bodhisatta takes conception in his mother's womb in his last life, after leaving Tusita, there is manifested throughout the world a wonderful radiance, and the ten thousand world systems tremble.[/p][p]Similar earthquakes appear when he is born, when he attains Enlightenment, when he preaches the first sermon, when he decides to die, when he finally does so (D.ii.108f.; cp.  DA.iii.897).[/p][p]The  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahapadana_s,Mahāpādāna Sutta')"]Mahāpādāna Sutta[/a] (D.ii.12-15) and the [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/am/acchariyabbhuta_s,Acchariya-bbhuta-dhamma Sutta')"]Acchariya-bbhuta-dhamma Sutta[/a] (M.iii.119-124) contain accounts of other miracles, which attend the conception and birth of a Buddha.  Later books (e.g., J.i.) have greatly enlarged these accounts.  They describe how the Bodhisatta, having practised the thirty Pāramī, and made the five great gifts (pañcamahāpariccāgā), and thus reached the pinnacle of the threefold cariyā - ñātattha-cariyā, lokattha-cariyā and buddhi-cariyā - gives the seven mahādānā, as in the case of  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/vessantara,Vessantara')"]Vessantara[/a], making the earth tremble seven times, and is born after death in Tusita.  The Bodhisatta, who later became Vipassī Buddha, remained in Tusita during the whole permissible period - fifty seven crores and sixty seven thousand years.  But most Bodhisattas leave Tusita before completing the full span of life there.  Five signs appear to warn the devaputta that his end is near (see Deva); the gods of the ten thousand worlds gather round him, beseeching him to be born on earth that he may become the Buddha.  The Bodhisatta thereupon makes the five investigations (pañcamahāvilokanāni).[/p][p]Sometimes only one Buddha is born in a  [a href="http://www.palikanon.com/english/wtb/g_m/kappa,kappa')"]kappa[/a], such a kappa being called Sārakappa; sometimes two, Mandakappa; sometimes three, Varakappa; sometimes four, Sāramandakappa; rarely five, Bhaddakappa (BuA.158f).  No Buddha is born in the early period of a kappa, when men live longer than one hundred thousand years and are thus not able to recognize the nature of old age and death, and therefore not able to benefit by his preaching.  When the life of man is too short, there is no time for exhortation and men are full of  [a href="http://www.palikanon.com/english/wtb/g_m/kilesa,kilesa')"]kilesa[/a].  The suitable age for a Buddha is, therefore, when men live not less than one hundred years and not more than ten thousand.  The Bodhisatta must first consider the continent and the country of birth.  Buddhas are born only in  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/j/jambudiipa,Jambudīpa')"]Jambudīpa[/a], and there, too, only in the  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/majjhimadesa,Majjhimadesa')"]Majjhimadesa[/a].  He must then consider the family; Buddhas are born only in brahmin or khattiya families, whichever is more esteemed during that particular age.  Then he must think of the mother: she must be wise and virtuous; and her life must be destined to end seven days after the Buddha's birth.[/p][p]Having made these decisions, the Bodhisatta goes to  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/n/nandanavana,Nandanavana')"]Nandanavana[/a] in Tusita, and while wandering about there "falls away" from Tusita and takes conception.  He is aware of his death but unaware of his cuti-citta or dying thought.  The Commentators seem to have differed as to whether there is awareness of conception.  When the Bodhisatta is conceived, his mother has no further wish for indulgence in sexual pleasure.  For seven days previously she observes the uposatha vows, but there is no mention of a virgin birth; the birth might be called parthenogenetic (see Mil.123).[/p][p]On the day of the actual conception, the mother, having bathed in scented water after the celebration of the Asālha festival, and having eaten choice food, takes upon herself the  [a href="http://www.palikanon.com/english/wtb/u_v/uposatha,uposatha')"]uposatha[/a] vows and retires to the adorned state bedchamber.  As she sleeps, she dreams that the  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/caatummahaaraajikaa,Four Regent Gods')"]Four Regent Gods[/a] raise her with her bed, and, having taken her to the Himālaya, bathe her in Lake Anotatta, robe her in divine clothes, anoint her with perfumes and deck her with heavenly flowers (according to the Nidānakathā, J.i.50, it is their queens who do these things, re the Bodhisatta assuming the form of an elephant, see Dial.ii.116n).  Not far away is a silver mountain and on it a golden mansion.  There they lay her with her head to the east.  The Bodhisatta, assuming the form of a white elephant, enters her room, and after circling right wise three times round her bed, smites her right side with his trunk and enters her womb.  She awakes and tells her husband of her dream.  Soothsayers are consulted, and they prophesy the birth of a  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/cakkavatti,Cakka-vatti')"]Cakka-vatti[/a] or of a Buddha.[/p][p]The two suttas mentioned above speak of the circumstances obtaining during the time spent by the child in his mother's womb.  It is said (DA.ii.437) that the Bodhisatta is born when his mother is in the last third of her middle age.  This is in order that the birth may be easy for both mother and child.  Various miracles attend the birth of the Bodhisatta.  The Commentaries expound, at great length, the accounts of these miracles given in the suttas.  Immediately after birth the Bodhisatta stands firmly on his feet, and having taken seven strides to the north, while a white canopy, is held over his head, looks round and utters in fearless voice the lion's roar: "Aggo 'ham asmi lokassa, jettho 'ham asmi lokassa, settho 'ham asmi lokassa, ayam antimā jāti, natthi dāni punabbhavo” (D.ii.15).  [/p][p]To the later Buddhists, not only these acts of the Bodhisatta, but every item of the miracles accompanying his birth, have their symbolical meaning.  See, e.g., DA.ii.439; thus, standing on the earth means the attaining of the four iddhi-pādas; facing north implies the spiritual conquest of multitudes; the seven strides are the seven bojjhangas; the canopy is the umbrella of emancipation; looking round means unveiled knowledge; fearlessness denotes the irrevocable turning of the Wheel of the Law; the mention of the last birth, the arahantship he will attain in this life, etc.[/p][p]There seems to have been a difference of opinion among the Elders of the Sangha as to what happened when the Bodhisatta took his seven strides northwards.  Did he walk on the earth or travel through the air? Did people see him go? Was he clothed? Did he look an infant or an adult? Tipitaka Culābhaya, preaching on the first floor of the Lohapāsāda, settled the question by suggesting a compromise: the Bodhisatta walked on earth, but the onlookers felt he was traveling through the air; he was naked, but the onlookers felt he was gaily adorned; he was an infant, but looked sixteen years old; and after his roar he reverted to infancy! (DA.ii.442)[/p][p]After birth, the Bodhisatta is presented to the soothsayers for their prognostications and they reassert that two courses alone are open to him either to be a Cakka-vatti or a Buddha.  They also discover on his body the thirty two marks of the Great Man ( [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahapurisa,Mahāpurisa')"]Mahāpurisa[/a]) (These are given at D.ii.17 19; also M.ii.136f).  The Bodhisatta has also the eighty secondary signs (asīti anubyañjana) such as copper coloured nails glossy and prominent, sinews which are hidden and without knots, etc.  (The list is found in Lal.  121 [106]).  The Brahmāyu Sutta (for details see M.ii.137f) gives other particulars about Gotama, which are evidently characteristic of all Buddhas.  Thus, in walking he always starts with the right foot, his steps are neither too long nor too short, only his lower limbs move; when he gazes on anything, he turns right round to do so (nāgavilokana).  When entering a house he never bends his body (Cp.  DhA.ii.136); when sitting down, accepting water to wash his bowl, eating, washing his hands after eating, or returning thanks, he sits with the greatest propriety, dignity and thoroughness.  When preaching, he neither flatters nor denounces his hearers but merely instructs them, rousing, enlightening and heartening them (M.ii.139).  His voice possesses eight qualities: it is frank, clear, melodious, pleasant, full, carrying, deep and resonant; it does not travel beyond his audience (for details concerning his voice see DA.ii.452f.; and MA.ii.771f).  A passage in the Anguttara (A.iv.308) says that a Buddha preaches in the eight assemblies - of nobles, brahmins, householders, recluses, devas of the  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/caatummahaaraajikaa,Cātummahārājika')"]Cātummahārājika[/a] world, and of  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/t/taavatimsa,Tāvatimsa')"]Tāvatimsa[/a], of Māras and of Brahmās.  In these assemblies he becomes one of them and their language becomes his.[/p][p]The typical career of a Buddha is illustrated in the life of  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/g/gotama,Gotama')"]Gotama[/a].  He renounces the world only after the birth of a son.  This, the Commentary explains (DA.ii.422), is to prevent him from being taken for other than a human being.  He sees the four omens before his Renunciation: an old man, a sick man, a dead man, and a recluse.  Some Buddhas see all four on the same day, others, like  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/vipassii,Vipassī')"]Vipassī[/a], at long intervals (DA.ii.457).  On the night before the Enlightenment, the Bodhisatta dreams five dreams (A.iii.240).  After the Enlightenment the Buddha does not preach till asked to do so by Mahā  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/brahmaloka,Brahmā')"]Brahmā[/a].  This is on order that the world may pay greater attention to the Buddha and his teaching (DA.ii.467).  A Buddha generally travels from the Bodhi tree to  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/i_/isipatana,Isipatana')"]Isipatana[/a] for his first sermon, through the air, but Gotama went on foot because he wished to meet  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/upaka,Upaka')"]Upaka[/a] on the way (DA.ii.471).[/p][p]The Buddha's day is divided into periods, each of which has its distinct duties (DA.i.45f; SNA.i.131f, etc.).  He rises early, and having attended to his bodily functions, sits in solitude till the time arrives for the alms round.  He then puts on his outer robe and goes for alms, sometimes alone, sometimes with a large following of monks.  When he wishes to go alone he keeps the door of his cell shut, which sign is understood by the monks (Ibid., 271).  Occasionally he goes long distances for alms, travelling through the air, and then only khīnāsavā are allowed to accompany him (ThagA.i.65).  Sometimes he goes in the ordinary way (pakatiyā), sometimes accompanied by many miracles.  After the meal he returns to his cell; this is the pure bhattakicca.[/p][p]Having washed his feet, he would emerge from his cell, talk to the monks and admonish them.  To those who ask for subjects of meditation, he would give them according to their temperament.  He would then retire to his cell and, if he so desire, sleep for a while.  After that, he looks around the world with his divine eye, seeking whom he may serve, and would then preach to those who come to him for instruction.  In the evening he would bathe, and then, during the first watch, attend to monks seeking his advice.  The middle watch is spent with devas and others who visit him to question him.  The last watch is divided into three parts: the first part is spent in walking about for exercise and meditation; the second is devoted to sleep; and the third to contemplation, during which those who are capable of benefiting by the Buddha's teaching, through good deeds done by them in the past, come into his vision.  Only beings that are veneyyā (capable of benefiting by instruction) and who possess upanissaya, appear before the Buddha's divine eye (DA.ii.470).  [/p][p]The Buddha gives his visitors permission to ask what they will.  This is called Sabbaññupavārana, and only a Buddha is capable of holding to this promise to answer any question (SNA.i.229).  Except during the rains, the Buddha spends his time in wandering from place to place, gladdening men and inciting them to lead the good life.  This wandering is called cārikā and is of two kinds - turita and aturita.  The first is used for a long journey accomplished by him in a very short time, for the benefit of some particular person.  Thus Gotama travelled three gāvutas to meet  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/maha_kassapa_th,Mahā Kassapa')"]Mahā Kassapa[/a], thirty yojanas to see  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/aa/aalavaka,Alavaka')"]Alavaka[/a] and  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/angulimaala,Angulimāla')"]Angulimāla[/a], forty five yojanas to see  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pu/pukkusati,Pukusāti')"]Pukusāti[/a], etc.  In the case of aturita cārikā progress is slow.  The range of a Buddha's cārikā varies from year to year.  Sometimes he would tour the Mahāmandala of nine hundred yojanas, sometimes the Majjhimamandala of nine hundred yojanas, sometimes only the Antomandala of six hundred yojanas.  A tour of the Mahāmandala occupies nine months, that of the Majjhimamandala eight, and that of the Antomandala from one to four months.  Details of the cārikā and the reasons for them are given at length in DA.i.240 3. When the Buddha cannot go on a journey himself, he sends his chief disciples (SNA.ii.474).  The Buddha announces his intention of undertaking a journey two weeks before he starts, so that the monks may get ready (DhA.ii.167).[/p][p]The Buddha is omniscient, not in the sense that he knows everything, but that he could know anything should he so desire (see MNid.178,179; see also MNidA.223; SNA.i.18.).  His ñāña is one of the four illimitables (neither can the Buddha's body be measured for purposes of comparison with other bodies, MA.ii.790).  He converts people in one of three ways: [/p][ul][li]by exhibition of miraculous powers (iddhipātihāriya), [/li][li]by reading their thoughts (ādesanāpātihāriya), [/li][li]or teaching them what is beneficial to them according to their character and temperament (anusāsanīpātihāriya).  [/li][/ul][p]It is the last method, which the Buddha most often uses (BuA.81) The Buddha's rivals say that he possesses the power of fascination (āvattanīmāyā); but this is untrue, as sometimes (e.g., in the case of the  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kosambii,Kosambi')"]Kosambi[/a] monks) he cannot make even his own disciples obey him.  Some beings, however, can be converted only by a Buddha.  They are called buddha veneyyā (SNA.i.331).  Some are pleased by the Buddha's looks, others by his voice and words, yet others by his austerities, such as the wearing of simple robes, etc.; and finally, those whose standard of judgment is goodness, reflect that he is without a peer (DhA.iii.113f.).  [/p][p]Though the Buddha's teaching is never really lost on the listener, he sometimes preaches knowing that it will be of no immediate benefit (see, e.g.,  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/udumbarika_s,Udumbarikasīhanāda Sutta')"]Udumbarikasīhanāda Sutta[/a], D.iii.57).  It is said that wherever a monk dwells during the Buddha's time, in the vicinity of the Buddha, he would always have ready a special seat for the Buddha because it is possible that the Buddha would pay him a special visit (DA.i.48).  Sometimes the Buddha will send a ray of light from his  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/g/gandhakuti,Gandhakuti')"]Gandhakuti[/a] to encourage a monk engaged in meditation and, appearing before him in this ray of light, preach to him.  Stanzas so preached are called obhāsagāthā (SNA.i.16, 265).[/p][p]Every Buddha founds an Order; the first pātimokkhuddesagāthā of every Buddha is the same (DA.ii.479).  The attainment of arahantship is always the aim of the Buddha's instruction (DA.iii.732).  Beings can obtain the four abhiññā only during the lifetime of a Buddha (AA.i.204).  A Buddha has ten powers (balāni) which consist of his perfect comprehension in ten fields of knowledge, [/p][p]A.v.32f.; M.i.69, etc.  At S.ii.27f., ten similar powers are given as consisting of his knowledge of the  [a href="http://www.palikanon.com/english/wtb/n_r/paticca_samuppaada,Paticasamuppāda')"]Paticasamuppāda[/a].  The powers of a disciple are distinct from those of a Buddha (Kvu.228); they are seven (see, e.g., D.iii.283) and physical strength equal to that of one hundred thousand crores of elephants (BuA.37).  He alone can digest the food of the devas or food which contains the ojā put into it by the devas.  No one else can eat with impunity the food which has been set apart for the Buddha (SNA.i.154).  Besides these excellences, a Buddha possesses the four assurances (vesārajjāni, given at M.i.71f)), the eighteen āvenikadhammā*, and the sixteen anuttariyas**.  [/p][blockquote][p]*Described at Lal.  183, 343, Buddhaghosa also gives (at DA.iii.994) a list of eighteen buddhadhammā, but they are all concerned with the absence of duccarita in the case of the Buddha.[/p][p]**Given by Sāriputta in the  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sampasadaniya_s,Sampasādāniya Sutta')"]Sampasādāniya Sutta[/a] (D.iii.102ff.).[/p][/blockquote][p]The remembrance of former births a Buddha shares with six classes of purified beings, only in a higher degree.  This faculty is possessed in ascending scale by titthiyā, pakatisāvakā, mahāsāvakā, aggasāvakā, pacceka buddhā and buddhā (E.g.,Vsm.411).[/p][p]Every Buddha holds a  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/maha_samaya_s,Mahāsamaya')"]Mahāsamaya[/a], and only a Buddha is capable of preaching a series of suttas to suit the different temperaments of the mighty assembly gathered there (D.ii.255; DA.ii.682f).[/p][p]A Buddha is not completely immune from disease (e.g.,  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/g/gotama,Gotama')"]Gotama[/a]).  Every Buddha has the power of living for one whole kappa," but no Buddha does so, his term of life being shortened by reason of climate and the food he takes (DA.ii.413).  [/p][p]The Commentary explains (DA.ii.554f.) that kappa here means āyukappa, the full span of a man's life during that particular age.  Some, like Mahāsīva Thera, maintained that if the Buddha could live for ten months, overcoming the pains of death, he could as well continue to live to the end of this Bhaddakappa.  But a Buddha does not do so because he wishes to die before his body is overcome by the infirmities of old age.[/p][p]No Buddha, however, dies till the  [a href="http://www.palikanon.com/english/wtb/s_t/saasana,sāsana')"]sāsana[/a] is firmly established (D.iii.122).  There are three parinibbānā in the case of a Buddha: kilesa parinibbāna, khandha parinibbāna and dhātu parinibbāna.  The first takes place under the Bodhi tree, the second at the moment of the Buddha's death, the third long after (DA.iii.899f.; for the history of Gotama's relics see  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/g/gotama,Gotama')"]Gotama[/a]).  Some Buddhas live longer than others; those that are dighāyuka have only sammukhasāvakā (disciples who hear the Doctrine from the Buddha himself), and at their death their relics are not scattered, only a single thūpa being erected over them (SNA.  194, 195).  Short lived Buddhas hold the  [a href="http://www.palikanon.com/english/wtb/u_v/uposatha,uposatha')"]uposatha[/a] once a fortnight; others (e.g.   [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kassapa,Kassapa')"]Kassapa[/a] Buddha) may have it once in six months; yet others (e.g.   [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/vipassii,Vipassī')"]Vipassī[/a]) only once in six years (ThagA.i.62).  [/p][p]After the Buddha's death, his Doctrine is gradually forgotten.  The first Pitaka to be lost is the Abhidhamma, beginning with the Patthāna and ending with the Dhammasangani.  Then, the Anguttara Nikāya of the Sutta Pitaka, from the eleventh to the first Nipāta; next the Samyutta Nikāya from the Cakkapeyyāla to the Oghatarana; then the Majjhima, from the Indriyabhāvanā Sutta to the Mūlapariyāya Sutta, and then the Dīgha, from the Dasuttara to the Brahmajāla.  Scattered gāthā like the Sabhiyapucchā, and the Ālavakapucchā, last much longer, but they cannot maintain the sāsana.  The last Pitaka to disappear is the Vinaya, the last portion being the mātikā of the Ubhatovibhanga (VibhA.432).[/p][p]When a Buddha dies, his body receives the honours due to a monarch (these are detailed at D.ii.141f).  It is said that on the night on which a Buddha attains Enlightenment, and on the night during which he dies, the colour of his skin becomes exceedingly bright (D.ii.134).  Here we have the beginning of a legend which later grew into an account of an actual "transfiguration" of the Buddha.[/p][p]At all times, where a Buddha is present, no other light can shine (SNA.ii.525).[/p][p]No Buddha is born during the samvattamānakappa, but only during the vivattamānakappa (SNA.i.51).  A Bodhisatta who excels in paññā can attain Buddhahood in four asankheyyas; one who exels in saddhā, in eight, and one whose viriya is the chief factor, in sixteen (SNA.i.47f).  When once a being has become a Bodhisatta there are eighteen conditions from which he is immune (SNA.i.50).  The Buddha is referred to under various epithets.  The Anguttara Nikāya gives one such list.  There he is called Samana, Brāhmana, Vedagū, Bhisaka, Nimmala, Vimala, Ñānī and Vimutta (C.iv.  340).  Buddhaghosa gives seven others: Cakkkumā, Sabbabhūtanukampī, Vihātaka, Mārasenappamaddī, Vusitavā, Vimutto and Angirasa (DA.iii.962f).[/p][p]The Buddha generally speaks of himself as Tathāgata.  This term is explained at great length in the Commentaries - e.g., DA.i.59f.  His followers usually address him as Bhagavā, while others call him by his name (Gotama).  In the case of Gotama Buddha, we find him also addressed as Sakka (SN.  vs.  345; perhaps the equivalent of Sākya), Brahma (SN.  p.91; SNA.ii.418), Mahāmuni (BuA.38) and Yakkha (M.i.386; also KS.i.262).  Countless other epithets occur in the books, especially in the later ones.  One very famous formula, used by Buddhists in their ritual, contains nine epithets, the formula being: Bhagavā araham sammāsambuddho, vijjācaranasampanno, sugato, lokavidū, anuttaro, purisadammasārathi, satthā devamanussānam, Buddho Bhagavā (these words are analysed and discussed in Vsm.  198 ff).  It is maintained (e.g., DA.i.288) that the Buddha's praises are limitless (aparimāna).  One of his most striking characteristics, mentioned over and over again, is his love of quiet.  [/p][p]E.g., D.i.178f.; he is also fond of solitude (patissallāna), (D.ii.70; A.iv.438f.; S.v.320f., etc.).  When he is in retirement it is usually akāla for visiting him (D.ii.270).  There are also certain accusations, which are brought against a Buddha by his rivals, for this very love of solitude.  "It is said that his insight is ruined by this habit of seclusion.  By intercourse with whom does he attain lucidity in wisdom? He is not at his ease in conducting an assembly, not ready in conversation, he is occupied only with the fringe of things.  He is like a one eyed cow, walking in a circle" (D.iii.38).[/p][p]In this his disciples followed his example (D.iii.37).  The dwelling place of a Buddha is called  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/g/gandhakuti,Gandhakuti')"]Gandhakuti[/a].  His footprint is called Padacetiya, and this can be seen only when he so desires it.  When once he wishes it to be visible, no one can erase it.  He can also so will that only one particular person shall see it (DhA.iii.194).  It is also said that his power of love is so great that no evil action can show its results in his presence (SNA.ii.475).  A Buddha never asks for praise, but if his praises are uttered in his presence he takes no offence (ThagA.ii.42).  When the Buddha is seated in some spot, none has the power of going through the air above him (SNA.i.222).  He prefers to accept the invitations of poor men to a meal (DhA.ii.135).[/p][p]See also  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/g/gotama,Gotama')"]Gotama[/a] and  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bodhisatta,Bodhisatta')"]Bodhisatta[/a].

Baka himself agrees with the Buddha, who tells him of planes of existence of which Baka knows nothing.  Baka then says that he will vanish from the Buddha's presence, but finds himself unable to do so.  The Buddha then vanishes and repeats a stanza for the Brahmās to hear.  Baka admits defeat, but Māra again enters into a Brahmā and asks the Buddha not to communicate his doctrine to others.  The Buddha refuses to agree to this.

When the messengers sent by the parents of Pipphali-mānava ( [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/maha_kassapa_th,Mahā Kassapa')"]Mahā Kassapa[/a]) were wandering about seeking for a wife for him to resemble the image they carried with them, they discovered Bhaddā and informed Pipphali's parents.  The parents arranged the marriage without the knowledge of the young people and Bhaddā went to Pipphali's house.  There they lived together, but, by mutual consent, the marriage was never consummated.  It was said that, she brought with her, on the day of her marriage, fifty thousand cartloads of wealth.  When Pipphali desired to leave the world, making over to her his wealth, she wished to renounce it likewise, and together they left the house in the guise of recluses, their hair shorn, unobserved by any.  In the village, however, they were recognized by their gait, and the people fell down at their feet.  They granted freedom to all their slaves, and set forth, Pipphali leading and Bhaddā following close behind.  On coming to a fork in the road, they agreed that he should take the right and she the left.

But later she was filled with remorse, took back the bowl, emptied it, scrubbed it with scented powder and, having filled it with the four sweet foods, sprinkled over the top ghee of the colour of a lotus calyx.  Handing it back to the Pacceka Buddha, she prayed to herself "May I have a shining body like this offering."[/p][p]In a later birth, Bhaddā was born as the daughter of a wealthy treasurer of Benares; she was given in marriage, but her body was of such evil odour that she was repulsive to all and was abandoned by several husbands.  Much troubled, she had her ornaments made into an ingot of gold and placed it on the shrine of Kassapa Buddha, which was in process of being built, and did reverence to it with her hands full of lotuses.  Her body immediately became fragrant and sweet, and she was married again to her first husband.

On his deathbed, he asked his son to continue with the alms, and, after death, he was reborn as Sakka.  His son followed him and became the god Canda.  His son Suriya, Suriya's son Mātalī, and Mātalī's son Pañcasikha, all followed in the same path.  But the sixth of the line, Bilārikosiya, became a miser and burnt the almonry.  Sakka and the others then came separately, in the guise of brahmins, to visit him and to ask for alms.  Kosiya refused their request until each one uttered a little verse, when he was asked to enter and receive a small gift.  Kosiya asked the servant to give each a little unhusked rice.  This was refused, and in the end he was obliged to give the brahmins cooked rice, meant for cows.  Each swallowed a mouthful, but then let it stick in his throat and lay down as if dead.  Kosiya, very frightened, had a meal prepared, which he put into their bowls, and then, calling in the passers by, asked them to note how the brahmins, in their greed, had eaten too much and died.  But the brahmins arose, spat out the rice, and publicly shamed Kosiya by showing up his miserliness and the manner in which he had disgraced his ancestors.  Then each revealed his identity and departed.  Bilārikosiya mended his ways and became most generous.[/p][p]The story was related to a monk reputed for his great generosity; he would not even drink a cup of water without sharing it.

When they investigated the cause for their carts thus stopping, a deity, their kinsman in a former life (their mother according to AA.i.207), pointed out to them the Buddha and asked them to give him a meal as he had eaten nothing for seven weeks.  Not waiting to cook, the merchants gave the Buddha some butter and honey in a bowl provided by the Four Regent Gods.  At the end of the meal the Buddha talked to them.  They accepted the Buddha and the Dhamma as their Refuge (the Dvevācikasarana, they thus became the Buddha's first lay disciples; A.i.26), and obtained from the Buddha a few hairs as an object of worship.

This was the spot at which all Buddhas set in motion the Wheel of the Law (Dhamma-cakka).  It is the custom of Buddhas to travel by air from the Bodhi-tree to the scene of their first sermon, a distance of eighteen leagues (MA.i.388; Bu.A.242, etc.), but the present Buddha did all the journey on foot in order to be able to meet on the way the Ajīvaka  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/upaka,Upaka')"]Upaka[/a].[/p][p]Benares was an important centre of trade and industry.  There was direct trade between there and  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/saavatthi,Sāvatthi')"]Sāvatthi[/a] (DhA.iii.429), the road passing through  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bhaddiya,Bhaddiya')"]Bhaddiya[/a] (Vin.i.189), and between there and  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/t/takkasilaa,Takkasilā')"]Takkasilā[/a] (DhA.i.123).  It was the custom for enthusiastic young men of Benares to go to the university at Takkasilā (E.g., J.ii.4; DhA.i.250), but there seem to have been educational institutions at Benares also, some of which were older than even those of Takkasilā (KhA.198; see also DhA.iii.445, where [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/susiima,Susīma')"]Susīma[/a], Sankha's son, goes from Takkasilā to Benares for purposes of study).  [/p][p]From Verañjā to Benares there seem to have been two routes: one rather circuitous, passing through Soreyya, and the other direct, crossing the Ganges at Payāgatittha.  From Benares the road continued to Vesāli (Sp.i.201).  On the road from Benares to Rājagaha was Andhakavinda (Vin.i.220).  There seems to have been friendly intercourse between the chieftains of Benares and the kings of Magadha, as shown by the fact that Bimbisāra sent his own physician, Jīvaka, to attend to the son of the Treasurer of Benares (Vin.i.275).  The distance from Kosambī to Benares was thirty leagues by river (MA.ii.929).[/p][p]The extent of the city of Benares, including its suburbs, at the time when it was the capital of an independent kingdom, is often stated (E.g., J.iv.377; vi.160; MA.ii.608) to have been twelve leagues.  The names of several kings are mentioned in the Jātakas, among them being those of Anga, Uggasena, Udaya, Kikī, Dhanañjaya, Mahāsīlava, Vissasena, and Samyama.  (The SNA.  on the Khaggavisāna Sutta contains the names of several kings of Benares who renounced the world and became Pacceka Buddhas).  [/p][p]The name which occurs most frequently, however, is that of Brahmadatta, which seems to have been the dynastic name of the Benares kings.  In the Mahāgovinda Sutta, the foundation of Bārānasī is attributed to Mahāgovinda, its first king being Dhatarattha, contemporary of Renu (D.ii.235).  The Ceylon Chronicles (MT.  127,129,130) mention the names of others who reigned in Benares- e.g., Duppasaha and sixty of his descendants; Asoka, son of Samankara, and eighty four thousand of his descendants; also sixteen kings, ancestors of Okkāka.  The city itself had been known by different names at different periods; thus, in the time of the Udaya Jātaka it was called Surundhana; in that of the Sutasoma, Sudassana; in that of the Sonananda, Brahmavaddhana; in that of the Khandahāla, Pupphavatī; in that of the Yuvañjaya, Rammanagara (J.iv.119f); and in that of the Sankha, Molinī (J.iv.15).  It was also called Kāsinagara and Kāsipura (E.g., J.v.54; vi.165; DhA.i.87), being the capital of Kāsi.  The Bhojājāniya Jātaka (J.i.178) says that "all the kings around coveted the kingdom of Benares." In the Brahāchatta Jātaka (J.iii.116), the king of Benares is mentioned as having captured the whole of Kosala.  At the time of the Buddha, however, Benares had lost its great political importance.  Kosala was already the paramount power in India, and several successful invasions of Kāsi by the Kosalans under their kings Vanka, Dabbasena and Kamsa, are referred to.  The final conquest would seem to be ascribed to Kamsa because the epithet Bārānasīggha (conqueror of Benares) is an established addition to his name (J.ii.403).[/p][p]Later, when Ajātasattu succeeded in establishing his sway over Kosala, with the help of the Licchavis, Kāsī, too, was included in his kingdom.  Even in the Buddha's time the city of Benares was wealthy and prosperous and was included in the list of great cities suggested by Ananda as suitable places for the Parinibbāna of the Buddha (D.ii.146).[/p][p]Mention is also made of a Bānārasīsetthi (E.g., DhA.i.412; iii.  87, 365) and a Santhāgārasālā (Mote Hall), which was then, however, no longer being used so much for the transaction of public business as for public discussions on religious and philosophical questions.  E.g., J.iv.74; ascetics who came to the city found lodging for the night in the Potters' Hall (e.g., DhA.i.39).  [/p][p]Near Benares was a grove of seven sirīsaka trees where the Buddha preached to the Nāga king Erakapatta (DhA.iii.230), and also the Kemiyambavana where Udena met Ghotamukha (M.ii.158); on the other side of the river was Vāsabhagāma, and beyond that another village called Cundatthila (PvA.168).[/p][p]The Buddha is several times spoken of as staying in Benares, where he preached several sermons (E.g., A.i.110f., 279f.; iii.392ff., 399ff.; S.i.105; v.406; Vin.i.189, 216f., 289) and converted many people including Yasa, whose home was in Benares (Vin.i.15), and his friends Vimala, Subāhu, Punnaji and Gavampati, all members of eminent families (Vin.i.19).  Isipatana (q.v.) became a monastic centre in the Buddha's time and continued so for long after.  From there came twelve thousand monks under the leadership of Dhammasena to be present at the ceremony of the foundation of the Mahā Thūpa (Mhv.xxix.31).[/p][p]In the past, Bārānasī was the birthplace of Kassapa Buddha (Bu.xxv.33).  In the time of Metteyya Buddha, Bārānasī will be known as Ketumatī at the head of eighty four thousand towns.  Sankha will be Cakkavatti there, but he will renounce the world and will become an arahant under Metteyya (D.iii.75f).  Bārānasī evidently derives its name from the fact that it lies between the two rivers Barnā and Asi (CAGI.499f).[/p][hr]</entry>

The cart was halted awhile, and the oxen, having got free from the yoke, entered the town.  Telling the child to sit near the cart, the father set off after the oxen.  Before he could return, the gate was shut, and the child owed his escape during the night from wild beasts and demons to his ñānavipphāra-iddhi.[/p][p]Although the place where he slept was near to a cemetery, no evil spirit could harm the boy as that birth was destined to be his last.

He belonged to a family of the Sākyan rājas of Kapilavatthu and entered the Order in the Anupiya Mango grove with Anuruddha and the others, soon afterwards attaining to arahantship.  Dwelling in the bliss of Nibbāna, under a tree in a lonely spot, Bhaddiya used to exclaim "Aho sukham, aho sukham." When this was reported to the Buddha, he questioned Bhaddiya, who answered that when he was ruling his principality he was well protected, yet was ever fearful and nervous, whereas now, having renounced all, he was free from all fear (Thag.vss.842-65; UdA.ii.10; Vin.i.183f.; J.i.140).  This incident was the occasion for the preaching of the Sukhavihārī Jātaka (q.v.).[/p][p]Bhaddiya was the son of Kāligodhā, the senior Sākyan lady of her time.  For five hundred births Bhaddiya had been king, hence his eminence in this life, though there were others more aristocratic (AA.i.109).  His resolve to gain this distinction was formed in the time of Padumuttara Buddha, when he was born in a very rich family and did various good deeds towards that end.  In the interval between Kassapa Buddha and Gotama Buddha, he was a householder of Benares and, discovering that Pacceka Buddhas took their meals on the banks of the Ganges, placed seven stone planks for them to sit on (ThagA.ii.55f.; Ap.i.95f).  When Bhaddiya was ruling his Sākyan principality he had as general Sona Potiriyaputta, who later joined the Order (ThagA.i.316).  Anuruddha was Bhaddiya's great friend, and when Anuruddha wished to renounce the world, his mother agreed only on condition that Bhaddiya should accompany him, hoping, in this way, to hold him back.  But Anuruddha overcame all Bhaddiya's objections and persuaded him to renounce the household life within a week.

For three months he avoided the Buddha, until, just before the Buddha was starting on a journey, Bhaddāli, acting on the advice of his fellow monks, confessed his fault to the Buddha and begged for forgiveness (M.i.437ff).

Desirous of eating venison cooked on charcoal, he gave the kingdom in charge of his courtiers and went to the Himālaya on a hunting expedition.  While wandering about near Gandhamādana, among pleasant streams and groves, he came across two kinnaras fondly embracing each other and then weeping and wailing most pitifully.  The king quieted his hounds, laid down his weapons, and approached the kinnaras.  In answer to his questions, the female told him that one day, while she was picking flowers on the opposite bank for a garland for her lover, it grew late and a storm arose.  The stream which separated the two lovers swelled in flood and they had to spend the night apart from each other.  The memory of one night, thus passed in separation, had filled them with sorrow for six hundred and ninety seven years, and they still wept whenever they thought of it.[/p][p]The story was told in reference to a quarrel between  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/pasenadi,Pasenadi')"]Pasenadi[/a] and  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/mallikaa,Mallikā')"]Mallikā[/a] about conjugal rights.

Uttara therefore visited the Buddha and, having seen the thirty two marks, resolved to observe the Buddha in his every posture and, to this end, followed him about for seven months.  He then returned to Brahmāyu and told him of the result of his investigations.  Brahmāyu folded his palms reverently and uttered the praises of the Buddha.  Soon after, the Buddha came to Mithilā and took up his residence in the Makhādeva ambavana.  Brahmāyu, having sent a messenger to announce his arrival, visited the Buddha.

Three times the request was made, three times the Buddha kept silence.  Thereupon  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/aa/aananda,Ananda')"]Ananda[/a] asked for the carpeting to be removed, saying that the Buddha's refusal to step thereon was as an example to future generations.

Bodhi was saying to himself: "If I am to have a son, the Buddha will step on this carpet, if not, he will not." The Buddha knew also that Bodhi was not destined to have a son because in a previous life he and his wife had lived on an island and eaten young birds.

Later, after Bodhi's birth, his nurse took him to the Buddha at Bhesakalāvana and made a similar declaration.  When, therefore, Bodhi acknowledged the Buddha as his teacher, at the conclusion of the  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bodhirajakumara_s,Bodhirājakumāra Sutta')"]Bodhirājakumāra Sutta[/a], he was seeking the Buddha's refuge for the third time.[/p][p]Some accounts* of the building of Bodhi's palace add that as it was being completed, Bodhi conceived the idea of killing the architect or of blinding him so that he could never design a similar house for anyone else.

[/div][p]Reference is made in the Ceylon Chronicles and in some of the Commentaries to a period of great distress in Ceylon, owing to the activities of a cora (? brigand) called Brāhmanatissa in the time of Vattagāmanī-Abhaya (Pitirājā).  [/p][p]According to the Mahāvamsa and the Mahāvamsa Tīkā (Mhv.xxxiii.37ff.; MT.613), Tissa was a brahmin youth of Rohana.  One day he heard a brahmin soothsayer announce that if a brigand were to commence his activities under a certain combination of planets, he would conquer the whole of Ceylon.  Tissa, acting on this idea, turned robber and sent word to the king that he should hand over his throne to him.  At the same time seven Damilas, with their followers, arrived in Mahātittha with the same demand.  The king thereupon sent word to Tissa that the kingdom would be his if he could defeat the Damilas.  Tissa agreed to this and marched against them, but was taken captive in a battle near Sanketahāla.  The Pāli Commentaries give further details.  Tissa plundered the land for twelve long years; food became so scarce that, owing to starvation, people lost even their sexual desires, and the birth of a child was such a rare occurrence that all the land rejoiced over such a birth (SA.ii.83).  Tissa's activities were at their height when Vattagāmanī was in hiding.  The stores of food in Cittalapabbata vihāra and in Tissamahārāma were laid waste by enormous rats and the monks could obtain no food, Tissa having ravished the land.  They therefore sent eight Theras to Sakka, begging him to rid the country of Tissa; but Sakka sent reply that he was powerless, and suggested that the monks should go over the seas.  Some took his advice and sailed from Jambukola, but the leaders of the community - Samyuttabhānaka Cūlasīva, Isidatta and Mahāsona - remained behind awaiting better times (see also Nāgā Therī, whose story given in AA.ii.654f.; also MA.i.546).  The Mahāvihāra at Anurādhapura was deserted; the Mahā Thūpa was overgrown with trees.  The monks had to live on lotus stalks and fruit rinds thrown away by the people.  When Brāhmanatissa died, Vattagāmanī once more came to the throne (VibhA.445-51).  v.l.  Brāhmanatiya cora (from which the Ceylon Chronicles derive the form Bāminitiyā).

By the power of the devatā, Bāhiya reached Sāvatthi in one night, a distance of one hundred and twenty leagues, and was told that the Buddha was in the city begging alms.  Bāhiya followed him thither and begged to be taught something for his salvation.  Twice he asked and twice the Buddha refused, saying that it was not the hour for teaching.  But Bāhiya insisted, saying that life was uncertain and that the Buddha or he might die.  [/p][p]The Commentaries say that Bāhiya was excited by his meeting with the Buddha and that the Buddha wished to give him time to regain his calm, hence his refusal.  The Buddha knew of his impending death and of his upanissaya for arahantship.  He was a pacchimabhavika.[/p][p]The Buddha then taught him the proper method of regarding all sense experiences - namely, as experiences and no more.  Even as he listened, Bāhiya became an  [a href="http://www.palikanon.com/english/wtb/a/ariya_puggala,arahant')"]arahant[/a] and the Buddha left him.  Shortly after, Bāhiya was gored to death by a cow with calf (cp.  the story of  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pu/pukkusati,Pukkusāti')"]Pukkusāti[/a]).  The Buddha, seeing his body lying on the dung heap, asked the monks to remove it and to have it burnt, erecting a thūpa over the remains.  In the assembly he declared Bāhiya to be foremost among those who instantly comprehended the Truth (khippābhiññānam) (A.i.24; Ud.i.10).[/p][p]Bāhiya's resolve to attain to this eminence was made in the time of Padumuttara Buddha when he heard the Buddha declare a monk foremost in instantaneous comprehension.  In the time of Kassapa Buddha, when the Buddha's teachings were fading from the minds of men, Bāhiya was one of seven monks who climbed a rock, determined not to leave it until they had attained their goal.  Their leader became an arahant and the second an anāgāmī - passing into the Suddhāvāsa world; the rest were reborn in this age as Pukkusāti, Kumāra Kassapa, Dabba-Mallaputta, Sabhiya and Bāhiya.  Although Bāhiya had kept the precepts in previous births, he had never given a bowl or a robe to a monk.  For this reason the Buddha did not, at the end of his sermon, ordain him by the "ehi bhikkhu pabbajā." The Buddha knew that Bāhiya had not sufficient merit to obtain divine robes.  Some say that he was once a brigand and had shot a Pacceka Buddha with an arrow and had taken possession of the Pacceka Buddha's begging bowl and robe.  [/p][p]Bāhiya met his death while searching for a robe in which to be ordained (UdA.77ff.; AA.i.156ff.; DhA.ii.209ff.; Ap.ii.475ff).

  <entry>[div class="huge"]Bodhirukka[/div][p]The generic name given to the tree under which a Buddha attains Enlightenment (D.A.ii.416).  The tree is different in the case of each Buddha.  Thus, [/p][ul][li]for Gotama and also for Kondañña it was an asvattha; [/li][li]for Dīpankara a sirīsa; [/li][li]for Mangala, Sumana, Revata and Sobhita a nāga; [/li][li]for Anomadassī an ajjuna; [/li][li]for Paduma and Nārada a mahāsona; [/li][li]for Padumuttara a salala; [/li][li]for Sumedha a nimba; [/li][li]for Sujāta a bamboo; [/li][li]for Piyadassī a kakudha; [/li][li]for Atthadassī a campaka; [/li][li]for Dhammadassī a bimbajāla; [/li][li]for Siddhattha a kanikāra; [/li][li]for Tissa an asana; [/li][li]for Phussa an āmanda; [/li][li]for Vipassī a pātalī; [/li][li]for Sikhī a pundarīka; [/li][li]for Vessabhū a sāla; [/li][li]for Kakusandha a sirīsa; [/li][li]for Konāgamma an udumbara; [/li][li]for Kassapa a banyan (see passim; the details differ some what at BuA.247).  [/li][/ul][p]The site of the Bodhi tree is the same for all Buddhas (BuA.247), and it forms the navel of the earth (J.iv.233) (puthuvinābhi).  No other place can support the weight of the Buddha's attainment.  J.iv.229.[/p][p]When no Bodhi tree grows, the Bodhimanda (ground round the Bodhi-tree), for a distance of one royal karīsa, is devoid of all plants, even of any blade of grass, and is quite smooth, spread with sand like a silver plate, while all around it are grass, creepers and trees.  None can travel in the air immediately above it, not even Sakka (J.iv.232f).[/p][p]When the world is destroyed at the end of a kappa, the Bodhimanda is the last spot to disappear; when the world emerges into existence again, it is the first to appear.  A lotus springs there bringing it into view and if during the kappa thus begun a Buddha will be born, the lotus puts forth flowers, according to the number of Buddhas (DA.ii.412).[/p][p]In the case of Gotama Buddha, his Bodhi tree sprang up on the day he was born (DA.ii.425; BuA.248).  After his Enlightenment, he spent a whole week in front of it, standing with unblinking eyes, gazing at it with gratitude.  A shrine was later erected on the spot where he so stood, and was called the Animisalocana cetiya (q.v.).  The spot was used as a shrine even in the lifetime of the Buddha, the only shrine that could be so used.  While the Buddha was yet alive, in order that people might make their offerings in the name of the Buddha when he was away on pilgrimage, he sanctioned the planting of a seed from the Bodhi tree in Gayā in front of the gateway of Jetavana.  For this purpose Moggallāna took a fruit from a tree at Gayā as it dropped from its stalk, before it reached the ground.  It was planted in a golden jar by Anāthapindika with great pomp and ceremony.  A sapling immediately sprouted forth, fifty cubits high, and in order to consecrate it the Buddha spent one night under it, wrapt in meditation.  This tree, because it was planted under the direction of Ananda, came to be known as the Ananda Bodhi (J.iv.228ff).[/p][p]According to the Ceylon Chronicles (e.g., Mhv.xv), branches from the Bodhi trees of all the Buddhas born during this kappa were planted in Ceylon on the spot where the sacred Bodhi tree stands today in Anurādhapura.  The branch of Kakusandha's tree was brought by a nun called Rucānandā, Konagamana's by Kantakānandā (or Kanakadattā), and Kassapa's by Sudhammā.  Asoka was most diligent in paying homage to the Bodhi tree, and held a festival every year in its honour in the month of Kattika (Mhv.xvii.17).  His queen, Tissarakkhā was jealous of the Tree, and three years after she became queen (i.e., in the nineteenth year of Asoka's reign), she caused the tree to be killed by means of mandu thorns (Mhv.xx.4f).  The tree, however, grew again, and a great monastery was attached to the Bodhimanda.  Among those present at the foundation of the Mahā Thūpa are mentioned thirty thousand monks, from this Vihāra, led by Cittagutta (Mhv.xxix.41).[/p][p]Kittisirimegha of Ceylon, contemporary of Samudragupta, erected with the permission of Samudragupta, a Sanghārāma near the Mahābodhi-vihāra, chiefly for the use of the Singhalese monks who went to worship the Bodhi tree.  The circumstances in connection with the Sanghārāma are given by Hiouen Thsang (Beal, op.  cit., 133ff) who gives a description of it as seen by himself.  It was probably here that Buddhaghosa met the Elder Revata who persuaded him to come to Ceylon.[/p][p]In the twelfth year of Asoka's reign the right branch of the Bodhi tree was brought by Sanghamittā to Anurādhapura and placed by Devānāmpiyatissa in the Mahāmeghavana.  The Buddha, on his death bed, had resolved five things, one being that the branch which should be taken to Ceylon should detach itself (Mhv.xvii.46f).  From Gayā, the branch was taken to Pātaliputta, thence to Tāmalittī, where it was placed in a ship and taken to Jambukola, across the sea; finally it arrived at Anurādhapura, staying on the way at Tivakka.  Those who assisted the king at the ceremony of the planting of the Tree were the nobles of Kājaragāma and of Candanagāma and of Tivakka.  From the seeds of a fruit which grew on the tree sprang eight saplings, which were planted respectively [/p][ul][li]at Jambukola, [/li][li]in the village of Tivakka, [/li][li]at Thūpārāmā, [/li][li]at Issaramanārāma, [/li][li]in the court of the Pathamacetiya, [/li][li]in Cetiyagiri, [/li][li]in Kājaragāma and [/li][li]in Candanagāma (Mhv.xix.60ff.; for details in connection with the bringing of the Bodhitree, see Mbv.144 ff).  [/li][/ul][p]Thirty-two other saplings, from four other fruits, were planted here and there at a distance of one yojana.  Ceremonies were instituted in honour of the Tree, the supervision of which was given over to Bodhāhārakula, at the head of which were the eight ministers of Asoka who, led by Bodhigutta and Sumitta (see Mbv.165f., for the names of the others), were sent as escorts of the Tree.  Revenues were provided for these celebrations.[/p][p]Later, King Dhātusena built a Bodhighara or roof over the Tree (Cv.xxxviii.431) while Silākāla made daily offerings at the shrine (see Cv.Trs.i.32, n.  6; Cv.xli.29), and Kittisirimegha had the Bodhighara covered with tin plates (Cv.xli.65).  Mahānāga had the roof of the Bodhighara gilded, built a trench round the courtyard and set up Buddha images in the image house (Cv.xli.94).  Aggabodhi I.  erected a stone terrace round the Tree and placed, at the bottom of it, an oil pit to receive the oil for illuminations on festival days (Cv.xlii.19).  Aggabodhi II.  had a well dug for the use of pilgrims (Cv.xlii.66), and Moggallāna III.  held a great celebration in the Tree's honour (Cv.xliv.45).  [/p][p]Aggabodhi VII found the Bodhighara in ruins and had it rebuilt (Cv.xlviii.70); Mahinda II instituted a regular offering in its honour (Cv.xlviii.124), and Udaya III gave a village near Anurādhapura to the service of the Bodhi tree.

One day, through her lattice, Bhaddā saw Sattuka being led by the city guard to execution on a charge of robbery.  She fell at once in love with him and refused to live without him.  Her father, out of his love for her, bribed the guard to release Sattuka, let him be bathed in perfumed water, and brought him home, where Bhaddā, decked in jewels, waited upon him.  Very soon, Sattuka began to covet her jewels and told her that he had made a vow to the deity of the Robbers' Cliff that, should he escape, he would bring him an offering.  She trusted him and, making ready an offering, went with him arrayed in all her ornaments.  On arriving at the top of the cliff, he told her of his purpose, and she, all undaunted, begged of him to let her embrace him on all sides.  He agreed to this, and then, making as if to embrace him from the back, she pushed him over the cliff.  The deity of the mountain praised her presence of mind saying that men were not in all cases wiser than women.[/p][p]Unwilling to return home after what had happened; she joined the Order of the white robed Niganthas.  As she wished to practise extreme austerities, they dragged out her hair with a palmyra comb.  Her hair grew again in close curls, and so they called her Kundala-kesā ("Curly-hair").  Dissatisfied with the teaching of the Niganthas, she left them, and going to various teachers, became very, proficient in discussion and eager for debate.  She would enter a village and, making a heap of sand at the gate, set up the branch of a rose apple saying, "Whoever wishes to enter into discussion with me, let him trample on this bough." One day, Sāriputta, seeing the bough outside Sāvatthi, ordered some children to trample on it.  Bhaddā then went to Jetavana accompanied by a large crowd whom she had invited to be present at the discussion.  Sāriputta suggested that Bhaddā should first ask him questions; to all of these he replied until she fell silent.  It was then his turn, and he asked "One what is that?" (probably meaning: "state any one fact true for everyone") She, unable to answer, asked him to be her teacher.  But Sāriputta sent her to the Buddha, who preached to her that it were better to know one single stanza bringing calm and peace than one thousand verses bringing no profit.  At the end of this sermon, Bhaddā attained arahantship, and the Buddha himself ordained her.[/p][p]In the time of Padumuttara Buddha, she had heard him preach and place as foremost among nuns one whose intuition was swift (khippābhiññā).  She vowed that this rank should one day be hers.  Later, when Kassapa was Buddha, she was one of the seven daughters of Kikī, king of Benares, and was named Bhikkhadāyikā (v.l.  Bhikkhudāsikā).

Later he renounced the world and, with a large band of followers, wandered about Anga, Magadha and Kururattha,, teaching a cult of nature-worship.  The Buddha, seeing his upanissaya, sent Moggallāna to convert him.  Moggallāna went to Aggidatta's hermitage, but being refused shelter there, vanquished, by a display of iddhi-power, a nāgarāja, Ahicchatta, who lived in the neighbourhood, and occupied the nāga's abode.  While Aggidatta and his followers stand awestruck at this event, the Buddha appears, and realising that the Buddha is even greater than Moggallāna, they pay homage to him.

Somadatta's presence of mind saved the situation (DhA.iii.124-5).  In the Somadatta Jātaka the name Aggidatta does not appear.  In the present age he was the Thera Lāludāyī.

J.iv.363; they were called brahmins by courtesy vohāravasena (ibid., 366).[/p][p][/p][p]According to the Mānavadhammasāstra, they were not sprung from Ksatriya father and a slave (presumably Sudra) mother, as given in the Ambattha Sutta, but from a brahmin father and a Vaisya mother.[/p][p][/p][p]The Ambatthas were of an old stock and were well known.

When Moggallāna visited Aggidatta and asked him for a lodging, Aggidatta refused to give him one, but Moggallāna, in spite of his protests, occupied the sand-hill.  Moggallāna overcame the power of the Nāga king by his iddhi-power, and when Aggidatta and his followers visited him the next morning, they found Ahicchatta standing with his hood over Moggallāna's head as protection for him from the sun.

It is said that while the sutta was being preached sixty monks vomited hot blood, sixty left the Order in diffidence and sixty others became arahants (A.iv.135).

It was surrounded and well guarded by a rampart, and its rest-house was adorned with paintings for the king's amusement.[/p][p]It was one of the spots in which the Buddha rested during his last tour, and we are told that while there he discoursed to a large number of monks (D.ii.81; he remained there one night, UdA.408).

Ambalatthikā.[/b]-A park in the brahmin village Khānumata.  The Buddha went there during one of his tours through Magadha.  On this occasion was preached the  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kuutadanta_s,Kūtadanta Sutta')"]Kūtadanta Sutta[/a] (D.i.127).

In the Mahāvamsa account (Mhv.xxvii.11-20) of the building of the Lohapāsāda we are told that the plans were copied from the gem-palace of the goddess Bīranī.  The central part of the palace was called the Ambalatthikapāsāda.  "It was visible from every side, bright, with pennons hung out."[/p][p]Dutthagāmani probably included a similar central part in the Lohapāsāda.

The king, having heard of Bimbādevī's affliction, ordered that she should be continually supplied with mango-syrup.

Sakka, becoming nervous on account of the austerities of an ascetic, wishes to destroy him, and arouses in the queen a desire for a "Midmost Mango" (Abbhantara-Amba).  After prolonged search - during which the ascetic and his companions are driven from the royal park because they are reported to have eaten the mangoes there - a favourite parrot of the palace is commissioned to find the Midmost Mango.  He goes to Himavā, and learns from the parrots of the seventh mountain range that the mango grows on a tree which belongs to Vessavana and which is most strictly guarded.  He goes stealthily by night to the tree, but is caught by the guardian goblins, who decide to kill him.  He tells them that he is delighted to die in the performance of his duty, and thereby wins their respect.  Following their counsel, he seeks the assistance of an ascetic, Jotirasa, living in a hut called Kañcanapatti, to whom Vessavana sends a daily offering of four mangoes.  The ascetic gives the parrot two mangoes, one for himself and one for the queen.  J.ii.392-400.[/p][p][/p][p]Ananda was the parrot and Sāriputta Jotirasa.  [/p][hr]</entry>

A brahmin youth of the Ambattha clan who lived with his teacher, Pokkharasādi, at Ukkatthā.  He was learned in the three Vedas and the correlated branches of knowledge, including the Lokāyata, as recorded in the Ambattha Sutta (D.i.87ff).  Once, at the request of his teacher, he visited the Buddha in the Icchānadkala wood and seems to have opened his conversation by reviling the Sākiyans and calling them menials.  It appears that Ambattha had once gone on some business of Pokkharasādi's to Kapilavatthu, to the Mote Hall of the Sākyans, and had been insulted there (D.i.91).[/p][p]Asked by the Buddha to what family he belonged, Ambattha replied that he came of the Kanhāyana-gotta; thereupon the Buddha traced the family back to its ancestor, who had been the offspring of a slave girl of Okkāka, named Disā.  The child had been able to talk as soon as he was born and, because of this devilish trait, had been called Kanha (devil), hence the family name.  Kanha later became a mighty seer and married Maddarūpī, daughter of Okkāka (D.i.96-7).[/p][p]Ambattha makes no remonstrance against this genealogy and, under pressure, accepts it as true.  This gives the Buddha an opportunity of preaching on the futility of feeling vanity regarding one's caste and on the worth of morality and conduct.[/p][p]At the end of the discourse the Buddha walked up and down outside his chamber so that Ambattha might see on his body the thirty-two signs of a great man.  Ambattha goes back to Pokkharasadi and reports the whole interview.  Pokkharasādi is greatly incensed, abuses Ambattha and kicks him.  Later Pokkharasādi goes himself to the Buddha and invites him for a meal.  At the end of the meal the Buddha instructs him in his Doctrine and is accepted as the Teacher both of Pokkharasādi himself and of his followers and dependants at Ukkatthā.  Pokkharasādi himself becomes a Sotāpanna (DA.i.278).[/p][p]We are not told that Ambattha became a follower of the Buddha.  Buddhaghosa says (DA.i.274) that the Buddha knew that Ambattha would not profit by his discourse in his present life (iminā attabhāvena magga-pātubhāvo natthi), and that therefore a sermon with the idea of converting him would only have meant spending unnecessary time.  Ambattha himself only visited the Buddha on account of his interest in physiognomy.

  <entry>[div class="huge"]Ajapala-nigrodha[/div][p]A banyan tree which is famous in Buddhist literature.  It was in Uruvelā, on the banks of the Nerañjara, near the Bodhi tree, and a week after the Enlightenment the Buddha went there and spent a week cross-legged at the foot of the tree.  There he met the Huhunkajātika Brahmin (Vin.i.2-3).  Two weeks later he went there again from the Rajāyatana (Vin.i.4).  It was then that the Brahma Sahampati appeared to him and persuaded him to preach the doctrine, in spite of the difficulty of the task (Vin.i.5-7; in the eighth week after the Enlightenment, says Buddhaghosa, SA.i.152).  This was immediately after the meal offered by Tapassu and Bhalluka, so says the Majjhima Atthakathā (i.385; J.i.81).  When the Buddha wishes to have someone as his teacher, Sahampati appears again and suggests to him that the Dhamma be considered his teacher (A.ii.20f.; S.i.138f).[/p][p][/p][p]By Ajapāla-nigrodha it was, too, that, immediately after the Enlightenment, Mara tried to persuade the Buddha to die at once (D.ii.112).  Several other conversations held here with Mara are recorded in the Samyutta (S.i.103f).[/p][p]Here, also, the Buddha spent some time before the Enlightenment (D.ii.267), and it was here that Sujata offered him a meal of milk-rice (J.i.16, 69).[/p][p][/p][p]Here, in the fifth week after the Enlightenment, Mara's daughters tried to tempt the Buddha (J.i.78, 469).'[/p][p]Several etymologies are suggested for the name: (a) in its shadow goatherds (ajapālā) rest; (b) old brahmins, incapable of reciting the Vedas, live here in dwellings protected by walls and ramparts (this derivation being as follows: na japantī ti =ajapā, mantānam anajjhāyakā=ajapā, ālenti arīyanti nivāsam etthāti=Ajapālo ti); (c) it shelters the goats that seek its shade at midday (UdA.51).  The northern Buddhists say that the tree was planted by a shepherd boy, during the Bodhisatta's six years' penance, to shelter him (Beal, Romantic Legend of Buddha,192, 238; Mtu.iii.302).[/p][p][/p][p]The Brahmā Sutta (S.v.167) and the Magga Sutta (S.v.185), both on the four satipatthāna, and another Brahmā Sutta (S.v.232f) on the five indriyāni, were concerning thoughts that occurred to the Buddha on various occasions at the foot of this tree, when he sat there soon after the Enlightenment.  On all these occasions Brahma Sahampati appeared to him and confirmed his thoughts.  Several old brahmins, advanced in years, visited the Buddha during this period and questioned him as to whether it were true that he did not pay respect to age.  To them he preached the four Thera-karanā dhamma.  A.ii.22.[/p][hr]</entry>

  <entry>[div class="huge"]Addhakāsī Therī[/div][p]In Kassapa Buddha's time she had been a nun well established in the precepts.  But she reviled an arahant Therī by calling her a prostitute, and for this she was born in purgatory.  In the present age she was the daughter of a rich and distinguished citizen of Benares but, because of her former evil speech, became a prostitute in Rājagaha.  Having heard the Buddha preach, she entered the Order of the bhikkhunis.  Wishing to obtain the higher ordination from the Buddha, she set out for Sāvatthi, but was waylaid and stopped by libertines.  So she sent a man to ask the Buddha's advice and he permitted her to be ordained by a messenger (Thig.vv.25-6; ThigA.30ff.; Vin.ii.277; Ap.  ii.  610-11).  Her case established a precedent (Sp.i.242).  Later she attained arahantship.[/p][p]It has been suggested (VT.iii.360, n.3; and VT.ii.195-6, n.3) that her name "half Kāsī" might mean that she charged five hundred pieces from her patrons.  For, according to Buddhaghosa, Kāsī means one thousand, and anything worth one thousand is called kāsiya.[/p][p]Another explanation is, however, given by Dhammapāla (ThigA.32).  The revenue which accrued to the king for one day from Kāsī was a thousand.  Addhakāsī's patrons had to give a like sum to spend a night with her.  This is referred to in one of the verses attributed to her in the Theragāthā (v.25).  For this reason she was called Kāsī.  But later, many men, not being able to afford a thousand, would pay half the amount and spend the day with her.  As a result she became known as Addhakāsī.[/p][hr]</entry>

Wishing to possess her, he commandeered her husband's services and one day ordered him to bring mud and lotuses from a pond three leagues away, his life to be the penalty if he did not return the same evening.  Meanwhile Ambasakkhara ordered the guards to shut the city gates earlier than usual.  The woman's husband returned to the city before nightfall, but finding the gates shut, he asked a thief, who was impaled just outside, to bear witness to his having arrived before sunset.[/p][p]The thief's uncle had been a pious merchant in Vesāli, but had been beheaded for alleged implication in his nephew's theft.  He had been reborn as a peta, and because of his good deeds he possessed various powers.  By reason, however, of having once hidden, in jest, the clothes of a friend who was bathing in the river, he was born naked.  Every night he came to see his nephew and encouraged him to go on living, in spite of his impalement, because the peta knew that suffering in hell awaited the thief after death.[/p][p]When the man with the lotuses asked the thief's assistance in proving his innocence, he was advised to await the peta's arrival that night and to get his counsel.  This the man did, and when, the next day, he was summoned before Ambasakkhara, he cited the peta as witness for his defence.  Ambasakkhara agreed to test the truth of the story, and in the night he saw the peta and learnt all that had happened.  Greatly marvelling, he offered to help the peta in getting rid of his nudity.  He was asked to seek the holy Elder  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kappitaka_th,Kappitaka')"]Kappitaka[/a] who lived in  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kapinacanaa,Kapinaccanā')"]Kapinaccanā[/a] in the  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/va/vajjii,Vajji')"]Vajji[/a] country and give him robes in the peta's name.

[/p][p]She is said to have come spontaneously into being at Vesāli in the gardens of the king.  The gardener found her at the foot of a mango tree - hence her name - and brought her to the city.  She grew up so full of beauty and of grace that many young princes vied with each other for the honour of her hand.  Finally, in order to end their strife, they appointed her courtesan.  Later she became a devout follower of the Buddha, and building a vihāra in her own garden, gave it to him and the Order.  This was during the Buddha's last visit to Vesāli shortly before his death.  It is said that when Ambapālī heard of the Buddha's visit to Kotigāma near Vesāli she and her retinue drove out of the city in magnificent chariots to meet him, and, after hearing a discourse, invited him and the monks to a meal the next day.  The Buddha accepted this invitation and had, as a result, to refuse that of the  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/l/licchavi,Licchavis')"]Licchavis[/a] of Vesāli.[/p][p]While returning from her visit to the Buddha, Ambapālī was so elated at the idea of having the Buddha to a meal the next day, that she refused to make way for the Licchavi princes who were on their way to the Buddha.  She refused to give up her invitation for anything in the world.  The DA.  says that just before Ambapālī's visit to him, the Buddha admonished the monks to be steadfast and mindful, lest they should lose their heads about her (DA.ii.545).[/p][p]It was after this meal that Ambapālī gave over her park, the Ambapālivana, to the Buddha and the Order.  The Buddha accepted the gift and stayed there some time before going on to Beluva.

Seeing the spittle and not knowing who had committed the fault, she said in reproof, "What prostitute has been spitting here?" It was owing to this remark that she was born as a courtesan in her last birth (ThigA.206-7).[/p][p]The Apadāna (quoted also in ThigA) gives some more details about her.  She had been a daughter of a Khattiya family in the time of Phussa Buddha and had done many good deeds in order to be beautiful in later births.  As a result of the abuse of the nun (referred to above) she had been born in hell and later had, for ten thousand lives, been a courtesan.  In Kassapa Buddha's time she had practised celibacy (Ap.ii.613ff.  ; ThigA.213f).[/p][p]It is said that she charged fifty kahāpanas a night from her patrons and that Vesāli became very prosperous through her.

  <entry>[div class="huge"]Aggālava Cetiya[/div][p]The chief shrine at Ālavī (SnA.i.344; SA.i.207) (hence probably the name), originally a pagan place of worship, but later converted into a Buddhist vihāra.  The Buddha stopped here on many occasions during his wanderings, and this was the scene of several Vinaya rules, e.g.  against monks digging the ground (Vin.iv.32) and cutting trees (Vin.iv.34), using unfiltered water for building purposes (Vin.iv.48), sleeping in the company of novices (Vin.iv.16), giving new buildings in hand (Vin.ii.172f).[/p][p][/p][p]The Chabbaggiyā are censured here for a nissaggiya offence (Vin.iii.224).  The Vangīsa Sutta was preached there to Vangīsa, on the occasion of the death of his preceptor, Nigrodhakappa (Sn.59f).  In the early years of Vangīsa's novitiate he stayed at the shrine with his preceptor, and disaffection arose within him twice, once because of women, the second time because of his tutor's solitary habits (S.i.185-6), and later, again, through pride in his own powers of improvisation (patibhāna) (S.i.187).  Here, again, the Buddha utters the praises of Hatthaka Alavaka, who visits him with a large following, whose fealty has been won (according to Hatthaka) by observing the four characteristics of sympathy (sangahavatthūni) learnt from the Buddha (A.iv.216-20).[/p][p][/p][p]Many lay-women and nuns flocked there by day to hear the Buddha preach, but none were there when he preached in the evenings (J.i.160).  It was here that the Manikantha Jātaka was related (J.ii.282), also the Brahmadatta Jātaka (J.iii.78), and the Atthisena Jātaka (J.iii.351), all in connection with the rules for building cells.

  <entry>[div class="huge"]Ajatasattu[/div][p]Son of Bimbisāra, King of Magadha, and therefore half-brother to Abhayarājakumara.  He succeeded his father to the throne.  His mother was a daughter of Mahākosala (J.iii.121), and he married Vajirā, Pasenadi's daughter (J.iv.343), by whom be had a son Udāyibhadda (D.i.50).[/p][p][/p][p]Ajatasattu grew up to be a noble and handsome youth.  Devadatta was, at this time, looking for ways and means of taking revenge on the Buddha, and seeing in the prince a very desirable weapon, he exerted all his strength to win him to his side.  Ajatasattu was greatly impressed by Devadatta's powers of iddhi and became his devoted follower (Vin.ii.185; J.i.185-6).  He built for him a monastery at Gayāsīsa and waited upon him morning and evening carrying food for him, sometimes as much as five hundred cartloads in five hundred cooking pans (S.ii.242).[/p][p][/p][p]Devadatta incited him to seize the throne, killing his father if necessary.  When Bimbisāra learnt of the prince's intentions he abdicated in his favour.  But Devadatta was not satisfied till Bimbisāra, who was one of the Buddha's foremost supporters, was killed.  (DA.i.135-7).  According to the Sankicca Jātaka (J.v.262ff.) he had killed his father in previous births too.[/p][p]Ajātasattu helped Devadatta in several of the latter's attempts to kill the Buddha (See Devadatta).  In the Sanjiva Jātaka (J.  i.  [st2:frenchfranctoeuro ProductID="510 f"]510 f[/st2:frenchfranctoeuro].) we are told that in past lives he had associated with the sinful and once lost his life as a result.  [/p][p]Later he was filled with remorse for these past misdeeds as he confesses himself (D.i.85); but evidently, for very shame, he refrained from visiting the Buddha till he was won over by the persuasions of his physician Jīvaka Komārabhacca.  And when in the end he did go to the Buddha, it was in great fear and trembling; so nervous was he that he imagined conspirators in the very silence surrounding the Buddha where he dwelt in the monastery, in Jivaka's Mango grove at Rājagaha (D.i.49-50; J.v.262-9. An illustration of this visit is the subject of one of the bas-reliefs on the Barhut Tope; Cunningham, Pl.  xvi., fig.36, and p.135).  [/p][p]It was on the occasion of this visit that the Sāmaññaphala Sutta was preached.  The king admits that he had been to various teachers before, but had failed to find satisfaction in their teachings.  It is noteworthy that the Buddha greets the king cordially on his arrival and makes no mention whatever of the king's impiety.  Instead, when Ajātasattu expresses his repentance at the end of the discourse, the Buddha accepts his confession and lets him off almost too lightly.  But after the king had departed the Buddha tells the monks how the king's misdeeds had wrought his undoing both in this world and the next, for if he had not been guilty of them, the Eye of Truth (Sotāpattimagga, says the Commentary) would have been opened for him on the occasion of this sermon.  (D.i.85-6).  It is said that from the day of his father's death he could not sleep on account of terrifying dreams, particularly after he had heard of Devadatta's dire fate (J.i.508).  He slept after his visit to the Buddha (DA.i.238).  [/p][p][/p][p]Henceforth the king became a loyal adherent of the Buddha's faith, though, as far as we know, he never waited again either upon the Buddha or upon any member of the Order for the discussion of ethical matters.  (But see DA.i.238, where we are told "tinnam ratanānam mahāsakkāram akāsi").  He was so full of love and respect for the Buddha that when he heard of Upaka Mandikāputta having spoken rather impolitely to the Buddha, he at once flew into a rage (A.ii.182).[/p][p]Sakka said of him that among the puthujjanas he was most possessed of piety (DA.ii.610).  When the Buddha died, in the eighth year of Ajātasattu reign (Mhv.ii.32), the latter's ministers decided not to tell him the news at once, in case he should die of a broken heart.  On the pretext of warding off the evil effects of a dream, they placed him in a vat filled with the four kinds of sweet (catumadhura) and broke the sad news gently to him.  He immediately fainted, and it was not till they put him in two other vats and repeated the tidings that he realised their implication (DA.ii.605-6).  He forthwith gave himself up to great lamentation and despair, "like a madman," calling to mind the Buddha's various virtues and visiting various places associated in his mind with the Buddha.  Later he sent messengers to claim his share of the Buddha's relics, and when he obtained them he prolonged the rites held in their honour till the arahants had to seek Sakka's aid to make the king take the relics away to Rājagaha, where he erected over them a stone thupa (DA.ii.610).  Two months afterwards, when the first Council was held, he gave the undertaking his royal patronage and assisted the monks who took part in it with all his power (Sp.i.10-11; DA.i.8-9).[/p][p][/p][p]Several incidents connected with Ajātasattu's reign are mentioned in the books.[/p][p]Bimbisāra had married a sister of Pasenadi, and when he was killed she died of grief.[/p][p]The revenue of a Kāsī village had been given to her by her father, Mahākosala, as part of her dowry, but after Bimbisāra's murder, Pasenadi refused to continue it.  Thereupon Ajātasattu declared war on his uncle.  Before this, uncle and nephew seem to have been on very friendly terms.  Once Ajātasattu sent Pasenadi a wonderful piece of foreign fabric, sixteen cubits long and eight broad, mounted on a pole to serve as a canopy.  This Pasenadi gave to Ananda (M.ii.116).  [/p][p][/p][p]At first he was victorious in three battles, but, later, he was defeated by Pasenadi, who followed the military advice of an old monk, the Elder Dhanuggahatissa; Ajātasattu was taken captive with his army.  On giving an undertaking not to resort to violence again, he was released, and to seal the friendship, Pasenadi gave him his daughter Vajirā as wife, and the revenue of the disputed village was gifted to her as bath-money (S.i.82-5; J.ii.403-4; Avas.  54-7; J.iv.343f.; DhA.iii.259.).[/p][p]Ajātasattu evidently took his reverses very unsportingly.  (See the Haritamāta Jātaka, J.ii.237f.)[/p][p]Later, when through the treachery of Pasenadi's minister, Dīgha Kārāyana, his son Vidūdabha usurped the throne, Pasenadi, finding himself deserted, went towards Rājagaha to seek Ajātasattu's help, but on the way he died of exposure and Ajātasattu gave him burial (See Pasenadi).[/p][p][/p][p]About a year before the Buddha's death, Ajātasattu sent his chief minister and confidant, the brahmin Vassakāra, to the Buddha to intimate to him his desire to make war on the Vajjians and to find out what prediction the Buddha would make regarding his chances of victory.  The Buddha informed the brahmin that the Vajjians practised the seven conditions of welfare which they had learnt from him, and that they were therefore invincible (D.ii.72f).  The Samyutta Nikāya mentions the Buddha as saying that the time would come when the Vajjians would relinquish their strenuous mode of living and that then would come Ajātasattu's chance.  (S.ii.268).  According to the Jainas, Ajātasattu fought with Cedaga, king of Vesāli, for the possession of an extraordinary elephant (Hoernle on Ājivaka in ERE i.).  [/p][p][/p][p]This chance came about three years later, for by the treachery of Vassakāra, he succeeded in sowing dissension among the leading families of Vesāli.  Having thus weakened them, he swooped down upon the place with an overwhelming force and completely destroyed it (For details see Licchavi).  Rumours are mentioned of King Candappajjota making preparations for a war on Ajātasattu to avenge the death of his friend Bimbisāra, but no mention is made of actual fighting (M.iii.7; MA.ii.853; see also Buddhist India, p.13).[/p][p][/p][p]Of the end of Ajātasattu's reign the books mention very little except that he was killed by his son Udaya or Udāyībhadda (Mhv.iv.l), who had been born on the day that Bimbisāra died as a result of his tortures (DA.i.137).[/p][p]We are told that Ajātasattu had feared that his son might kill him and had therefore secretly hoped that Udaya would become a monk (DA.i.153).  Ajātasattu's reign lasted thirty-two years (Mhv.ii.31; but see Geiger's Introd.  to Mhv.  trans.  xi ff.; also Samaddar: Glories of Magadha, 17, n.  3; also Vincent Smith: Early History of India, pp.  [st2:frenchfranctoeuro ProductID="26 ff"]26 ff[/st2:frenchfranctoeuro].).[/p][p]It was he who built the fortress of Pālātiputta, which later became the capital of Magadha.[/p][p][/p][p]We do not know what Ajātasattu's real name was.  By the Jains he is called Kunika or Konika, which again is probably a nickname (Dial.  ii.79, n.1).  The title Vedehiputta which always accompanies his name probably means "son of the Videha lady." At the time of Buddhaghosa there seems to have been much confusion about the meaning of this word.  According to Buddhaghosa (DA.i.139) Vedehi means "wise." There seems to have been another explanation which Buddhaghosa rejects - that Ajātasattu was the son of the Videha queen.  Videhi was probably the maiden, family, or tribal (not personal) name of his mother.  According to a Tibetan authority her personal name was Vāsavī, and she was called Videhi because she was from Videha (Rockhill, p.  63. In the Pali books he is often referred to as Kosaladevī).  (See also Vedehikā.)[/p][p][/p][p]Two explanations are given of the epithet Ajātasattu.  According to Buddhaghosa he was so called because the soothsayers predicted his enmity to his father even before his birth, and a story is told of how his mother, at the time of his conception, had a longing to drink blood from Bimbisāra's right hand.  The longing was satisfied, but when the queen heard the soothsayer's prediction, she tried, in many ways, to bring about a miscarriage.  (DA.i.133ff.; J.iii.121-2) The park where she tried to bring about the miscarriage was called Maddakucchi (SA.i.61).  [/p][p][/p][p]In this she was prevented by the king.  Later both parents grew to be very fond of him.  There is a story of the prince, holding his father's finger, visiting Jotika's marvellous palace and thinking that his father was a fool for not taking Jotika's wealth.  When he became king he acquired Jotika's palace.  (DhA.iv.211 and 222f).  As a boy he used to visit the Buddha with his father (DA.i.152).[/p][p]To show Bimbisāra's love for the babe, an incident is mentioned of how once, when the prince was yelling with pain because of a boil on his finger, the nurses took him to the king who was then holding court.  To soothe the child, the king put the offending finger in his mouth, where the boil burst.  Unable to spit the pus out the king swallowed it (DA.i.138).  The other explanation is that also found in the Upanisads, (Dial.ii.78f ) and this is probably the correct one.  It says that the word means "he against whom there has arisen no foe."[/p][p][/p][p]According to the Digha Commentary, (i.237-8) Ajātasattu was born in the Lohakumbhiya niraya after his death.  He will suffer there for 60,000 years, and later will reach nibbana as a Pacceka Buddha named Viditavisesa (Vijitāvī).  Ajātasattu's crime of parricide is often given as an example of an upacchedaka-kamma which has the power of destroying the effect of meritorious deeds (E.g., AA.i.369).  He is also mentioned as the worst kind of parricide (E.g.  AA.i.335).[/p][p][/p][p]Ajātasattu seems to have been held in hatred by the Niganthas.  The reason is probably that given in the Dhammapada Commentary (iii.66f), where it is said that when Moggallāna had been killed by thieves, spies were sent out by the king to discover the murderers.  When arrested, the murderers confessed that they had been incited by the Niganthas.  The king thereupon buried five hundred Niganthas waist-deep in pits dug in the palace court and had their heads ploughed off.[/p][hr]</entry>

The second of these verses is elsewhere (S.i.156) attributed to Abhibhū, chief disciple of Sikhī Buddha.

The Buddha questioned Arittha regarding this, and when Arittha acknowledged that such was his view, the Buddha rebuked him as having not even a spark of illumination regarding the Dhamma and the Vinaya.[/p][p]Foolish persons, who have learned the Doctrine by heart but fail to study its import, quite miss the real meaning of their memorising and find no joy in it, using it solely as a means of stricture on others or of bandying verbal quotations; they are like a man who, finding a serpent, seizes it by its tail or coils and gets bitten, meeting thereby death or deadly hurt.

Only in the Chronicles and the Commentaries is the word used as the title of a third Pitaka (See the discussion of this in DA.i.15, 18f).  In the Canon itself (E.g., Vin.i.64; iii.144; iv.344) the word means "special dhamma," i.e.  the Doctrine pure and simple (without admixture of literary treatment or personalities, etc.), and is sometimes coupled with the word abhivinaya (E.g., D.iii.267; M.i.272).  [/p][p][/p][p]It has been suggested (New Pāli Dict.  s.v.) that, as the word abhidhamma standing alone is not found either in the Sutta Nipāta, the Samyutta, or the Anguttara, and only once or twice in the Digha and Majjhima, it probably came into use only towards the end of the period in which the four great Nikāyas grew up (See Dial.iii.199 on a possible origin of the Adhidhamma).[/p][p][/p][p]The Mahāsanghikas refused to include the Abhidhamma in the Pitakas at all, as they did not regard it as the word of the Buddha.  (Dpv.v.32-8).[/p][p][/p][p]According to the Dighabhānakas the Abhidhamma Pitaka also included the whole of the Khuddaka Nikāya except the Cariyāpitaka, Apadāna and Buddhavamsa (DA.i.15).[/p][p][/p][p]According to another division, the five Nikāyas are not divisions of the Dhamma but of the whole Canon, and in the fifth are included both the Vinaya and the Abhidhamma (DA.i.28).[/p][p][/p][p]There is a legend recorded by Buddhaghosa that the Abhidhamma was first preached by the Buddha in Tāvatimsa at the foot of the Pāricchataka tree, when he was seated on Sakka's throne, during his visit to his mother in Tāvatimsa.  Later it was taught by him to Sāriputta on the banks of the Anotatta Lake, whither Sāriputta had gone to minister to the Buddha during the latter's visit to Tāvatimsa (VibhA.  p.1; AA.i.71, etc.).[/p][p][/p][p]The legend further relates that after the Enlightenment the Buddha spent the fourth week in the Ratanaghara, revolving in his mind the intricate doctrines of the Abhidhamma in all their details (J.i.78).[/p][p]According to the Cullavagga version of the Councils (Chaps.  xi.  and xii; but see DA.i.15 contra) the Abhidhamma Pitaka was not rehearsed at either Council.[/p][p][/p][p]The fact that the Abhidhamma is not mentioned in the suttas and that only Dhamma and Vinaya are usually referred to, only proves that at one time the Abhidhamma did not form a separate Pitaka.  As a matter of fact, it is not held even by the commentators to be the word of the Buddha in the same sense as the suttas.  One section of it, the Kathāvatthu (but see Kathāvatthu), was taught only at the Third Council.[/p][p][/p][p]As far as we know, the seven books of the Abhidhamma are peculiar to the Theravādins, though there is evidence that other schools, chiefly the Vaibhāsikas (Sarvāstivādins) and the Sautrāntikas, held the Abhidhamma books sacred.  See Tārānātha: Geschichte des Buddhismus (56) 156 (296).[/p][p][/p][p]As far as the contents of the Abhidhamma are concerned, they do not form a systematic philosophy, but are a special treatment of the Dhamma as found in the Sutta-Pitaka.  Most of the matter is psychological and logical; the fundamental doctrines mentioned or discussed are those already propounded in the suttas and, therefore, taken for granted.  For a discussion of the contents see article on Abhidhamma in ERE.  [/p][p][/p][p]Apart from the Commentaries on the seven books, an exegetical work on the whole Pitaka, called the Abhidhamma Mūlatīkā, was written by Ananda Vanaratanatissa of the Vanavāsī school in Ceylon.[/p][p][/p][p]The Tīkā was evidently based on Buddhaghosa's Commentaries, but Ananda occasionally dissents from Buddhaghosa.

This sutta is to warn Rāhula against the use of lies (MA.ii.635f.; AA.i.145; ii.547).[/p][p][/p][p]The Ambalatthika-Rāhulovāda Sutta is among the portions of scripture mentioned in the Bhābrā Edict of Asoka as being essentially worthy of study by all monks (See Mookerji: Asoka, p.119) (v.l.  Ambalatthiya°).[/p][hr]</entry>

For seven days he enjoyed her company to the exclusion of all else, but on the seventh day she died.  Disconsolate, he sought comfort from the Buddha, who assuaged his grief (DhA.iii.166-67; cf.  the story of Santati).[/p][p]The Apadāna (ii.502-4) gives the story of his past.  He had been a brahmin of Hamsavatī, skilled in the Vedas; having heard the Buddha Padumuttara preach, he was converted and joined the Order, where he spent his time singing the greatness of the Buddha.[/p][p]The Theragāthā Commentary (i.83-4) quotes, in his story, some verses in the Apadāna, which in the Apadāna itself are ascribed to a Thera Ketakapupphiya.  They state that he offered a ketaka-flower to the Buddha Vipassī, Perhaps Ketakapupphiya was the title of another Thera, whose real name was Abhaya, and hence the stories were confused (ii.449-50).[/p][p]See also Abhaya (3).[/p][hr][p][b]3.

On one occasion he comes with another Licchavi, Pandita Kumāraka, to Ananda in the Kūtāgārasālā in Vesāli, and discusses with him certain views held by Nigantha Nātaputta.  Ananda teaches him the Buddha's three Ways of purification (For details see A.i.220-2).  On another occasion he visits the Buddha, again at Vesāli, with the Licchavi Sālha; the latter asks the Buddha's views on purity of morals and self-mortification.  The Buddha tells him of the Ariyan Way and explains its implications by various similes (See A.ii.202-4).  We are not told that either of them became converts on this occasion.[/p][hr][p][b]4.

  <entry>[div class="huge"]Abhayagiri[/div][p]A celebrated monastic establishment on the north side of Anurādhapura, consisting of a vihāra and a mighty thūpa.  Only the thūpa now stands.  It was built by King Vattagāmani Abhaya on the site of the ancient Titthārāma, 217 years, 10 months and 10 days after the founding of the Mahāvihāra (Mhv.xxxvii.78-83).  Tradition states that when the king was fleeing from the Tamils he passed the Titthārāma on his way, and the Nigantha Giri, who then lived there, made insulting remarks about him.  The king vowed, if he were returned to the throne, to build a vihāra on that spot (Mhv.xxxvii.43-4); he fulfilled his vow, and the name of the vihāra was a combination of his own name and of that of the Nigantha.  The monastery was given in charge of the Thera Mahātissa of Kuppikala and of two other monks, Kuppikala having befriended the king in his misfortunes.[/p][p][/p][p]The vihāra advanced rapidly in wealth and in power, but quite soon the monks seceded from the Mahāvihāra fraternity because, according to the Mahāvamsa (Mhv.xxxvii.95ff), an incumbent of the Mahāvihāra, Mahātissa by name, was expelled from the monastery for frequenting lay families.  His disciple, Bahalamassutissa, went in anger to Abhayagiri and formed a separate faction.[/p][p]A Sinhalese chronicle, the Nikāya Sahgraha (pp.11, 12; also P.L.C.42), states that these dissentients were soon after joined by a body of Vajjiputtaka monks from the Pallārāma in India, under the leadership of a teacher called Dhammaruci, and the sect which they together founded in Ceylon became known as the Dhammaruci Nikāya, with headquarters in Abhayagiri.[/p][p][/p][p]For quite a long while the two fraternities, that of the Mahāvihāra and that of the Abhayagiri, seem to have lived in amity, alike enjoying the munificence of patrons (Ibid., 52f.; Mhv.xxxv.20, 57, 119-22; xxxvi.7-14).  Thus, Gajabāhukagāmani raised the height of Abhayuttara-thūpa (as the thūpa at Abhayagiri seems to have been called) and made the Gāmanitissa-tank to be used for the cultivation of land for the maintenance of the vihara (Ibid., xxxv.119-22); Kanitthatissa built a splendid structure in the same vihāra for the Thera Mahānāga; it was called the Ratanapāsāda (xxxvi.7, 8.).[/p][p][/p][p]But in the reign of Vohārakatissa, the Abhayagiri monks openly adopted the heretical Vaitulya Pitaka (of the Mahāyānists see Mhv.  trans.  259, n.2).  An inquiry was held by the king with the help of his minister Kapila, the heretical books were burnt and the monks of Abhayagiri disgraced (Mhv.xxxvi.40-1).[/p][p][/p][p]Soon afterwards, however, the heretics won over the king Mahāsena to their side and destroyed the establishment of the Mahāvihāra, carrying away all the materials to Abhayagiri (P.L.C.  53; Mhv.xxxvii.10-16).  Later, Mahāsena repented of his ways, burnt the books of the Abhayagiri monks and transferred his patronage to the Mahāvihāra.  But the Abhayagiri fraternity must soon have recovered its prestige, for we find Mahāsena's successor, Sirimeghavanna, planting a bodhi tree (called Tissavasabha) (Cv.trans.  i.9, n.3) in Abhayagiri and surrounding it with a stone terrace ((Cv.xxxvii.91)).  A few years later both Mahānāma (409-31) and his queen became active supporters of Abhaya Giri (Cv.xxxvii.212).  Dhātusena is stated to have enlarged the Abhayuttara-vihāra (Cv.xxxviii.61), and Silākāla is credited with several benefactions to the vihāra and its bodhi tree (Cv.xli.31-2); Mahānāga gave the weaver's village of Jambela to the Uttaravihāra (another name for Abhayagiri; see Cv.  trans.  i.8, n.2; 61, n.6.); Aggabodhi I.  built a bathing-tank there (Cv.xlii.28), while his successor, Aggabodhi II., built the Dāthāggabodhi house, so called after himself and his queen (Cv.xlii.63-5).[/p][p][/p][p]In the monastery at Abhayagiri there seems to have been a stone image of the Buddha, referred to under various names, Silāsambuddha, Kālasela, Kālasatthā, Silāsatthā and Silāmayamuninda.  Cv.xxxix.7; xxxviii.65; 61.2; see also vv.51, 77, 87. There was also in Abhayagiri another image called the Abhiseka (q.v.).  [/p][p][/p][p]It was evidently held peculiarly sacred.  Buddhadāsa placed a nāgamani in its eye (Cv.xxxvii.123); this was soon lost, and we find Dhātusena replacing it, adorning and decorating the statue in various ways (For details see Cv.xxxviii.62ff).  Silāmeghavanna had it restored and redecorated and made provision for its maintenance (Cv.xliv.68).  The same king, we are told, attempted to carry out a reform of the Abhayagiri monks, but this attempt ultimately brought disaster on him (Cv.xliv.75ff).  Jetthatissa gave to the vihāra the village of Mahādāragiri (Cv.xliv.96).  Dāthopatissa built the Kappūra-parivena attached to the vihāra, and also a monastery Tiputthulla, encroaching on the precincts of the Mahāvihāra, notwithstanding the protests of the monks belonging to the[/p][p]Latter (Cv.xlv.29ff).  Aggabodhi VII, added the Sabhattudesabhoga (Cv.xlviii.64), and Mahinda II.  the Mahālekha-parivena as well as the many-storeyed Ratanapāsāda with its costly ornamentation (Cv.xlviii.135-40; see also Geiger's trans.  123, n.2).[/p][p]Sena I.  built the Virankurārāma and gave it to the Mahāsanghikas (Cv.l.68-9), while his consort, Sanghā, erected a dwelling house, Mahindasena (Cv.l.79), and his courtier, Uttara, yet another dwelling house, called Uttarasena, for the maintenance of which he provided.  Two other courtiers, Vajira and Rakkhasa, built two dwelling houses, called respectively Vajirasenaka and Rakkhasa (Cv.l.83).[/p][p][/p][p]In the reign of Sena II.  the Pamsukulika monks, who till then had evidently lived in Abhayagiri (Cv.  trans.  i.108, n.1), separated and formed special groups.  Sanghā, queen of Udaya II., erected and endowed the building known as the Sanghasenapabbata (Cv.li.86-7).  Kassapa IV.  built a pāsāda bearing his name and assigned to it a village (Cv.lii.13; Cv.trs.  i.162, n.4), while his successor, Kassapa V., erected the Bhandikā-parivena and the Silāmeghapabbata, endowing each with a village (Cv.lii.58-9).[/p][p]Sena III.  spent 40,000 kahāpanas for a stone paving round the cetiya.  The Abhayagiri monks befriended both Vijayabāhu I.  (then known as Kitti) and his brother, and out of gratitude Vijayabāhu built the Uttaramūla-parivena, which was probably attached to the vihara itself (Cv.lvii.18, 23).[/p][p][/p][p]In the reign of Parakkamabāhu I., when that monarch had established himself on the throne, it is said that he tried to reform the monks of the Abhayagiri, but he found the task hopeless (Cv.lxxviii.21ff).  He found that the Abhayagiri-thūpa had been destroyed by the vandalism of the Tamils, and he had it restored to a height of 160 cubits (Cv.lxxviii.98).  When Anurādhapura was finally abandoned, Abhayagiri fell into ruin and decay, the monastery being completely destroyed.[/p][p][/p][p]It is clear that even at the outset there was considerable rivalry between the monks of Abhayagiri and those of the Mahāvihāra.  The rivalry seems originally to have been mainly personal, but it later developed into differences in doctrinal opinion.  Of the exact nature of these latter we have no information, owing, chiefly, to the book-burnings carried out by pious kings in the excess of their zeal for the purity of the Faith.  For the same reason we are unable to ascertain what part, if any, the Abhayagiri fraternity played in literary activity.  It has been suggested, however, that both the Jātakatthakathā (P.L.C.124, 125) and the Sahassavatthuppakarana (P.L.C.128), another compilation of tales, were the work of the Abhayagiri monks.[/p][p][/p][p]Fa-Hsien evidently spent the two years of his stay in Ceylon with the Abhayagiri fraternity because the books he took away with him were those of the unorthodox schools.  According to him, there were, at this time, 5,000 monks in Abhayagiri (Fa Hsien's Travels, 67ff).[/p][p][/p][p]In the chronicles Abhayagiri is referred to under several names Abhayuttara, Abhayavihāra, Abhayācala and Uttaravihāra.[/p][hr]</entry>

  <entry>[div class="huge"]Alāta[/div][p]A minister and general of Angati, King of Videha.  He is described as wise, smiling, a father of sons and full of experience.  When Angati consulted his ministers as to ways and means of finding diversion for himself and his subjects, Alāta's counsel was that they should set out to battle with a countless host of men.  The suggestion of another minister, Vijaya, was that the king should visit some samana or brahmin, and this idea it was that won the king's approval.  Thereupon Alāta persuaded Angati to visit the Ājīvika Guna of the Kassapa family, who evidently enjoyed Alāta's patronage.  When Guna preached his doctrine that good and evil actions were alike fruitless, he was supported by Alāta, who stated that in a previous birth he had been Pingala, a cowkilling huntsman in Benares, and that he had committed many sins for which, however, he had never suffered any evil consequences.[/p][p]Later, Angati's daughter Rujā explains that Alāta's present prosperity is the result of certain past acts of righteousness and that time will eventually bring him suffering on account of his evil deeds.  Alāta himself, she says, is not aware of this because he can remember only one previous birth, while she herself can recall seven.  See the Mahā Nārada-Kasappa Jātaka (J.vi.222ff).[/p][p]Alāta was a previous birth of Devadatta (J.vi.255).[/p][p]In the text he is sometimes (E.g., pp.221, 230) also called Alātaka, perhaps for the purposes of metre.[/p][hr]</entry>

The Buddha refused to recognise the substitute, and Nandā was compelled to go herself.  As she listened to the Buddha preaching, he, by his magic power, conjured up a beautiful woman and showed her becoming aged and fading, causing anguish to arise in Nandā's heart.  At the opportune moment, the Buddha drove home the truth of the impermanence of beauty.

The elephant, in gratitude, spent the rest of his life working for them, and, before his death, he enlisted his son, white in colour, magnificent and high-bred, in their service.  One day a half-dry cake of the young one's dung was carried into the river by the flood (we are told that noble animals never dung or stale in water), and, floating down, stuck near the bathing place of the king's elephants in Benares.  The royal elephants, scenting the noble animal, refused to enter the water and fled.  Having discovered the reason for their behaviour, the king decided to obtain the animal for himself, and going up-stream in a raft, he saw the carpenters and the white elephant working for them.  The merchants agreed to give him to the king, but the elephant refused to move till the carpenters were adequately compensated.  The animal was taken in procession to the city and with his help the king became supreme ruler over India.[/p][p]In course of time the Queen Consort bore a son to the king, but the king died before his birth.  The Kosala king thereupon laid siege to Benares, but desisted from attack for seven days, astrologers having predicted that at the end of that time the child would be born.  The men of Benares had agreed to surrender unless the baby proved to be a boy.  After seven days the queen bore a son named Alīnacitta, and the in habitants of Benares gave battle to the Kosala king.  The queen, being told that they were in danger of defeat, dressed the baby and took him to the elephant for protection.  The elephant had been kept in ignorance of the king's death, lest he himself should die of a broken heart.  But, on hearing the news, he sallied forth into battle and soon brought back the Kosala king as captive.[/p][p]Alīnacitta became, in due course, king over the whole of Jambudīpa (J.ii.17-23).

Indra is most revered of the gods (Sn.vs.316).  He is free from old age and death, and is, therefore, the happiest type of king (Sn.vs.515), a condition that could be attained by sacrifice (Sn.vs.517).  Alone he conquered the  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/asura,Asuras')"]Asuras[/a] (J.iv.347; he is therefore called Asurinda and Asurādhipa ; see Asura).  He is spoken of, as the lord of victors (jayatam pati) (J.v.322), and he is the embodiment of the greatest valour (Mhv.xxx.10).[/p][p][/p][p]Sometimes he visits the earth in disguise (J.v.33).  He is also represented as punishing people guilty of heinous crimes; with his thunderbolt he smites them (DhA.iv.105).[/p][p][/p][p]The scene of his pleasures is in the Nandana pleasance (J.v.158), and his is the ideal enjoyment of pleasure, surrounded by friends (J.v.506; Sn.v.679) and by adoring wives (J.vi.240).  The gods of Tāvatimsa are called Inda-purohitā, because, with Inda as their chief, they seek to promote the welfare of gods and men (J.vi.127; the Tāvatimsa gods are also described as being Sa-Indakā, ibid., 568).  [/p][p][/p][p]Inda is called Tidivapuravara and Suravaratara (D.iii.176).  His capital is Masakkasāra (J.vi.271; but see Amarāvatī).[/p][p]In the sacrifice the palāsayatthi (Butea shoot), used by the sacrificing priest, is described as Indra's right hand (J.vi.212).[/p][p]Indra's gotta, or clan, is the Kosiya (J.vi.501) ; he is called Vatrabhū in reference to his victory over Vatra (Skt.  Vrtra) (J.v.153), and mention is made of his thunderbolt, the Indavajira (J.i.354) ; thus he is called Vajirahattha (D.ii.259; DA.ii.689).  The sound of Indra's thunderbolt striking its victim, surpasses all other sounds by its intensity, its volume and its fearfulness (UdA.67); no obstruction can stop the progress of Indra's Vajira and it never misses its mark; it is avirajjhanaka (VibhA.333).[/p][p]After his victory over the Asuras, images of him were made (Indapatimā) and placed round Cittakūta to frighten the Asuras away, in case they attempted to retrieve their lost honour (J.vi.125-6; see also J.i.203-4; DhA.i.280).[/p][p]To be born into the company of Indra (Indasahavyatā) is considered very fortunate (E.g., J.v.411).[/p][p][/p][p]A species of coral red insect (kimi), noticeable after rain, are called Indagopakā.

In order to emphasise to her audience the fact that she was reporting the Buddha's words and not her own, she prefaced each sutta with the phrase quoted above.  There was no need to describe any special circumstances in which the suttas were preached, because they were familiar to Khujjuttarā's audience.[/p][p][/p][p]At the Rājagaha Council, Ananda repeated the suttas to the Assembly and they were gathered into this collection.[/p][p][/p][p]Itivuttaka is also the name given to one of the nine divisions (anga) into which the Buddha's preaching is divided and it is defined as follows: vuttam h'etam Bhagavatā ti ādinayappavattā dasuttarasatam suttantā Itivuttakam ti veditabbam (DA.i.24).[/p][p][/p][p]In the scholiast of the Kummāsapinda Jātaka (J.iii.409; l.21)), the Itivuttaka is mentioned in the plural (Itivuttakesu) and a sutta is quoted from it, extolling the virtues of generosity.

Some relatives of hers came to the house and discovering what had happened, released the servant.  She went to the monastery where her mistress was listening to the Buddha's sermon and proclaimed aloud the wrong done to her.  The Buddha, thereupon, pointed out the folly of doing evil in the hope that it would not be found out.  We are told that both the woman and her husband became Sotāpanna at the end of the sermon.

In the first year of his reign he incurred the displeasure of the powerful Lambakannas and was deprived of his throne and taken captive.  It is said that the king was rescued from prison by his state elephant and that he escaped to Rohana.  Three years later he gave battle to the Lambakannas at Kapallakkhanda and massacred most of them.  He had the noses and toes of the rest cut off as punishment.[/p][p]He was succeeded by his son Candamukha Siva.  To his state elephant, who had helped him, he gave the tract of land called Hatthibhoga.  During his exile in Rohana, Ilanaga built two tanks, the Tissa and the Dūra, and restored the Nāgamahāvihāra, which he gave to Mahāpaduma, thera of Tulādhāra, who had preached to him the Kapi Jātaka.

When the Buddha was staying at Indakūta, the yakkha questioned him as to how the soul finds its material counterpart.  The Buddha, in reply, described how the embryo evolved into its final shape by the laws of physical growth and not by a soul's fiat (S.i.206).[/p][p]Buddhaghosa says (SA.i.231) that the yakkha was an animist (puggalavādin).[/p][p][/p][p][b]2. Indaka[/b].-A deva.  He had been a youth who gave a spoonful of food to Anuruddha.  In consequence he was born in Tāvatimsa as a deva of great power and majesty.  When the Buddha went to Tāvatimsa to preach the Abhidhamma, in the assembly of the gods who gathered there, those of lesser powers had to yield place to their superiors.  Thus Ankura (q.v.), who, at the start, was very near the Buddha, found himself twelve leagues away.  But not so Indaka; the power of his merit was very great and no deva was mighty enough to displace him; he had been lucky in the recipient of his gift.  Ankura's generosity, much more lavish than Indaka's, had been bestowed on men who were not holy.  Such was the explanation the Buddha gave in the assembly of the gods, on seeing the discrepancy between the positions of the two devas, Indaka surpassing the other in ten qualities.  (Pv.pp.27f; PvA.136-8; DhA.iii.219-20; 80-1).[/p][p]In one place, in the Petavatthu (p.28, v.69), Indaka is called a yakkha, but the Commentary (p.139) says it means deva-putta.

The further question is asked as to whom, when given, does a gift bear much fruit.  To the virtuous, irrespective of class, says the Buddha, and he instances the case of a youth skilled in war as opposed to one who is untrained and unskilled, no matter what his social status.  The Buddha proceeds to describe the qualities which are possessed by the virtuous man (S.i.98f).[/p][p]The Commentary (SA.i.129f) describes this interview as a public one, taking place before a large audience, among whom are teachers of rival schools, "scratching the ground with their feet."

For, we are told that at the foundation ceremony of the Mahā Thūpa in Anurādhapura, twelve thousand monks were present from Isipatana led by the Elder Dhammasena (Mhv.xxix.31).[/p][p] [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/h/hiuen_tsang,Hiouen Thsang')"]Hiouen Thsang[/a] (Beal: Records of the Western World, ii.45ff ) found, at Isipatana, fifteen hundred monks studying the Hīnayāna.  In the enclosure of the Sanghārāma was a vihāra about two hundred feet high, strongly built, its roof surmounted by a golden figure of the mango.  In the centre of the vihāra was a life-size statue of the Buddha turning the wheel of the Law.  To the south-west were the remains of a stone stupa built by  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/asoka,Asoka')"]Asoka[/a].  The Divy.  (389-94) mentions Asoka as intimating to Upagupta his desire to visit the places connected with the Buddha's activities, and to erect thupas there.  Thus he visited Lumbinī, Bodhimūla, Isipatana, Migadāya and Kusinagara; this is confirmed by Asoka's lithic records, e.g.  Rock Edict, viii.[/p][p]In front of it was a stone pillar to mark the spot where the Buddha preached his first sermon.  Near by was another stupa on the site where the Pañcavaggiyas spent their time in meditation before the Buddha's arrival, and another where five hundred Pacceka Buddhas entered Nibbāna.  Close to it was another building where the future Buddha Metteyya received assurance of his becoming a Buddha.[/p][p]Hiouen Thsang quotes the Nigrodhamiga Jātaka (J.i.145ff) to account for the origin of the Migadāya.  According to him the Deer Park was the forest gifted by the king of Benares of the Jātaka, where the deer might wander unmolested.[/p][p]According to the Udapāna Jātaka (J.ii.354ff ) there was a very ancient well near Isipatana which, in the Buddha's time, was used by the monks living there.[/p][p]In past ages Isipatana sometimes retained its own name, E.g., in the time of Phussa Buddha (Bu.xix.18), Dhammadassī (BuA.182) and Kassapa (BuA.218).  Kassapa was born there (ibid., 217).[/p][p]But more often Isipatana was known by different names (for these names see under those of the different Buddhas).  Thus in Vipassī's time it was known as Khema-uyyāna.  It is the custom for all Buddhas to go through the air to Isipatana to preach their first sermon.  Gotama, however, walked all the way, eighteen leagues, because he knew that by so doing he would meet Upaka, the Ajivaka, to whom he could be of service (DA.ii.471).[/p][p]Isipatana is identified with the modern Saranath, six miles from Benares.  Cunningham (Arch.

  <entry>[div class="huge"]Iccānanagala[/div][p]A brahmin village in the Kosala country.  It was while staying in the woodland thicket (vanasanda) there that the Buddha preached the Ambattha Sutta (D.i.87).  From this sutta, the village would seem to have been near Pokkharasādi's domain of Ukkatthā.  It was the residence of "Mahāsāla" brahmins.  The Sutta Nipāta (p.115) (which spells the name as Icchānankala) mentions several eminent brahmins who lived there, among them Cankī, Tārukkha, Pokkarasāti, Jānussoni and Todeyya.  [/p][p][/p][p]There were also two learned youths, Vāsettha and Bharadvāja at Icchānankala, who, finding it impossible to bring their discussion to a conclusion, sought the Buddha, then staying in the village.  Their interview with the Buddha is recorded in the Vāsettha Sutta (Ibid., 115ff.; M ii.146ff).  Buddhaghosa (SnA.ii.462) says that learned brahmins of Kosala, deeply versed in the Vedas, were in the habit of meeting together from time to time (once in six months, MA.ii.796) at Icchānangala in order to recite the Vedas and discuss their interpretation.  These brahmins met at Ukkatthā, under Pokkharasāti, when they wished to cleanse their caste (jātisodhanattham), and at Icchānankala in order to revise their Vedic hymns (mante sodhetu-kāmā), MA.ii.796.[/p][p][/p][p]According to the Samyutta Nikāya (v.325), the Buddha once stayed for three months in the jungle thicket at Icchānangala, in almost complete solitude, visited only by a single monk who brought him his food.  But from the Anguttara Nikāya (iii.30f.; cf.  iii.341 and iv.340ff), it would appear that the Buddha was not left to enjoy the solitude which he desired, for we are told that the residents of Icchānangala, having heard of the Buddha's visit, came to him in large numbers and created a disturbance by their shouts.  The Buddha had to send Nāgita, who was then his personal attendant, to curb the enthusiasm of his admirers.[/p][hr]</entry>

He was an infidel and a miser, never giving away any of his wealth nor enjoying it himself.[/p][p]For seven generations his ancestors had been generous, but Illisa burnt down the almonry and drove away the poor from his house.[/p][p]Once, at the sight of a yokel drinking, with a piece of dried fish as a relish, Illisa was sorely tempted to drink himself.  For a long time he fought the temptation, but he sickened with longing, and having sent a slave with a single penny to the tavern, he got some toddy; he ordered the slave to put the jar of spirits in a thicket by the riverside so that he might drink unseen.[/p][p]Meanwhile Illisa's father, who had been born as Sakka, having learnt, as a result of investigations, that his son had become a miser, came down to earth to wean him from his folly.  Assuming in every detail the form of Illisa, he entered the king's palace and offered all the wealth of Illisa to the king.  On the offer being refused, he went to Illisa's house and gave orders to the servants to throw open all the treasure chambers and give the wealth to the poor.  The servants took the disguised Sakka to be Illisa himself, and Illisa's wife, believing her husband's sudden generosity to be due to his drunkenness, acquiesced in the instructions.[/p][p]Among those who profited by this unexpected good fortune was a countryman who had been Illisa's carriage-driver.  Filling the carriage with seven things of value, he set out along the road, passing by the thicket wherein Illisa lay drinking.  The man was singing Illisa's praises, and at mention of his name Illisa came out, and seeing the man going away with his belongings tried to stop him.  But the man, not recognising him, knocked him down and went on his way.  Illisa hurried home but was turned out of his house by the porters, and at length he sought the king.  The king, having heard his story, made enquiries and discovered the existence of two Illisas, alike in every respect, down to the minutest detail, even to a wart on the head.[/p][p]Not even Illisa's wife and children, not even his barber, could distinguish him from the second Illisa.[/p][p]Bereft of all hope, Illisa swoons, Sakka reveals himself and tells Illisa that the wealth is really his and not Illisa's, the latter not having earned it.  He urges Illisa to do good and practise generosity, or he would die, smitten by Indra's thunderbolt.[/p][p]Illisa, taking heed of the warning, becomes a virtuous man (J.i.349ff).[/p][hr]</entry>

By correspondence he became the unseen friend of  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/citta,Citta-gahapati')"]Citta-gahapati[/a] of Macchikāsanda.  The latter once sent him a letter regarding the excellences of the Buddha, and Isidatta, being pleased with the account given of the Buddha's religion, entered the Order under  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/maha_kaccaana,Mahā-Kaccāna')"]Mahā-Kaccāna[/a] and in due course became an arahant.  Later, with Mahā-Kaccāna's leave, he visited the Buddha in the Majjhimadesa and was warmly received by him (ThagA.i.238).  A verse uttered by Isidatta, in response to the Buddha's enquiry regarding his welfare, is recorded in the Therāgāthā (v.120).[/p][p]Isidatta had been a householder in the time of Vipassī Buddha and once, having seen the Buddha walking along the street and being pleased with his demeanour, he gave him an āmoda-fruit (ThagA.  loc.  cit.).  He is, probably, identical with Amodapaliya of the Apadāna (ii.447).[/p][p]According to the Samyutta Nikāya (iv.283-8, also AA.i.210), Isidatta was once staying with a number of senior monks at Macchikāsanda in the Ambātaka grove.  Citta-gahapati invited the monks to a meal.  On this occasion Citta asked a question regarding the Buddha's teaching on the diversity of the elements.  The chief Elder, being unable to answer, remained silent.  Isidatta, though the most junior of the whole company, obtained the chief Elder's permission, and answered the question to the satisfaction of Citta.  Citta likewise asked questions regarding various views, such as the infinity of the world, etc.  At the end of the discourse, Citta discovered, by accident, that the Elder who had preached to him was none other than his unseen friend, Isidatta.  Delighted with the discovery, he invited Isidatta to spend his time at a Macchikāsanda, promising to provide him with all requisites.  But that same day Isidatta left Macchikāsanda and never returned.  Because, says Buddhaghosa (AA.i.210), he did not wish to stay after having been recognised.[/p][hr][p][b]2. Isidatta.[/b]-An equerry or chamberlain (thapati) of Pasenadi, King of Kosala.  Isidatta is always mentioned with Purāna.  Their duty was to look after the ladies of the king's harem when these went riding the elephant into the park.  This often brought them into close contact with the ladies, and they confessed to the Buddha that it was difficult not to have evil thoughts regarding them.[/p][p]Isidatta and Purāna were once at Sādhuka' on some business (their own property, according to Buddhaghosa, SA.i.215).  They heard that the Buddha was having a robe made before starting on his rounds and they waited for an opportunity to talk to him.  When the opportunity came they followed the Buddha and told him how glad they always were when he was near them and how sad when he was away on tour.  The Buddha preaches to them the glory of the homeless life and urges them to put forth energy.  He speaks very appreciatively of their loyalty to him and to his religion and congratulates them on the possession of virtuous qualities, such as sharing all their goods with holy men, a rare quality (S.v.348-52; Netti.  134f).[/p][p]According to the Samyutta Commentary (i.215), Isidatta was a Sakadāgāmī and Purāna a Sotāpanna.[/p][p]In the Dhammacetiya Sutta (M.ii.123f), Pasenadi tells the Buddha how impressed he is by the reverence Isidatta and Purāna show for the Buddha and his teachings.  "They are my carriage-builders," says the king, "and they depend on me for their livelihood and all their honours, yet these men do not serve me as whole-heartedly as they do the Lord."[/p][p]Once the king spent the night in a cramped little house.  Isidatta and Purāna, who were with him, having spent the best part of the night in discussing the Doctrine, lay down to rest with their heads in the direction in which they thought the Buddha to be, and their feet towards the king![/p][p]Isidatta was the uncle of the woman-disciple Migasālā, whose father was Purāna.[/p][p]Purāna is described as a brahmacāri, but not Isidatta, yet, after death, they were both born in Tusita.  Migasālā asks Ananda how it was that people of different characters could have the same rebirth.  A.iii.348f.; v.138f., 143f.  From MA.ii.756, it would appear as if Isidatta was the brahmacāri.  The word cannot here mean "celibate," for Purāna must have had a wife because Migasālā calls him her father (pitā).[/p][p]Isidatta is mentioned by the Buddha among those who had the six qualities that brought realisation of immortality - unwavering loyalty to the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha, Ariyan virtue, wisdom and liberation (A.iii.451).[/p][p]The Anāgata Vamsa (v.58) says that when the future Buddha Metteyya leaves the household life, eighty-four thousand others, led by Isidatta and Purāna, will accompany him.[/p][hr][p][b]3.

  <entry>[div class="huge"]Indriyabhāvanā Sutta[/div][p]Preached at Kajangalā in the Mukheluvana.  When a young brahmin, Uttara, pupil of Pārāpariya, visits the Buddha, the Buddha asks him what was the teaching of Pārāsariya on the development of the indriyas.  It is that a man should neither see forms with his eyes, nor hear words with his ears, says Uttara.  Whereupon the Buddha retorts that in that case the deaf and the blind have reached development.  When Uttara sits silent and discomfited, Ananda intervenes and begs the Buddha to expound his teaching on the subject.  The Buddha agrees and preaches this sutta, with a variety of similes (M.iii.298-302).[/p][p][/p][p]In the Theragāthā Commentary (ii.17) we are told that the thera Pārāpariya (probably identical with Pārāsariya mentioned above) was taught the Indriyabhāvana Sutta by the Buddha.  He learnt it by heart, and pondering over its meaning, attained insight.  The Theragāthā (vv.726ff) gives a summary of the musings of Pārāpariya which lead to his attainment.[/p][p]The only connection between the Sutta and this summary is identity of subject, not identity of treatment.

Near Nārada's hermitage was a river, on the banks of which courtesans used to sit, tempting men.  Nārada saw one of these courtesans, and becoming enamoured of her, forsook his meditations and pined away for lack of food.  Kāladevala, being aware of this, tried to wean him from his desires.  Nārada, however, refused to be comforted, even when his colleagues, Sālissara, Mendissara and Pabbatissara admonished him.  In the end Sarabhanga himself was summoned and Nārada, having listened to the words of his Master, was persuaded to give up his passion.[/p][p]The story was told in reference to a backsliding monk.  He went about for alms with his teachers and instructors but, being their junior, he received very little attention.  Dissatisfied with his food and treatment, he sought his wife of former days.  She provided him with every comfort and gradually tempted him with the desire to become a householder again.  When the monk's fellow-celibates discovered his wish, they took him to the Buddha who preached to him this Jātaka, showing that in a past life, too, he had been sorely tempted by the same woman.  Nārada was identified with the backsliding monk and the courtesan with the wife of his lay-days (J.iii.461-9).[/p][p]The Buddha is stated on this occasion to have preached also the Kandina Jātaka (J.i.153ff), the Rādha Jātaka (J.i.495ff), the Ruhaka Jātaka (J.ii.113ff), the Kanavera Jātaka (J.iii.58ff), the Asanka Jātaka (J.iii.248ff) and the Alambusā Jātaka (J.v.152ff).[/p][p]The Indriya Jātaka is also referred to in the Kāmavilāpa Jātaka (J.ii.443ff), but the connection between the two stories is not clear; perhaps the reference is to another story of the same name.[/p][p]See also Sarabhanga Jātaka.[/p][hr]</entry>

Kassapa I.  restored the buildings and enlarged the grounds.  He also bought villages which he presented to the monastery for its maintenance.  He had two daughters, Bodhī and Uppalavannā, and he gave their names and his own to the vihāra.  When the king wished to hand over the vihāra to the Theravāda monks they refused to accept it, fearing the reproach of the people that it was the work of a parricide.

  <entry>[div class="huge"]Isayo Araññakā (or Gandha) Sutta[/div][p]Long ago, many seers of virtuous conduct lived in leaf huts in a wild forest.  According to Buddhaghosa, they lived in the Himālays (SA.i.265); Vepacitti and Sakka were father- and son-in-law; sometimes they quarrelled, sometimes, as here, they were friends.[/p][p]One day, Sakka and Vepacitti visited them.  Vepacitti entered the hermitage by the principal gate, keeping his shoes on and his sword by his side, thereby insulting the seers and committing sin.  Sakka, on the other hand, went in by the usual entrance, doffing his shoes and sword; with his canopy folded up, he stood to leeward of the seers, rendering them homage with clasped hands.  The seers, addressing Sakka, asked him if he did not feel disgust at their smell, inasmuch as they were humans and he a god.  Sakka answered that the scent of virtuous men is lovely, like unto a wreath of varied blossoms (S.i.226).[/p][hr]</entry>

Having come of age, she was given in marriage to the son of a merchant in Sāketa.[/p][p][/p][p]For one month she lived with him as a devoted wife; then because of her past kamma, her husband became estranged from her, and turned her out of the house.  She was married again with the same result, and a third time to a friar.  Isidāsī's father persuaded him to give up the pilgrim's life; he dwelt with his wife only for a fortnight and refused to stay with her any more.  Isidāsī then met the therī [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/j/j,Jinadattā')"]Jinadattā[/a], whom she entertained to a meal at her house.  Under Jinadattā, Isidāsī joined the Order and became an arahant.[/p][p][/p][p]The Therīgāthā (vv.400-47), which contains forty-seven verses ascribed to her, describes not only her present life, but also her past lives.  She had been a worker in gold in Erakaccha and had committed adultery in that life.  As a result she was born in hell for a long time, and, in subsequent births became an ape, a goat, an ox, a hermaphrodite slave and a carter's daughter.  In this last birth she was sold to a merchant in payment of her father's debts.  When she was sixteen, the merchant's son, Giridāsa, fell in love with her and married her.  He had already one wife, and the new one caused dissension between her and her husband.  Therefore it was that in this life she was hated by her husbands.  This account of her sojourn in samsāra was related by Isidāsī in response to a request by one of her fellow-nuns, Bodhī (ThigA.260ff).[/p][p][/p][p]Mrs.  Rhys Davids thinks (Sisters, Introd.  pp.xxii f) that Isidāsī's verses in the Therīgāthā suggest late literary craft and bear the impress of late literary creation.  The scene is Pātaliputta, and not any of the usual towns mentioned in the Canon, and the name of Isidāsī's sponsor - Jindattā - is, she says, significant.  Perhaps there are traces here of Jainistic influence.[/p][p]In the Dīpavamsa (xviii.9) Isidāsī (Isidāsikā) is mentioned in a list of eminent therīs who were leaders of the Order of bhikkhunis.[/p][hr]</entry>

He witnessed the miracle of the Buddha's acceptance of the Candana-mālā (probably the Candanamālaka), and, having heard the Buddha preach, he became a Sotāpanna.  While still living the life of a householder, a compassionate spirit urged him to give it up.  He entered the Order and soon after became an arahant (ThagA.i.312-3).  [/p][p]The Theragāthās (vv.187-8) contains two verses which he uttered in confessing aññā.  They were the same as were spoken to him by his friendly spirit.  In the time of Vipassī Buddha, he was a householder and did homage to the Buddha's Bodhi-tree with a fan made of sumana-flowers (ThagA.312f).

The seers considered the gods righteous but feared harm from the Asuras.  They went, therefore, to Sambara, lord of the Asuras, and asked him for a pledge of safety; he refused, saying that the seers were followers of Sakka.  The seers thereupon cursed him to suffer everlasting terror.  It is said that that same night Sambara woke up thrice, seized with fright (S.i.227-8).[/p][p]Buddhaghosa (SA.i.266) adds that as a result of this curse, Sambara's mind became deranged and he came to be called Vepacitti (crazy-nerve).[/p][hr]</entry>

When he came of age, he was fishing one day in the Aciravatī, and, casting his net, caught a large golden colour fish.  Yasoja and his companions took the fish to Pasenadi who sent them to the Buddha.  The Buddha told them that the fish had been a wicked monk in the time of Kassapa Buddha, and had since suffered in purgatory, where his mother and sisters still were.  He then preached to them the Kapila Sutta, and Yasoja and his companions, greatly moved, renounced the world (ThagA.i.356f.).[/p][p]The Udāna mentions (Ud.iii.3) how, later, Yasoja and five hundred of his companions went to see the Buddha at Jetavana.  There they stood talking to the monks who lived there and made a great uproar.  The Buddha, sending Ananda to fetch them, asked them to remove themselves from his presence, as they were behaving like fishermen.  Taking his admonition to heart, they returned to the banks of the Vaggumudā in the Vajji country, and there they determined to lead such lives as would commend them to the Buddha.  During the rainy season, they all put forth effort and attained arahantship.  Some time after, the Buddha visited Vesāli during a journey and asked Amanda to send for Yasoja and his friends as he desired to see them.  Ananda sent a message.  When the monks arrived, they found the Buddha lost in meditation, and they, too, seated themselves and entered into samādhi, remaining thus throughout the night.  Amanda could not understand why the Buddha, having sent for Yasoja and his companions, should have sunk into samādhi without greeting them, and three times during the night he tried to remind the Buddha of their arrival; but the Buddha ignored his warnings and in the morning explained to him that it was more joy for them all to live in the bliss of samādhi than to indulge in mere conversation.  It is said in UdA.185 that the Buddha spent the night in samādhi in order to show Yasoja and his companions that he regarded them as equals.[/p][p]It is said (ThagA.i.357) that when Yasoja and the others visited the Buddha at Vesāli, they were very thin and had grown uncomely through their austerities.  The Buddha commended their self denial in a verse, and Yasoja, appreciating the Buddha's praise, uttered two other verses, exalting the love of solitude (Thag.243 5).[/p][p]In the time of Vipassī Buddha Yasoja belonged to a family of park-keepers (ārāmagopakā), and one day seeing the Buddha travel through the air, he gave him a labuja fruit (ThagA.i.356).  In the time of Kassapa Buddha, Yasoja was the leader of a band of five hundred robbers.  They were pursued by the villagers and fled into the forest for safety.  There they saw a monk sitting on a stone and asked him for protection.  He advised them to take the five precepts, and when they had done so, he exhorted them never to violate these precepts even if keeping them meant the loss of their lives.  Soon after, they were captured and killed.  But remembering the monk's admonition at the moment of death, they harboured no hatred against anyone, and after death were reborn in the deva world (UdA.179f).[/p][p]The Vinaya relates (Vin.i.239) how once, when Yasoja was ill, drugs were brought for his use, but as the Buddha had forbidden the use of a special place for storing such things (kappiyabhūmi) they were left out of doors and were partly eaten by vermin, the remainder being carried away by robbers.  When the matter was reported to the Buddha, he allowed the use of a duly chosen kappiyabhūmi.  The Apadāna verses ascribed to Yasoja in the Theragāthā are, in the Apadāna itself, found in two places: one under Labujadāyaka (Ap.ii.409) and the other, with slight variations, under Labujaphaladāyaka.

Two hundred years of human life are but one day to the Yāma devā, and two thousand Years, composed of such days, form their life period (A.i.213; iv.253).  Sirimā, sister of Jīvaka, was born after death in the Yāma world and became the wife of Suyāma, king of[/p][p]Yāmabhavana.  From there she visited the Buddha with five hundred others.  SNA i.244f.; see also VvA.246 for an upāsaka born in the Yāma-world.  In the Hatthipāla Jātaka (J.iv.475) mention is made of four Yāma-devas who were reborn as men.  [/p][p]The meaning of Yāmā is explained in the Commentaries (E.g., VibhA.519; PSA.441) as "those that have attained divine bliss" (dibbam sukham yātā payātā sampattā ti Yāmā).  Other explanations are “misery freed" or "governing gods”.  Compendium, p.138, n.2.[/p][hr][p][b]2. Yāmā.[/b] In some contexts, Yāmā seems to have been derived from Yama, king of the underworld - e.g in such expressions as "Yāmato yāva Akanittham" (From the underworld to the highest heaven).

  <entry>[div class="huge"]Yamaka Sutta[/div][p]The Thera Yamaka held the view that, in so far as a monk has destroyed the āsavas, he is broken up and perishes at the break up of the body and becomes not after death.  Yamaka's colleagues tried to correct this erroneous view (the heresy lies in the implication that "a being is broken up and perishes”; SA.ii.226.) but failed, and so reported him to Sāriputta.  Sāriputta visited Yamaka and argued with him that if it were false to say of anybody that he existed in truth, in reality, even in this very life, how much more so to speak of someone existing or not existing after death.  Yamaka thereupon confessed his error.  Sāriputta further elucidated the matter by using the simile of a man who enters the service of a rich householder with the intent to murder him.  Such a man would always be a murderer, even though his master knew him not to be so.  Even so, the disciple who regards body, etc., as permanent and so on, harbours a murderous view, even though he knows it not as such (S.iii.109ff).  [/p][p]The sutta is often referred to.

He is a good king.[/p][p]In the Jātakas* the Nirayas are particularly mentioned as Yama's abode (Yamakkhaya, Yamanivesana, Yamasādana, etc.); but, more generally, all Samsāra is considered as subject to Yama's rule, and escape from samsāra means escape from Yama's influence, Yama being the god of Death.

  <entry>[div class="huge"]Yamaka pātihāriya[/div][p]The miracle of the "double appearances”.  When the Buddha laid down a rule forbidding the exercise of supernatural powers by monks - following on the miracle performed by Pindola Bhāradvāja (q.v.) - the heretics went about saying that henceforth they would perform no miracles except with the Buddha.  Bimbisāra reported this to the Buddha, who at once accepted the challenge, explaining that the rule was for his disciples and did not apply to himself.  He, therefore, went to Sāvatthi, the place where all Buddhas perform the Miracle.  In reply to Pasenadi, the Buddha said he would perform the miracle at the foot of the Gandamba tree on the full moon day of Asālha.  This was in the seventh year after the Enlightenment (DA.i.57).  [/p][p]The heretics therefore uprooted all mango trees for one league around, but, on the promised day, the Buddha went to the king's garden, accepted the mango offered by Ganda, and caused a marvelous tree to sprout from its seed.  The people, discovering what the heretics had done, attacked them, and they had to flee helter skelter.  It was during this flight that Pūrana Kassapa (q.v.) committed suicide.  The multitude, assembled to witness the miracle, extended to a distance of thirty six leagues.  The Buddha created a jewelled walk in the air by the side of the Gandamba.  When the Buddha's disciples knew what was in his mind, several of them offered to perform miracles and so refute the insinuations of the heretics.  Among such disciples were Gharanī, Culla Anātthapindika, Cīrā, Cunda, Uppalavannā and Moggallāna.  [/p][p]The Buddha refused their offers and related the Kanhausabha and Nandivisāla Jātakas.  Then, standing on the jewelled walk, he proceeded to perform the Yamaka-pātihāriya (Twin Miracle), so called because it consisted in the appearance of phenomena of opposite character in pairs - e.g., producing flames from the upper part of the body and a stream of water from the lower, and then alternatively.  Flames of fire and streams of water also proceeded alternatively from the right side of his body and from the left.  DA.l.57; DhA.iii.214f.  explains how this was done.  From every pore of his body rays of six colors darted forth, upwards to the realm of Brahmā and downwards to the edge of the Cakkavāla.  The Miracle lasted for a long while, and as the Buddha walked up and down the jewelled terrace he preached to the multitude from time to time.  It is said that he performed miracles and preached sermons during sixteen days, according to the various dispositions of those present in the assembly.  At the conclusion of the Miracle, the Buddha, following the example of his predecessors, made his way, in three strides, to Tāvatimsa, there to preach the Abhidhamma Pitaka to his mother, now born as a devaputta.[/p][p]The Twin Miracle is described at DA.i.57, and in very great detail at DhA.iii.204; see also J.iv.263ff.  The DhA.  version appears to be entirely different from the Jātaka version; the latter is very brief and lacks many details, especially regarding Pindola's miracle and the preaching of the Abhidhamma in Tāvatimsa.  The account given in Dvy.  (143-66) is again different; the Miracle was evidently repeatedly performed by the Buddha (see, e.g., Candanamālā), and it is often referred to - e.g., J.i.77, 88, 193; Ps.i.125; SNA.i.36; AA.i.71; MA.ii.962; Mil.  349; Vsm.390; PvA.137; Dāthāvamsa i.50.

  <entry>[div class="huge"]Yasa [/div][hr][p][b]1. Yasa Thera.  [/b] He was the son of a very wealthy treasurer of Benares, and was brought up in great luxury, living in three mansions, according to the seasons and surrounded with all kinds of pleasures.  Impelled by antecedent conditions, he saw one night the indecorum of his sleeping attendants, and, greatly distressed, put on his gold slippers and left the house and the town, non humans opening the gates for him.  He took the direction of Isipatana, exclaiming: "Alas! What distress! Alas! What danger!" The Buddha saw him in the distance and called to him, "Come Yasa, here is neither distress nor danger." Filled with joy, Yasa took off his slippers and sat beside the Buddha.  The Buddha preached to him a graduated discourse, and when he had finished teaching the Truths, Yasa attained realization of the Dhamma.  To Yasa's father, too, who had come in search of his son, the Buddha preached the Doctrine, having first made Yasa invisible to him.  (This is given as an example of the Buddha's iddhi power, Vsm.393).  At the end of the sermon he acknowledged himself the Buddha's follower, (he thus became the first tevācika upāsaka) and Yasa, who had been listening, became an arahant.  When, therefore, Yasa's presence became known to his father, who asked him to return to his grieving mother, the Buddha declared that household life had no attractions for Yasa and granted his request to be admitted to the Order.  The next day, at the invitation of Yasa's father, he went, accompanied by Yasa, to his house, and there, at the conclusion of the meal, he preached to Yasa's mother and other members of the household, who all became his followers, thus becoming the first tevācikā upāsikā.  When Yasa's intimate friends, Vimala, Subāhu, Punnaji and Gavampati, heard of Yasa's ordination they followed his example and joined the Order, attaining arahantship in due course, as did fifty others of Yasa's former friends and acquaintances (Vin.i.15 20; DhA.i.72).[/p][p]In the time of Sumedha Buddha, Yasa was a king of the Nāgas and invited the Buddha and his monks to his abode, where he showed them great honour and hospitality.  He then gave costly robes to the Buddha and to each monk a pair of valuable robes.  In the time of Siddhattha Buddha he was a Treasurer, and offered the seven kinds of jewels at the Bodhi tree.  In the time of Kassapa Buddha he was a monk.  For eighteen thousand kappas he was a deva king and one thousand times he was king of men.  Wherever he went he had a gold canopy, and in his last life over his funeral pyre was a gold canopy (ThagA.i.232f).  He is evidently identical with Sabbadāyaka of the Apadāna (Ap.i.333f).  A verse attributed to him is found in the Theragāthā (vs.117).[/p][p]Yasa is often quoted as one who enjoyed great luxury in his lay life (AA.ii.596).[/p][p]The Dhammapada Commentary (DhA.i.82f ) states that, in a past life, Yasa and his four companions wandered about engaged in various acts of social service.  One day they came across the dead body of a pregnant woman, which they took to the cemetery to be cremated.  There the others went away, leaving Yasa to finish the work.  While burning the corpse his mind was filled with thoughts of the foulness of the human body; he drew the attention of his friends to this idea, and, later, of his parents and wives, all of whom approved of what he said.  For this reason Yasa felt revulsion against the household life, and his friends and members of his family were able to realize the Dhamma early in the Buddha's career.[/p][p]The ordination of Yasa was one of the scenes of the Buddha's life to be sculptured in the Relic Chamber of the Mahā Thūpa (Mhv.xxx.79).[/p][p]According to the Anguttara Commentary (AA.i.218f), Sujātā Senānīdhītā (who gave the Buddha a meal of milk rice just before his Enlightenment) was Yasa's mother.

Yasa thereupon protested against such misdemeanours, and the Vajjian monks, hoping to win him over, offered him a share of the money they had collected.  [/p][p]This offer he rejected with scorn, and the monks passed on him the Patisārattiyakamma (craving of pardon from lay folk).  This necessitated that Yasa should be sent among the laymen, accompanied by a messenger, presumably to ask their pardon for having misinformed them.  But instead of this, Yasa told the lay people that the behaviour of the Vajjian monks was completely at variance with the rules laid down by the Buddha, and quoted the Buddha's discourses to prove his charge.  [/p][p]When the Vajjian monks heard of this, they pronounced on him the Ukkhepaniya Kamma (Act of Suspension), but when they assembled to carry it out, Yasa disappeared through the air to Kosambī, from where he sent messengers to the monks of Avanti, of the west (Pātheyyakā or Pāveyyakā) and of the south (Dakkhināpatha), asking for their assistance in checking the corruption of the religion.  With them he visited Sambhūta Sānavāsī at Ahogangapabbata, and there they decided to consult  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/r/revata,Revata')"]Revata[/a] who lived in Soreyya.  Yasa, therefore, went to Revata, following him through Sankassa, Kannakujja, Udumbara, Aggalapura and Sahajāti.  Having found Revata, he questioned him regarding the ten points, and obtained from him promise of assistance.  [/p][p]Together they returned to Vesāli, where lived Sabbakāmī, the oldest Thera of the day.  After obtaining his opinion on the matter, an assembly of the monks was held and a committee was appointed (to settle the matter by an Ubbāhikā) of four from the East: Sabbakāmī, Sālha, Khujjasobhita, and Vāsabhagāmika; and four from the West: Revata, Sambhūta-Sānavāsī, Yasa and Sumana.  They debated the question at the Vālikārāma, Revata acting as questioner and Sabbakāmī answering his questions.  At the end of the enquiry the decision was given against the ten points of the Vajjian monks, and this decision was conveyed to the assembly.  Then the recital of the Vinaya was held in which seven hundred monks participated; this recital was called the Sattasatī.  Vin.ii.294ff.; Mhv.iv.9ff.;; Dpv.iv.45ff.; v.23.

  <entry>[div class="huge"]Yonā, Yavanā, Yonakā[/div][p]A country and its people.  The name is probably the Pāli equivalent for Ionians, the Baktrian Greeks.  The Yonas are mentioned with the Kambojas in Rock Edicts v.  and xii of Asoka, as a subject people, forming a frontier district of his empire.  The country was converted by the Thera Mahārakkhita, who was sent there after the Third Council (Mhv.xii.5; Dpv.viii.9; Sp.i.67).  In the time of Milinda the capital of the Yona country was Sāgala (Mil.1).  It is said (Mhv.xxix.39) that at the Foundation Ceremony of the Mahā Thūpa, thirty thousand monks, under Yona Mahādhammarakkhita, came from Alasandā in the Yona country.  Alasandā was evidently the headquarters of the Buddhist monks at that time.  Alasandā is generally identified (See, e.g., Geiger, Mhv.  Trs.  194, n.3) with the Alexandria founded by the Macedonian king (Alexander) in the country of the Paropanisadae near Kābul.[/p][p]In the Assalāyana Sutta (M.ii.149), Yona and Kamboja are mentioned as places in which there were only two classes of people, masters and slaves, and the master could become a slave or vice versa.  The Commentary (MA.ii.784) explains this by saying that supposing a brahmin goes there and dies, his children might consort with slaves, in which case their children would be slaves.  In later times, the name Yavanā or Yonā seems to have included all westerners living in India and especially those of Arabian origin (Cv.Trs.ii.87, n.1).  Yonaka, statues, holding lamps, were among the decorations used by the Sākyans of Kapilavatthu (MA.ii.575).  The language of the Yavanas is classed with the Milakkhabhāsā (E.g., DA.i.276; VibhA.388).  [/p][p]The Anguttara Commentary (AA.i.51) records that from the time of Kassapa Buddha the Yonakas went about clad in white robes, because of the memory of the religion which was once prevalent there.[/p][hr]</entry>
  <entry>[div class="huge"]Yugandhara[/div][hr][p][b]1. Yugandhara.[/b] One of the mountains of the Himālaya (J.i.119, 232; iv.213; vi.125; DhA.i.249; Vsm.206).  It forms the first of the seven ranges round Sineru (SNA, ii.443; but according to J.vi.125 it is the fourth range).[/p][p]A Yugandharasāgara (e.g., J.i.64; vi.43) is also sometimes mentioned, and was probably a sea between Yugandhara and the next mountain range.  When the Buddha reached Tāvatimsa in three strides, his first stride was from the earth to Yugandhara (DhA.iii.216).  It was on the summit of Yugandhara that Assagutta convened an assembly of the monks in order to discuss their plan of campaign against Milinda (Mil.p.6).  The sun is mentioned as first rising over Yugandhara (E.g., SA.ii.165), hence the expression “Like the morning sun over Yugandhara.” E.g.  PvA.137.[/p][hr][p][b]2.

  <entry>[div class="huge"]Yakkha[/div][p]A class of non human beings generally described as amanussā.  They are mentioned with Devas, Rakkhasas, Dānavas, Gandhabbas, Kinnaras, and Mahoragas (? Nāgas) (E.g., J.v.420).  [/p][p]In other lists (E.g., PvA.  45, 55) they range immediately above the Petas; in fact, some of the happier Petas are called Yakkhas.  Elsewhere (E.g., A.ii.38) they rank, in progressive order, between manussā and gandhabbā.  They are of many different kinds: spirits, ogres, dryads, ghosts, spooks.  In the early records, yakkha, like nāgā, as an appellative, was anything but depreciative.  Thus not only is Sakka, king of the gods, so referred to (M.i.252; J.iv.4; DA.i.264), but even the Buddha is spoken of as a yakkha in poetic diction (M.i.386).  Many gods, such as Kakudha, are so addressed (S.i.54).  [/p][p]According to a passage in the Vimānavatthu Commentary, (VvA.333) which gives illustrations, the term is used for Sakka, the Four Regent Gods (Mahārājāno), the followers of Vessavana, and also for puriso (individual soul?).  In the scholiast to the Jayadissa Jātaka (J.v.33), the figure of the hare in the moon is also called yakkha.  Of these above named, the followers of Vessavana appear to be the Yakkhas proper.  The term yakkha as applied to purisa is evidently used in an exceptionally philosophical sense as meaning "soul" in such passages as ettāvatā yakkhassa suddhi (SN.vs.478), or ettāvat' aggam no vadanti h' ekā, yakkhassa suddhim idha pānditāse (SN.vs.875).  [/p][p]In the Niddesa (MNid.282), yakkha is explained by satta, nara, mānava, posa, puggala, jīva, jagu, jantu, indagu, manuja.  The last term is significant as showing that yakkha also means "man."[/p][p]The cult of yakkhas seems to have arisen primarily from the woods and secondarily from the legends of sea faring merchants.  To the latter origin belong the stories connected with vimānas found in or near the sea or in lakes.  The worship of trees and the spirits inhabitating them is one of the most primitive forms of religion.  Some, at least, of the yakkhas are called rukkha devatā (E.g., J.iii.309, 345; Pv.i.9; PvA.5) (spirits of trees), and others bhummadevatā, (PvA.45,55) (spirits of the earth), who, too, seem to have resided in trees.  Generally speaking, the Yakkhas were decadent divinities, beings half deified, having a deva's supernormal powers, particularly as regards influencing people, partly helpful, partly harmful.  They are sometimes called devatā (E.g., S.i.205), or devaputta (E.g., PvA.  113, 139).  Some of these, like Indakūta and Suciloma, are capable of intelligent questioning on metaphysics and ethics.  All of them possess supernatural powers; they can transfer themselves at will, to any place, with their abodes, and work miracles, such as assuming any shape at will.  An epithet frequently applied is mahiddhika (E.g., Pv.ii.9; J.vi.118).  Their appearance is striking as a result of former good kamma (Pv.i.2, 9; ii.11; iv.3, etc.).  They are also called kāmakāmī, enjoying all kinds of luxuries (Pv.i.3), but, because of former bad kamma, they are possessed of odd qualities, thus they are shy, they fear palmyra leaf and iron.  Their eyes are red and they neither wink nor cast a shadow.  J.iv.492; v.34; vi.336, 337; these various characteristics are, obviously, not found in all Yakkhas.  The Yakkhas are evidently of different grades - as is the case with all classes of beings - the highest among them approximate very nearly to the devas and have deva-powers, the lowest resemble petas.  The Yakkhas are specially mentioned as being afraid of palm leaves (J.iv.492).[/p][p]Their abode is their self created palace, which is anywhere, in the air, in trees, etc.  These are mostly ākasattha (suspended in the air), but some of them, like the abode of Ālavaka, are bhumattha (on the ground) and are described as being fortified (SNA.i.222).  Sometimes whole cities e.g., Ālakamandā stand under the protection of, or are inhabited by, Yakkhas.[/p][p]In many respects they resemble the Vedic Pisācas, though they are of different origin.  They are evidently remnants of an ancient demonology and have had incorporated in them old animistic beliefs as representing creatures of the wilds and the forests, some of them based on ethnological features.  (See Stede: Gespenstergeschichten des Petavatthu v.39ff ).[/p][p]In later literature the Yakkhas have been degraded to the state of red eyed cannibal ogres.  The female Yakkhas (Yakkhinī) are, in these cases, more fearful and evil minded than the male.  They eat flesh and blood (J.iv.549; v.34); and devour even men (D.ii.346; J.ii.15ff.) and corpses (J.i.265).  They eat babies (J.v.21; vi.336) and are full of spite and vengeance (DhA.i.47; ii.35f.).  The story of Bhūta Thera is interesting because his elder brothers and sisters were devoured by a hostile Yakkha, so the last child is called Bhūta to propitiate the Yakkha by making him the child's sponsor![/p][p]Ordinarily the attitude of the Yakkhas towards man is one of benevolence.  They are interested in the spiritual welfare of the human beings with whom they come in contact and somewhat resemble tutelary genii.  In the Atānātiya Sutta (D.iii.194f), however, the Yakkha king, Vessavana, is represented as telling the Buddha that, for the most part, the Yakkhas believe neither in the Buddha nor in his teachings, which enjoin upon his followers abstention from various evils and are therefore distasteful to some of the Yakkhas.  Such Yakkhas are disposed to molest the followers of the Buddha in their woodland haunts.  Cp.  the story of the Yakkha who wished to kill Sāriputta (Ud.iv.4).  But the Mahā Yakkhas (a list in D.iii.204f), the generals and commanders among Yakkhas, are always willing to help holy men and to prevent wicked Yakkhas from hurting them.  Among Yakkhas are some beings who are sotāpannas - e.g., Janavasabha, Suciloma and Khara (s.v.).  Some Yakkhas even act as messengers from another world, and will save prospective sinners from committing evil (Pv.iv.1).  The case of the Yakkha Vajirapāni is of special interest.  D.i.95. The Commentary (DA.i.264) says he is not an ordinary Yakkha, but Sakka himself.[/p][p]He is represented as a kind of mentor, hovering in the air, threatening to kill Ambattha, if he does not answer the Buddha's question the third time he is asked.  In many cases the Yakkhas are "fallen angels" and come eagerly to listen to the word of the Buddha in order to be able to rise to a higher sphere of existence e.g., Piyankaramātā and Punabbasumātā, and even Vessavana, listening to Velukandakī Nandamātā reciting the Parāyana Vagga (A.iv.63).  At the preaching of the Mahāsamaya Sutta (q.v.) many hundreds of thousands of Yakkhas were present among the audience.[/p][p]It has been pointed out (Stede, op.  cit) that the names of the Yakkhas often give us a clue to their origin and function.  These are taken from (a) their bodily appearance e.g., Kuvannā, Khara, Kharaloma, Kharadāthika, Citta, Cittarāja, Silesaloma, Sūciloma and Hāritā; (b) their place of residence, attributes of their realms, animals, plants, etc.  e.g., Ajakalāpaka, Ālavaka (forest dweller), Uppala, Kakudha (name of plant), Kumbhīra, Gumbiya, Disāmukha, Yamamoli, Vajira, Vajirapāni or Vajirabāhu, Sātāgira, Serīsaka; (c) qualities of character, etc.  e.g., Adhamma, Katattha, Dhamma, Punnaka, Māra, Sakata; (d) embodiments of former persons e.g., Janavasabha (lord of men= Bimbisāra), Dīgha, Naradeva, Pandaka, Sīvaka, Serī.[/p][p]Vessavana (q.v.) is often mentioned as king of the Yakkhas.  He is one of the four Regent Gods, and the Ātānātiya Sutta (D.iii.199ff) contains a vivid description of the Yakkha kingdom of Uttarakuru, with its numerous cities, crowds of inhabitants, parks, lakes and assembly halls.  Vessavana is also called Kuvera, and the Yakkhas are his servants and messengers.  They wait upon him in turn.  The Yakkhinīs draw water for him, and often are so hard worked that many die in his service.  E.g., J.iv.492. Mention is also made (e.g., DA.ii.370) of Yakkhadāsīs who have to dance and sing to the devas during the night.  Early in the morning they drink a cup of toddy (surā) and go off into a deep sleep, from which they rise betimes in the evening ready for their duties.[/p][p]No one, apparently, is free from this necessity of waiting upon the king even Janavasabba has to run errands for Vessavana (D.ii.207).  Among the duties of Vessavana is the settling of disputes between the devas, and this keeps him (J.vi.270) much occupied.  In this work he is helped by the Yakkhasenāpati, whose business it is to preside over the courts during eight days of each mouth (SNA.i.197).  The Yakkhas hold regular assemblies on Manosilātala on the Bhagalavatīpabbata (SNA.i.187; cp.  D.iii.201 and DA.iii.967).  As followers of Kuvera, lord of riches, the Yakkhas are the guardians and the liberal spenders of underground riches, hidden treasures, etc., with which they delight men.  E.g., Pv.ii.11; PvA.145; Pv.iv.12; PvA.274. These were seven yakkhas who guarded the wealth of Jotiyasetthi (DhA.iv.208f.).[/p][p]It is difficult to decide whether the Yakkhas, who are the aborigines of Ceylon (Lankā), were considered human or non human.  Kuvenī, one of their princesses, and her maid, can both assume different forms, but Vijaya marries Kuveni and has two children by her.  (Cp.  Vin.iii.37; iv.  20; where sexual intercourse with a Yakkha is forbidden).  The Yakkhas are invisible, and Vijaya is able to kill them only with the help of Kuveni (Mhv.vii.36); but their clothes are found fit for Vijaya and his followers to wear (Mhv.vii.38).  Again, Cetiyā (q.v.) could make herself invisible and assume the form of a mare, but Pandukābhaya lived with her for four years and she gave him counsel in battle.  Later, when he held festivities, he had the Yakkha Cittarāja on the throne beside him (Mhv.x.87).  In all probability these Yakkhas were originally considered as humans, but later came to be confused with non humans.  Their chief cities were Lankāpura and Sirīsavatthu.[/p][p]The commonly accepted etymology of Yakkha is from the root yaj, meaning to sacrifice.  Thus: yajanti tattha balim upaharantī ti yakkha (VvA.224), or pūjanīyabhāvato yakkho, ti uccati (VvA.333).[/p][hr]</entry>

They reached Ceylon on the day of the Buddha's death, received the protection of the deva Uppalavanda, and thus escaped destruction by the Yakkhas.  The Yakkhinī, Kuvenī, fell in love with Vijaya, and he, with her assistance, killed the Yakkhas of Lankāpura and Sirīsavatthu, and founded the city of Tambapanni.  Vijaya's chief ministers, Anurādha, Upatissa, Ujjena, Uruvela and Vijita, founded separate colonies, named after themselves.[/p][p]Vijaya had two children by Kuvenī, Jīvahattha and Dīpellā; but when he wished to be consecrated king, he sent for and obtained, for his wife, a daughter of the Pandu king of Madhurā.

She founded, for the Order headed by Sāriputta and Moggallāna an offering which the Buddha praised, because it was endowed with the six requisite qualities.  See Dāna Sutta (1).[/p][p]Once she rose before dawn and sang the Parāyana.  Vessavana happened to be passing over her house on his way from north to south (to see the Buddha, says SNA.i.369), and hearing the song, stopped at her window to praise it and to reveal his identity.  She greeted him cordially, and in return for her greeting he announced to her that Sāriputta and Moggallāna were on their way to Velukanta.  She, delighted with the news, made all preparations and sent word to the monastery, inviting the monks to the house.  After the meal, she informed the Elders that Vessavana had told her of their arrival.  When they expressed their amazement, she told them of several other virtues possessed by her.  Her only son Nanda was seized by the king's men and killed before her eyes, but she experienced no disquiet, nor did she when her husband, after his death, having been born as a Yakkha (Bhummadevatā says the Commentary), revealed himself to her.  She was guilty of no transgression of the precepts, could enter into the four jhānas at will, and had cast off the five lower fetters.  The monks expressed their great admiration and Sāriputta preached to her (A.iv.63ff).[/p][p]Buddhaghosa says (AA.ii.718; cf.  SNA.i.370) that she was an anāgāmī, and that, when she promised to share with Vessavana the merits she would gain by entertaining the monks, headed by the two Chief Disciples, Vessavana, to show his gratitude, filled her stores with rice, and these stores remained always full throughout her life.  They thus became proverbial.[/p][p]The Sutta Nipāta Commentary (SNA.i.370) states that she kept a daily fast and knew the Pitakas by heart.  It also says that, at the end of her recital of the Parāyana, Vessavana offered her a boon, and she asked that, as her servants were weary of carrying the harvest home from the fields, Vessavana should allow his Yakkhas to do the work for them.  To this he agreed, and his followers filled for her one thousand two hundred and fifty store houses.  Vessavana then went to the Buddha and told him of what had happened.[/p][p]The Dhammapada Commentary (DhA.i.340) mentions Velukantakī Nandamātā and Khujjattarā as the chief lay women disciples of the Buddha.  But in the Anguttara list' of eminent lay women, while Velukantakī Nandamātā's name does not occur, Khujjatarā is mentioned.  Mention is made of a Nandamātā, eminent in meditation, but she is called Uttarā.[/p][p]A.i.26; cf.  S.ii.236, where the same two are mentioned; Mrs.  Rhys Davids thinks that Velukantakī Nandamātā is probably identical with Uttarā Nandamātā (Brethren 4, n.1).

  <entry>[div class="huge"]Vijayabāhu[/div][hr][p][b]1. Vijayabāhu.  [/b] King of Ceylon (Vijayabāhu I., 1059-1114 A.C.).  His earlier name was Kitti; his parents were Moggallāna and Lokitā (Cv.lvii.42f.; but see Cv.Trs.i.201, n.1), and from his thirtieth year he lived in Mūlasālā.  Later, without the knowledge of his parents, he left home, defeated the general Loka, and became Adipāda of Malaya after bringing this province under his power.  At the age of sixteen he defeated Kassapa, chief of the Kesadhātus, and became ruler of Rohana as well, assuming the title of Yuvarāja and the name of Vijayabāhu.  At this time the Colas were in possession of the government at Pulatthipura, and they made efforts to stem the advance of Vijayabāhu.  They were at first successful, owing to the disunion among the Singhalese themselves, but Vijayabāhu conquered the Cola armies near Palutthapabbata and marched to Pulatthipura.  He was helped by forces sent by the king of Rāmañña, to whom he sent an embassy with various presents.  He had, however, to bide his time, and retreated to Vātagiri.  From there he went, in due course, to Mahānāgahula, his officers having, in the meantime, crushed all opposition in Dakkhinadesa and captured the province of Anurādhapura and the district round Mahātittha.  When he felt the right moment had arrived, Vijayabāhu marched once more to Pulatthipura and captured it after a siege of one and a half months.  From there he advanced to Anurādhapura, spent three months in the city and returned to Pulatthipura.  This was fifteen years after he became Yuvarāja.  In the eighteenth year he crowned himself king, under the title of Sirisanghabodhi, making his younger brother Vīrabāhu Yuvarāja and governor of Dakkhinadesa, and his other brother, Jayabāhu, Adipāda and governor of Rohana.  The king had several queens, among whom was Līlāvatī, a Cola princess and daughter of Jagatīpāla; by her he had a daughter Yasodharā.  Another of his queens was a Kālinga princess, Tilokasundarī, by whom he had five daughters Subhaddā, Sumittā, Lokanāthā, Ratanāvalī and Rūpavatī and a son called Vikkamabāhu.  Vijayabāhu gave his younger sister, Mittā, in marriage to the king of Pandu, refusing an offer of marriage made by the Cola king.[/p][p]When peace had been established, Vijayabāhu sent messengers to Anuruddha, king of Rāmañña, and fetched monks from that country to help in the reformation of the Sangha in Ceylon.  He gave over the whole district of Alisāra for the use of the monks and built many vihāras.  He translated the Dhammasangani and held an annual Dandissara offering.  He also had the Tipitaka copied, and presented the copies to various monks.  Because the Singhalese envoys sent to Kannāta were insulted and maimed, the king prepared to send a punitive expedition to Cola, but the Velakkāra troops revolted, captured Mittā and her children, and burned the king's palace.  The king was forced to retreat to Dakkhinadesa but, with the help of Vīrabāhu, he defeated the rebels.  In the forty fifth year of his reign he took an army to Cola and stopped at a seaport in that country; but as the Cola king refused to accept his challenge to fight, he returned to his own country.  He repaired many tanks and restored many vihāras in various parts of the country.  He provided facilities for pilgrims journeying to Samantakūta, and patronized the Lābhavāsī and the Vantajīvaka monks.  He ruled for fifty five years.  Vīrabāhu died before him, and he made Jayabāhu Uparāja in his place.  For details of Vijayabāhu's reign, see Cv.  chaps.  lviii lx.[/p][hr][p][b]2.

He was a good king, but was slain at the end of one year's reign by Mahinda (afterwards Mahinda VI.).  His viceroy was Kittinissanka.  Cv.lxxx.1-18.[/p][hr][p][b]3. Vijayabāhu.[/b] King of Ceylon (Vijayabāhu III., 1232-36 A.C.).  He claimed descent from King Sirisanghabodhi I.  and was lord of the Vannī.  He found the government of Ceylon in the hands of the Damilas, and, after defeating them, he established the seat of government in Jambuddoni.  He sent for the monks, who, with Vācissara at their head, had left Ceylon during the preceding disturbed period and had deposited the Buddha's Alms bowl and Tooth Relic in the rock fortress at Billasela.  The king did much for the reform of the priesthood and built various monasteries, chief of which was the Vijayasundarārāma and the Vijayabāhu vihāra.  He had two sons, Parakkamabāhu and Bhuvanekabāhu.  He appointed the Elder Sangharakkhita as head of the Order in Ceylon.  Cv.lxxxi.10ff.[/p][hr][p][b]4. Vijayabāhu.[/b] King of Ceylon (Vijayabāhu IV., 1271-72 A.C.).  He was the eldest of the five sons of Parakkamabāhu II., his brothers being Bhuvanekabāhu, Tibhuvanamalla, Parakkamabāhu and Jayabāhu.  With the consent of the monks, Parakkamabāhu II.  handed over the government, before his death, to Vijayabāhu, who was evidently very popular, and was known among his subjects as a Bodhisatta.  (See, e.g., Cv.lxxxviii.35).  He restored Pulatthipura and built and renovated numerous monasteries, among them the vihāra at Titthagāma.  During his reign, Candabhānu invaded Ceylon, but was defeated by the king with the help of his Adipāda, Vīrabāhu.  Vijayabāhu built a city near Subhagiri and made it his seat of government.  He restored the Ratnāvalī cetiya and gave Anurādhapura into the charge of the Vanni chiefs.  Later, when Vīrabāhu had completely restored Pulatthipura, the king was consecrated there in the presence of his father, who came over from Jambuddoni.  Then, at the desire of his father, he held, on the Mahāvālukagangā, at Sahassatittha, a festival for admission into the Order.  The celebrations lasted a fortnight, and the king conferred on the monks various ranks, such as mahāsāmipāda, mūlatherapāda, parivenathera, etc.  Two years after the death of Parakkamabāhu, Vijayabāhu was slain by a treacherous general, named Mitta.

This the snake refused to do even though threatened with death by the doctor.[/p][p]The story was told in reference to a vow taken by Sāriputta.  Some villagers once brought some meal cakes to the monastery, and when the monks present there had eaten, it was suggested that what remained should be saved for those monks who were absent in the village.  This was done, but a young colleague of Sāriputta, arriving very late, found that Sāriputta had already eaten his portion, whereat he was very disappointed.

Vipassī held the uposatha only once in seven years (DhA.iii.236), but on such occasions the whole Sangha was present (Sp.i.186).  The construction of a Gandhakuti for Vipassī brought Mendaka great glory in the present age.  Mendaka's name at the time was Avaroja (DhA.iii.364f).  Aññākondañña was then known as Cūlakāla, and nine times he gave Vipassī Buddha the first fruits of his fields.  DhA.i.81f.[/p][hr]</entry>
  <entry>[div class="huge"]Visayha Jātaka (No.  340)[/div][p]The Bodhisatta was once born as Visayha, setthi of Benares, and gave alms daily to six hundred thousand persons in six different parts of the city.  Sakka's throne was heated by his great generosity, and, feeling nervous for his safety, Sakka contrived that all Visayha's possessions should disappear.  Quite undaunted, Visayha became a grass cutter, and for six days gave alms from the money so earned, he and his wife fasting.  On the seventh day, while cutting grass, he fainted, and Sakka, appearing before him, suggested that he, should be moderate in his generosity.  Visayha rejected the suggestion as unworthy and declared that his aim was Buddhahood.  Thereupon Sakka praised him and made him prosperous.[/p][p]The story was related to Anāthapindika, as mentioned in the Khadirangāra Jātaka.  Visayha's wife is identified with Rāhulamātā.

  <entry>[div class="huge"]Vepacitti[/div][p]An Asura chieftain, who was present with Namuci (Māra) at the preaching of the Mahāsamaya Sutta (D.ii.259).  It is said that among the Asuras, Vepacitti, Rāhu and Pahārada were the chiefs.  E.g., AA.ii.758, Vepacitti being the highest (sabbajetthaka, SA.i.263).[/p][p]Vepacitti was the friend of Rāhu, and when Rāhu seized Candimā and Suriya and these invoked the power of the Buddha, it was to Vepacitti that Rāhu fled for comfort (S.i.50, 51).  The Asuras being once defeated in a fight with the Devas, the latter took Vepacitti prisoner, and brought him, bound hand and foot, to Sakka in the Sudhammā hall.  There Vepacitti reviled and railed at Sakka with scurrilous words, both on entering and on leaving the hall, but Sakka remained silent, and, when questioned by Mātalī, said it was not proper for him to bandy words with a fool.  S.i.221f.; cf.  S.iv.201, according to which his bondage caused him no inconvenience so long as he remained with the devas, but the moment he experienced the wish to rejoin the Asuras, he felt himself bound.  Vepacitti's capture is referred to in Thag.vs.749.[/p][p]On another occasion Vepacitti suggested that victory should be given to him or to Sakka, according to their excellence in speech.  Sakka agreed to this, and Vepacitti, as the older god, was asked to speak a verse.  Sakka spoke another, the Devas applauding.  Several verses were spoken by each, and both Devas and Asuras decided in favour of Sakka, because Vepacitti's verses belonged, they said, to the sphere of violence, while those of Sakka belonged to one of concord and harmony (S.i.222f).  Once, when Sakka was revolving in his mind the thought that he should not betray even his enemy, Vepacitti read his thoughts and came up to him.  "Stop," said Sakka, "thou art my prisoner"; but Vepacitti reminded him of his thought, and was allowed to go free (S.i.225).[/p][p]Buddhaghosa says (SA.i.266) that Vepacitti's original name was Sambara (q.v.).  When Sambara refused to give to the seers, who visited him, a pledge that the Asuras would not harm them, the seers cursed him, and from that time onwards he slept badly and was plagued by nightmares.  This so deranged his mind (cittam vepati) that he came to be called Vepacitti ("Crazy nerve").  When Vepacitti lay ill of this disease, Sakka visited him and offered to cure him if he would teach him Sambara's magic art.  Vepacitti consulted the Asuras, and, as they were unwilling, he refused Sakka's offer, warning him that Sambara, having practised magic, was suffering in purgatory and that he should avoid a similar fate (S.i.238f).[/p][p]Buddhaghosa explains that, if Vepacitti had taught him the art, it was Sakka's intention to take Vepacitti to the seers and persuade them to forgive him (SA.i.272).  This episode seems to contradict Buddhaghosa's previous statement that Sambara and Vepacitti were identical.  Perhaps, as Mrs.  Rhys Davids suggests (KS.i.305, n.4), Sambara was the name of an office rather than that of a person.[/p][p]Mention is made (S.i.226) of a visit once paid by Sakka and Vepacitti to a company of seers dwelling in a forest hut.  Vepacitti, in his buskins, his sword hanging at his side and his state canopy borne over his head, entered by the main gate, while Sakka, in all humility, used the side gate.  Buddhaghosa explains (SA.i.265) the strange relations of Sakka and Vepacitti by saying that they were father and son in law, and that they were sometimes at war with each other; sometimes, however, they lived in concord.  The Dhammapada Commentary (DhA.i.278 L; cf.  J.i.205f ) gives the story of the romantic marriage of Sakka to Vepacitti's daughter, Sujā (q.v.).[/p][p]According to the Kathā vatthu, other members of Vepacitti's family appear to have intermarried with the devas, and the Kathā vatthu Commentary says that a troop of Asuras, belonging to the retinue of Vepacitti, was once freed from the fourfold plane of misery and was taken up among the devas.  See Points of Controversy, p.  211.[/p][p]The Sanskrit texts call him Vemacitra or Vemacitrī.  E.g., Dvy., pp.  126, 148; Mtu.iii.138,254.[/p][hr]</entry>

When the child was born, two friends of Vasabha, Vela and Sumana, came with gifts, and the boy was given their two names.  When Velusumana grew up, he went to live with Sumana, governor of Girijanapada, and broke in a horse with which everyone else had failed.  Sumana therefore gave him one hundred thousand and sent him to Kākavannatissa's court (Mhv.xxiii.68ff).[/p][p]When Vihāradevī wished to drink water in which had been washed the sword which cut off the head of Nandasārathi, Elāra's chief warrior, Velusumana was entrusted with the task of killing Nandasārathi.  He therefore went to Anurādhapura, where he became friendly with the keeper of the king's state horse, Vāha.  One day he took the horse to bathe in the Kadambanadī, and, after announcing his name, rode away on him.  Elarā sent Nandasārathi in pursuit.  Velusumana stood concealed behind a thicket, on a mound called Nigrodhasāla, with drawn sword, and as Nandasārathi rode past quickly, he was transfixed by Velusumana's sword (Mhv.xxii.51ff.; MT.  440f).[/p][p]Velusumana took a prominent part in the capture of Vijitapura (Mhv.xxv.25).

[/b] Son of Vijayabāhu I.  and Tilokasundarī.  He had two wives, Sundarī and Līlāvatī (Cv.lix.32, 49f).  He was made Adipāda by Vijayabāhu I., and, when his son Gajabāhu was born, the king gave the province of Rohana for his welfare.  Vikkamabāhu lived there with Mahānāgahula (Cv.lx.88f) as his capital.  When Vijayabāhu died, some of Vikkamabāhu's relations, Jayabāhu and the three sons of Mittā (Mānābharana, Kittisirimegha and Sirivallabha) conspired to keep him out of the succession, but he defeated them in various battles and took possession of the capital Pulatthipura, losing, however, Dakkhinadesa and his former province of Rohana (Cv.lxi.2f).  A year later his enemies again rose in revolt, led by Mānābharana, and, as Vikkamabāhu advanced to Kalyanī to fight them, Vīradeva, of Palandīpa (q.v.) landed in Mannāra, and his attention was diverted.  In the first engagements, Vikkamabāhu was defeated by Vīradeva and forced to flee to Kotthasāra, but Vīradeva was later defeated and slain at Antaravitthika.  From then onwards Vikkamabāhu and the three sons of Mittā (see above) lived each in his province, but became unpopular both with the sangha and the laity owing to their greed and lust.  Following the death of Jayabāhu and the Queen Mittā, Vikkamabāhu appears to have been acknowledged king (Vikkamabāhu II.); and it was evidently as such that the birth of his nephew, the prince who after became Parakkamabāhu.  I., was reported to him.  Vikkamabāhu had two sons, Mahinda, and Gajabāhu, but asked that his nephew should be sent to the court; this request, however, was not granted (Cv.lxii.58f).

They cannot decide among themselves and agree, therefore, to refer the matter to Dhanañjaya's minister, Vidhurapandita (the Bodhisatta).  The minister listens to the claims of each and then declares that all are equal; their virtues are like the spokes of a wheel.  They are pleased, and Sakka gives the minister a silk robe, Varuna a jewel, the Supanna king a golden garland, and Dhanañjaya one thousand cows.[/p][p]Vimalā, Varuna's wife, hearing from her husband of Vidhura's wisdom, is so enchanted that she yearns to see him, and in order to do so feigns illness, and says that she must have Vidhura's heart.  Varuna's daughter, Irandatī, is offered to anyone who can get possession of Vidhura's heart, and the Yakkha Punnaka, nephew of Vessavana, who sees her and is fascinated by her beauty, accepts the condition.  He obtains Vessavana's consent by a ruse and visits Dhanañjaya's court.  There he challenges the king to a game of dice, giving his name as Kaccāyana, and offers as stake his wonderful steed and all seeing gem, provided the king will offer Vidhura as his.  Dhanañaya agrees, plays and loses.  Vidhura agrees to go with Punnaka; the king asks him questions regarding the householder's life for his own guidance, and Vidhura is given three days' leave to visit his family.  Having taken leave of them, he goes with Punnaka.  On the way Punnaka tries in vain to kill him by frightening him.  When Vidhura discovers Punnaka's intention, he preaches to him as he sits on the top of the Kālapabbata, and the Yakkha is so moved that he offers to take Vidhura back to Indapatta.  But in spite of his protestations, Vidhura insists on going on to the Nāga world.  They arrive in Varuna's abode; Vidhura preaches first to Varuna and then to Vimalā.  They are both delighted, and Punnaka wins the hand of Irandatī.  In his great joy Punnaka gives Vidhura his marvellous jewel and takes him back to Indapatta.  There Vidhura relates his adventures and gives the jewel to the king.  A festival lasting one month is held in honour of Vidhura's return.[/p][p]The story was related in reference to the Buddha's wisdom.

In the Ātānātiya Sutta he is the spokesman, and he recited the Ātānātiya-rune for the protection of the Buddha and his followers from the Yakkhas who had no faith in the Buddha.  D.iii.194; he was spokesman because "he was intimate with the Buddha, expert in conversation, well trained" (DA.iii.962).[/p][p]He rides in the Nārīvāhana, which is twelve yojanas long, its seat being of coral.  His retinue is composed of ten thousand crores of Yakkhas.  (SNA.i.379; the preacher's seat in the Lohapāsāda at Anurādhapura was made in the design of the Nārīvāhana, Mhv.xxvii.29).  He is a sotāpanna and his life span is ninety thousand years (AA.ii.718).  The books record a conversation between him and Velukantakī Nandamāta (q.v.), when he heard her sing the Parāyana Vagga and stayed to listen.  When Cūlasubhaddā wished to invite the Buddha and his monks to her house in Sāketa, and felt doubtful about it, Vessavana appeared before her and said that the Buddha would come at her invitation (AA.ii.483).[/p][p]On another occasion (A.iv.162; on his way to see the Buddha) he heard Uttara Thera preaching to the monks in Dhavajālikā on the Sankheyya Mountain, near Mahisavatthu, and went and told Sakka, who visited Uttara and had a discussion with him.[/p][p]Once when Vessavana was travelling through the air, he saw Sambhūta Thera wrapt in samādhi.  Vessavana descended from his chariot, worshipped the Thera, and left behind two Yakkhas with orders to wait until the Elder should emerge from his trance.  The Yakkhas then greeted the Thera in the name of Vessavana and told him they had been left to protect him.  The Elder sent thanks to Vessavana, but informed him, through the Yakkhas, that the Buddha had taught his disciples to protect themselves through mindfulness, and so further protection was not needed.  Vessavana visited Sambhūta on his return, and finding that the Elder had become an arahant, went to Sāvatthi and carried the news to the Buddha.  ThagA.i.46f.  Just as he encouraged the good, so he showed his resentment against the wicked; see, e.g., Revatī.[/p][p]Mention is made of Vessavana's Gadāvudha* and his mango tree, the Atulamba**.  Alavaka's abode was near that of Vessavana (SNA.i.240).[/p][blockquote][p]* SNA.i.225; the books (e,g., SA.i.249; Sp.ii.440) are careful to mention that he used his Gadāvudha only while he was yet a puthujjana.[/p][p]** J.iv.324, also called Abbhantaramba (see the Abbharantara Jātaka).[/p][/blockquote][p]Bimbisāra, after death, was born seven times as one of the ministers (paricaraka) of Vessavana, and, while on his way with a message from Vessavana to Virūlhaka, visited the Buddha and gave him an account of a meeting of the devas which Vessavana had attended and during which Sanankumāra had spoken in praise of the Buddha and his teachings (D.ii.206f).  Vessavana seems to have been worshipped by those desiring children.  See, e.g., the story of Rājadatta (ThagA.i.403).  There was in Anurādhapura a banyan tree dedicated as a shrine to Vessavana in the time of Pandukābhaya (Mhv.x.89).  Vessavana is mentioned as having been alive in the time of Vipassī Buddha.  When Vipassī died, there was a great earthquake which terrified the people, but Vessavana appeared and quieted their fears (ThagA.i.149).  Vessavana accompanied Sakka when he showed Moggallāna round Vejayanta pāsāda.  M.i.253; because he was Sakka's very intimate friend (MA.i.476).[/p][p]As lord of the Yakkhas, it was in the power of Vessavana to grant to any of them special privileges, such as the right of devouring anyone entering a particular pond, etc.  See, e.g., DhA.iii.74; J.i.128; iii.325 (Makhādeva).  Sometimes, e.g., in the case of Avaruddhaka (DhA.ii.237), a Yakkha had to serve Vessavana for twelve years in order to obtain a particular boon (cf.  J.ii.16,17).  (Three years at J.iii.502.) Vessavana some times employs the services of uncivilized human beings (paccantamilakkhavāsika) DA.iii.865f.  The Yakkhas fear him greatly.  If he is angry and looks but once, one thousand Yakkhas are broken up and scattered "like parched peas hopping about on a hot plate" (J.ii.399).  This was probably before he became a sotāpanna.[/p][p]Vessavana, like Sakka, was not the name of a particular being, but of the holder of an office.  When one Vessavana died, Sakka chose another as his successor.  The new king, on his accession, sent word to all the Yakkhas, asking them to choose their special abodes (J.i.328).  It was the duty of Yakkhinīs to fetch water from Anotatta for Vessavana's use.  Each Yakkhinī served her turn, sometimes for four, sometimes for five months.

There, in due course, he became a famous teacher, with eighty four thousand princes among his pupils.  Later, he became chaplain to the Benares king.  Every year the eighty four thousand princes came to Benares to pay their respects to the king, causing great suffering to the people.  These complained to the king, and he asked Velāma to find a way out of the difficulty.  Velāma marked out eighty four thousand provinces for the princes, and, thereafter, they obtained their supplies from their respective dominions.[/p][p]Velāma was exceedingly wealthy and wished to give alms.  Therefore, turning his water jar upside down, he wished that if there were holy men in the world, the water should flow downwards.  The water, however, remained in the jar.  He then discovered by the same means that his gifts would be free from blame.  He thereupon held great almsgivings, distributing during seven years the seven precious things and gifts of great value, pouring forth his riches as though "making into one stream the five great rivers." A list of his gifts is found at A.iv.393f.

  <entry>[div class="huge"]Vedabbha Jātaka (No.  48)[/div][p]There was once a brahmin who knew the Vedabbha charm which, if repeated at a certain conjunction of the planets, made the seven precious things rain down from the sky.  The Bodhisatta was his pupil, and one day, while journeying in the forest, they were attacked by five hundred robbers called "despatchers" (pesankacorā).  They were so called because when they took two prisoners they would keep one, sending the other for ransom.[/p][p]These robbers kept the brahmin and sent the Bodhisatta for the ransom.  The Bodhisatta, knowing that that night the conjunction of the stars would occur, which ensured the efficacy of the charm, warned the brahmin not to make use of it.  But when night came the brahmin repeated the charm, and the robbers were so delighted that he was able to persuade them to set him free.  They set off with the treasures that had fallen from the sky, the brahmin accompanying them, but on the way they were attacked by another robber band.  These were told that the brahmin could make treasures fall from the sky; they were therefore set free, only the brahmin being kept back.  But on being told that they must wait for one year for the necessary conjunction of planets, they were angry, cut the brahmin in two, and pursued the first band of robbers, destroying them entirely.  Unable to agree on the division of the spoils which they thus obtained, the second band fought among themselves till only two were left.  These took the treasure and hid it in a jungle near the village.  One guarded it while the other went to the village for rice.  When he returned he cooked the rice, ate his share, and put poison in the rest hoping thus to rid himself of his companion; the latter, however, killed him, then ate the rice and died himself.  The Bodhisatta returning with the ransom, found all the dead bodies, in various places, and realized what had happened.

When the Buddha first visited Rājagaha, after his Enlightenment, he stayed at the Latthivanuyyāna (Vin.i.35).  The day after his arrival, he accepted the king's invitation to a meal at the palace, at the end of which the king, seeking a place for the Buddha to live "not too far from the town, not too near, suitable for coming and going, easily accessible to all people, by day not too crowded, by night not exposed to noise and clamour, clean of the smell of people, hidden from men and well fitted to seclusion" decided on Veluvana, and bestowed it on the Buddha and the fraternity.  This was the first ārāma accepted by the Buddha, and a rule was passed allowing monks to accept such an ārāma.  Vin.i.39f.; according to BuA.  (19; cf.  ApA.i.75) the earth trembled when the water - poured over the Buddha's hand by Bimbisāra in dedication of Veluvana - fell on the earth.  This was the only ārāma in Jambudīpa, the dedication of which was accompanied by a tremor of the earth.  It was the dedication of Veluvana which was quoted as precedent by Mahinda, when he decided to accept the Mahāmeghavana, at Anurādhapura, from Devānampiyatissa (Mhv.xv.17).[/p][p]The Buddha at once went to stay there, and it was during this stay that Sāriputta and Moggallāna joined the Order.  Vin.i.42.[/p][p]Kalandakanivāpa (q.v.) is the place nearly always mentioned as the spot where the Buddha stayed in Veluvana.  There many Vinaya rules were passed - e.g., on the keeping of the vassa (Vin.i.137), the use of food cooked in the monastery (Vin.i.210f), the picking of edible (kappiya) fruit in the absence of any layman from whom permission to do so could be obtained (Vin.i.212), surgical operations on monks (Vin.i.215f), the eating of sugar (Vin.i.226), the rubbing of various parts of the body against wood (Vin.ii.105), the use of the kinds of dwelling (Vin.ii.146) and the use of gold and silver (Vin.ii.196).[/p][p]During the Buddha's stay at Veluvana, Dabba Mallaputta, at his own request, was appointed regulator of lodgings and apportioner of rations, (Vin.ii.74. The Buddha was at Veluvana when Dabba also decided to die.  He went there to take leave of the Buddha, Ud.viii.9) and Sāriputta and Moggallāna brought back the five hundred monks whom Devadatta had enticed away to Gayāsīsa (Vin.ii.200).  The Buddha spent the second, third, and fourth vassas at Veluvana.  BuA.3; it was while the Buddha was at Veluvana that Devadatta attempted to kill him by causing Nālāgiri to be let loose against him (J.v.335).  It was a very peaceful place, and monks, who had taken part in the first Convocation, rested there, in Kalandakanivāpa, after their exertions.  It was there that they met Purāna, who refused to acknowledge the authenticity of their Recital (Vin.ii.289f).[/p][p]Numerous Jātakas were recited at Veluvana - e.g., Asampadāna, Upahāna, Ubhatobhattha, Kandagalaka, Kālabāhu, Kukkuta, Kumbhila, Kurunga, Kurungamiga, Giridanta, Guttila, Culladhammapāla, Cūlahamsa, Cūlanandiya, Jambu, Tayodhamma, Thusa, Dummedha, Dūbhiyamakkata, Dhammaddhaja, Nigrodha, Parantapa, Pucimanda, Mangala, Manicora, Manoja, Mahākapi, Mahāhamsa, Mūsika, Romaka, Rohantamiga, Ruru, Lakkhana, Latukika, Vānara, Vānarinda, Vinīlaka, Virocana, Saccankura, Sañjīva, Sabbadātha, Sarabhanga, Sāliya, Sigāla, Sīlavanāga, Suvannakakkata, Hamsa and Hāritamātā.

Among those who visited the Buddha at Veluvana were several devaputtas: Dīghalattha, Nandana, Candana, Sudatta, Subrahmā, Asama, Sahali, Ninka, Akotaka, Vetambari and Mānavagāmiya; also the Dhanañjanī brahmin; the Bhāradvājas: Akkosaka, Asurinda, Bilangika, Aggika, Acela Kassapa, Susīma; the thirty monks from Pāvā (S.ii.187); Theras, like Mahākappina Aññākondañña (just before his death); Sonagahapatiputta, Samiddhi, Moliya Sīvaka, Tālaputa, Manicūlaka, Mahācunda (during his illness), (S.v.181) Visākha (after his visit to Dhammadīnnā, who preached to him the Culla Vedalla Sutta), Abhayarājakumāra, Gulissāni, Vacchagotta, Bhūmija, Samiddhi, Aciravata, Sabhiya, Vassaka, Suppabuddha, Pilindavaccha, Jānussoni and the princess Cundī; also Bimbisāra's wife, Khemā, who went to Veluvana because she had heard so much of its beauty.  Sāriputta and Ananda visited the Buddha there on several occasions, sometimes alone, sometimes in the company of others, and Ananda lived there for some time after the Buddha's death, and during his stay there preached the Gopakamoggallāna Sutta.  [/p][p]Sāriputta is mentioned as having held discussions there with, among others, Candikāputta and Lāludāyī.  A sermon preached by Mahā Kassapa to the monks at Veluvana is given at A.v.161ff.; for other suttas preached by the Buddha, see also S.i.231; ii.32, 183, 242, 254; iv.20; v.446; Ud.iv.9.[/p][p]It is said that Māra visited Veluvana several times (E.g., S.i.106f ) in order to work his will on the Buddha.  The Buddha was there when three of the monks committed suicide - Vakkali, Godhika and Channa - and he had to pronounce them free from blame.  News was brought to the Buddha, at Veluvana, of the illness of three of his disciples - Assaji, Moggallāna and Dīghāvu - and he set out to visit them and comfort them with talks on the doctrine.  Near Veluvana was a Paribbājaka Rāma, where the Buddha sometimes went with some of his disciples in the course of his alms rounds.  Two of his discussions there are recorded in the Cūla- and Mahā Sakuladāyī Suttas.[/p][p]During the Buddha's lifetime, two thūpas were erected at the gate of Veluvana, one containing the relics of Aññā Kondañña (SA.i.219), and the other those of Moggallāna (J.v.127).[/p][p]Veluvana was so called because it was surrounded by bamboos (velu).  It was surrounded by a wall, eighteen cubits high, holding a gateway and towers (SNA.ii.419; Sp.iii.576).[/p][p]After the Buddha's death, Dāsaka, Upāli's pupil, lived at Veluvana, and there ordained Sonaka with fifty five companions.  From there Sonaka went to the Kukkutārāma.  (Mhv.v.115 f, 122; Dpv.iv.39).[/p][p]The dedication of Veluvana was among the scenes depicted in the Relic Chamber of the Mahā Thūpa (Mhv.xxx.80).[/p][p]On one side of the main building of the Veluvana vihāra was a building called Ambalatthika (MA.ii.635).  There was also a senāsana, built for the use of monks practising austerities (MA.ii.932).[/p][p]It is said that, after death, Vassakāra was born as a monkey in Veluvana and answered to his name.  He had been told during his lifetime that this destiny awaited him, and therefore took the precaution of seeing that the place was well supplied with fruit trees (MA.ii.854).[/p][p]According to Hiouen Thsang (Beal, op.  cit., ii.159), the Kalandaka nivāpa (Karandavenuvana, as he calls it) lay one li to the north of Rājagaha.[/p][hr][p][b]2. Veluvana.  [/b] A bamboo grove in Kajangalā, where the Buddha once stayed.

It was given by him to the Sāgalikas (Cv.xlii.43).  It probably lay between Anurādhapura and Manihīra, and Sanghatissa once lay in hiding there disguised as a monk (Cv.xliv.29; Cv.Trs.i.77, n.2).  Jetthatissa III.  gave to the vihāra the village of Kakkalavitthi.  Cv.xliv.99.[/p][hr][p][b]5. Veluvana.[/b] A monastery erected by Parakkamabāhu I.  in the suburb of Vijita in Pulatthipura.  It consisted of three image houses, each three storeys high, a thūpa, a cloister, a two storeyed pāsāda, four gateways, four long pāsādas, eight small ones, one refectory, one sermon hall, seven fire hoses and twelve privies.

  <entry>[div class="huge"]Vetullavāda[/div][p]A heretical doctrine which was introduced into Ceylon by Vohārika Tissa, but was suppressed by his minister Kapila (Mhv.xxxvi.41; Dpv.xxii.40).  It appeared again later, and though officially disapproved, it does seem to have pushed its way among the monks of Ceylon, chiefly the Dhammarucikas (q.v.).  E.g., in the reigns of Gothabhaya (Mhv.xxxvi.111), Mahāsena, (xxxvii.1ff.), and Aggabodhi I.  (Cv.xlii.35).  [/p][p]Vetullavāda is generally identified with the Mahāyāna school of Buddhism.  See Mhv.  Trs.  259, n.2; also Hocart, Memoirs of the Archaeol.  Survey of Ceylon, i.1922, p.15ff.[/p][p]The Vetulla Pitaka, the canon of the Vetullavādins, is condemned as abuddhavacana.

As in the  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/cuula_sakuladaayi_s,Culla Sakuladāyī Suttas')"]Culla Sakuladāyī Suttas[/a], the Buddha says that what Vekhanassa defines as perfection is merely a refinement of pleasure, and that only arahants can grasp the real meaning of perfection.  Vekhanassa is annoyed, but the Buddha soothes him, and he becomes the Buddha's follower (M.ii.40ff).[/p][p]In the sutta Vekhanassa is called Kaccāna.  The Commentary (MA.ii.716) says that Vekhanassa visited the Buddha because he wished to discover for himself why his favourite pupil,  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sakuladaayii,Sakuludāyī')"]Sakuludāyī[/a], should have been defeated by the Buddha; he, therefore, travelled all the way from Rājagaha to Sāvatthi, a distance of forty five leagues, to see the Buddha.[/p][hr]</entry>

  <entry>[div class="huge"]Vejayanta[/div][hr][p][b]1. Vejayanta.[/b] A pāsāda belonging to Sakka.  When Moggallāna visited Sakka to discover if he had fully understood the Buddha's teaching in the Cūlatanhā sankhaya Sutta, Sakka tried to evade his questions by showing him this palace.  It has one hundred towers, each seven stories high, with seven nymphs in each storey, waited on by seven attendants.  The palace appeared in Tāvatimsa on the day of Sakka's decisive victory over the Asuras.  Moggallāna allowed himself to be shown round, and then, with his big toe, he made the palace quake and rock.  M.i.252f.; cf.  Thag.  1196f.; ThagA.ii.184. The palace was also made to rock by the novice Sangharakkhita (q.v.) on the day he joined the Order (DA.ii.558).  [/p][p]The palace is one thousand leagues high, and is so called because it arose in the hour of victory (J.i.203).  It is decked with banners, each three hundred leagues long banners of gold on jewelled staffs and vice versa; and the whole palace is built of the seven precious substances.  It arose as the result of the rest house built by Sakka, in his birth as Magha, for the use of the multitude (DhA.i.273; cf.  DA.iii.698).  When the Buddha visited Tāvatimsa with Nanda, Sakka was in the palace with his crimson footed (kakutapādiniyo) nymphs and came forward with them to greet him.  The nymphs had given oil for the massaging of Kassapa Buddha's feet, hence the colour of their own feet.  SNA.i.274.[/p][p]When King Sādhīna of Mithilā went to Tāvatimsa, he lived, according to human computation, seven hundred years in Vejayanta (J.iv.357).[/p][p]The Vejayantapāsāda is illustrated on the Bharhut Tope.

Sakka rode into battle in this chariot (J.i.202), and it was sent to fetch distinguished humans to Tāvatimsa e.g., Nimi, Guttila and Sādhīna (q.v.).  The Sudhābhojana Jātaka (J.v.408f ) contains a description of the chariot with its pole of gold and its framework overlaid with gilt representations of various animals and birds.  When the chariot travelled the whole world was filled with the sound of its wheels.[/p][hr][p][b]3. Vejayanta.[/b] The chief of the eighty four thousand chariots owned by Mahāsudassana (S.iii.145; D.ii.187).
