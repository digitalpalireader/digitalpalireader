<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Pútimamsa Játaka (No. 437)&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once, on the slopes of the Himálaya, lived a jackal called Pútimamsa with his mate Vení. Near by dwelt a flock of wild goats. Pútimamsa formed a device for killing the goats one by one and eating their flesh, till only a she goat, called Melamátá, was left. Wishing to devour her as well, Pútimamsa suggested to Vení that he should pretend to be dead and that Vení should then entice Melamátá into the cave by asking her to assist in the funeral rites. But the goat was wise and observant and discovered the ruse. Vení went to her later and saying that Pútimamsa had recovered consciousness at the very sight of her, invited her to join them in a feast to celebrate his recovery. Melamátá, agreed, saying that she would bring with her a large escort of her friends, fierce dogs, including Maliya, Pingiya, Caturakkha and Jambuka, in order that the celebration might be a great one. At this suggestion Pútimamsa and Vení fled from their cave, taking rescue elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told to the monks in order to impress on them the necessity for keeping guard over their senses. J.iii.532ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

It was among the suttas preached at the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/maha_samaya_s')"&gt;Mahásamaya&lt;/a&gt; in answer to the questions asked of the Buddha by the created Buddha (SNA.ii.548). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is a long disquisition on the characteristics of a calm sage (upasanta). He is free from craving, anger, etc., is equable and thoughtful, possessed of calm, and walk's in the path of righteous men (SN. vs. 848 61).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sutta was preached for the benefit of the buddhi caritá.

But the king, listening to his enemies, sent the Bodhisatta away from the court, and he dwelt in a village of Kási. Later, the king, remembering his chaplain's goodness, composed a verse, wrote it on a leaf, and sent it to him, together with cooked crow's flesh. The Bodhisatta understood the message and returned to the court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related in reference to the great wisdom of the Buddha. Ananda is identified with the king (J.ii.173 5). The Játaka derives its name from the first two words of the verse composed by the king.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Meeting the Buddha in a wood outside the town, he greeted him, and was addressed by the Buddha as &quot;householder,&quot; at which he was very angry, for he had, so he said, handed over his wealth to his sons, and possessed only his food and clothing. But the Buddha told him that true retirement from the household meant far more than that, and, at the request of Potaliya, he proceeded to explain his words. At the end of the discourse Potaliya declared himself the Buddha's follower. M.i.359 ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;2. Potaliya&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;A wanderer (Paribbájáka) probably identical with the above (1). A conversation he had with the Buddha is recorded in the Anguttara Nikáya.

He was born in Sudhañña (Sudassana) and his mother was Sucandá (Candá). He was called Piyadassí because he showed many pleasing miracles. For nine thousand years he lived as a layman in three palaces: Sunimala Vimala and Giriguhá (Giribrahá). His wife was Vimalá and his son Kañcanavela (Kañcana). He left home in a chariot and practised austerities for six months. He was given milk rice by Vasabha's daughter and grass for his seat by the Ajívaka Sujáta. His, bodhi was a Kakudha tree. Among his converts were the deva king Sudassana and the elephant Donamukha. A monk named Sona conspired with Prince Mahápaduma to kill the Buddha, Donamukha being the elephant they used in their unsuccessful plot. cp. Nálágiri.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Piyadassí's chief disciples were Pálita and Sabbadassí among monks and Sujátá and Dhammadinná among nuns, his constant attendant being Sobhita. Sannaka and Dhammika were his chief lay patrons among men, and Visákhi and Dhammadinná among women. He lived for ninety thousand years and died at Assattháráma, his thúpa being three leagues in height.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bodhisatta of that time was a brahmin named Kassapa, and he built a monastery for the Buddha at a cost of one hundred thousand crores.

Piyadassí Thera&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;An arahant. He was present with sixty thousand others, from Jetáráma, at the foundation ceremony of the Mahá Thúpa (Dpv.xix.15; Mhv.xxix.32). He stood on the north east side at the ceremony, and at the close of it he preached to Dutthagámaní. Ibid., 65; MT. 531.&lt;/p&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Posiya Thera&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The son of a very rich banker in Sávatthi and the younger brother of Sangámajita. When grown up, he married and had a son. Soon after, he left the world to join the Order and, dwelling alone in the forest, became an arahant. Once, when he went to Sávatthi to worship the Buddha, he visited his home. His former wife entertained him, but when he saw that she was trying to tempt him, he hurried away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Tissa Buddha he was a hunter. The Buddha, out of compassion for him, went to the forest and stood near him. He provided the Buddha with a seat of grass and paid him homage. Soon after, he was killed by a lion (Thag.vs.34; ThagA.i.96 ff). He is probably identical with Tinamutthidáyaka of the Apadána. Ap.i.280; see also ii. p.455.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Near a village, on the outskirts of the forest, grew a kimpakka-tree, which, in every respect, resembled a mango tree. Some of the men ate of it, and their leader, when he knew this, gave them medicine which cured them. The next day the villagers rushed up to the tree hoping to find all the members of the caravan dead, like those of former caravans, leaving the villagers to rob their goods. They were amazed on finding these men alive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to a gardener employed by a squire in Sávatthi. He took some monks round the garden and was amazed to find that they could tell the condition of a mango by looking at the tree. J.i.270 ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Cv.lxxix.11.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;2. Pulacceri&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;A landing place in Ceylon where Mágha and Jayabáhu set up fortifications. Cv.lxxxiii.17.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pulatthi nagara( pura). A capital of the Singhalese kings. It is first heard of in the reign of Aggabodhi III., who built in the town the Mahápánadípa vihára (Cv.xliv.122). But it was probably an important centre even earlier, and Vijitapura, wrested from the Tamils by Dutthagámaní, was probably near by (See Codrington, op. cit., 20). Sena I. first made Pulatthipura the capital (Cv.l.9, 46, 85), though even before his time it seems to have been used as a royal residence - e.g., by Aggabodhi IV. (Cv.xlvi.34), Aggabodhi VII. (Ibid.,xlviii.74), and Udaya I. (Ibid.,xlix.9, 18), who built a hospital there. Kassapa IV.is also mentioned as building a hospital against an epidemic (Cv.lii.25). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mahinda II. built in the city the Dámavihára parivena and the Sanníratittha vihára (Cv.xlviii.134). Sena I. reigned in Pulatthipura for twenty years and erected there several buildings, including the Senaggabodhi shrine near the Thusavápí (Ibid.,l.73). The successors of Sena I. found in Pulatthipura a certain amount of protection from the inroads of the Colas and the Pándiyans; but in the time of Sena V. the town fell into the hands of the Damilas, through the treachery of Sena's mother and his commander in chief, Sena. But Sena V. recovered the city by making a treaty with his commander in chief (Ibid., liv.64, 68). About 1017 A.C. the Colas overran the country, captured Pulatthipura, and made the reigning king, Mahinda V., their prisoner. He died, after twelve years, as a prisoner in India (Ibid.,lv.22ff). During this </data>
<data>period many of the Hindu shrines in the city were erected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For many years the Colas held the sovereignty of the city, though the Singhalese made several vain attempts to drive them out. The Colas named the city Jananáthapura and put down all rebellion with a strong hand. Finally, a young prince named Kitti, born about 1039 A.C., assumed the title of Vijayabáhu and determined to rescue Pulatthipura. His first attempts failed, partly owing to rebellion among his own people; but finally, civil war broke out in the Cola country itself, and thus, about 1070, he captured Pulatthipura after a great deal of fierce fighting both on sea and land. But, owing to dissensions among his subjects, it was only several years later that he was able to hold his coronation (Cv.lvii.66; lviii.22 ff.; lix.6 ff). He renamed the city Vijayarájapura, and erected there many religious buildings, chief among which was the Temple of the Tooth Relic (Ibid.,lx.2ff). It was not, however, till the time of Parakkamabáhu I. that Palatthipura reached the pinnacle of its greatness. He enlarged it to the size of four gávutas in length and seven in width and called it Parakkamapura. The city had three suburbs   Rávjavesíbhujanga, Rájakulantaka and Vijita -  and fourteen gates. Parakkama adorned it with various parks, chief of which were the Nandanavana and the Dípuyyána, and with ponds and numerous buildings, both secular and religious (for details see chiefly Cv.lxxiii.1ff.; lxxviii.44 ff). Kittinissanka added a stone temple for the Tooth Relic (Ibid., lxxx.19). In the reign of Lílavatí, Lokissara captured the city and ruled there for nine months. He was ousted by the general Parakkama, and later Parakkamapandu ruled as king, till he was deposed about 1215 A.C. by Mágha of the Kalinga race, who, coming with a large host of Keralas and Malabars, captured the city and mercilessly </data>
<data>plundered its possessions (Ibid., lxxxiii.15 ff). From this spoliation the city never completely recovered, and it gradually lost its importance, though Parakkamabáhu II., Vijayabáhu IV. and Parakkamabáhu III. made attempts to restore it to its original splendour. Ibid., lxxxvii.67; lxxxviii.28, 35, 89, 92, 120f.; lxxxix.1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Pinda Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the Buddha was at Pañcasálá when the day came for all young people to send gifts to each other. The Buddha went to the village for alms, but the villagers, influenced by Mára, gave him nothing, and he returned with his empty bowl. Mára tried to influence the Buddha to go a second time, but this he refused to do (S.i.113; the incident is also found at DhA.iii., p. 257f). The Commentary says (SA.i.141) that Mára did not want the Buddha to accept the gifts of the maidens and to preach to them, because then they would pass beyond his evil influence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Most of the incidents mentioned are not to be found in the Játakas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This chapter is described as a Buddhápadána (Ibid., 301), but there is no reference either to it or to the incidents recounted in the chapter entitled Buddhápadána which is found at the beginning of the Apadána.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;See also Pilotikamma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

The man, however, disagreed with this view and did not scruple to say so wherever he went.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/pasenadi')"&gt;Pasenadi&lt;/a&gt; taunted&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/mallikaa')"&gt;Malliká&lt;/a&gt; with this, and she sent Nálijangha to the Buddha to ask if these were his words. The Buddha convinced him by means of various examples that the statement was true, and when this was reported to Malliká, she was able to prove to Pasenadi that the Buddha's teaching was in accordance with facts.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Punna&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;1. Punna, Punnaka Thera&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was born in the family of a householder of Suppáraka in the Sunáparanta country. When he was grown up, he went with a great caravan of merchandise to Sávatthi where, having heard the Buddha preach, he left the world and joined the Order. He won favour by attention to his duties. One day he asked the Buddha for a short lesson so that, having learnt it, he might go back to dwell in Sunáparanta. The Buddha preached to him the Punnováda Sutta (q.v.). So Punna departed, and, in Sunáparanta, he became an arahant. There he won over many disciples, both male and female, and having built for the Buddha a cell out of red sandalwood (Candanásálá), he sent him a flower by way of invitation. The Buddha came with five hundred arahants, spent a night in the cell, and went away before dawn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ninety one kappas ago, when there was no Buddha alive, Punna was a learned brahmin, and later became a hermit in Himavá. Near his abode a Pacceka Buddha died, and at the moment of his death there appeared a great radiance. The ascetic cremated the body and sprinkled scented water on the pyre to extinguish the flames. A deva, witnessing the event, prophesied his future greatness. His name throughout his many lives was Punna or Punnaka. Thag. vs. 70; ThagA.i.156 ff.; Ap.ii.341.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Sunáparanta he first lived at Ambahatthapabbata, but, on being recognised by his brother, he went to Samuddagiri vihára, where was a magnetised walk which none could use. The waves of the sea breaking made great noise, and, in order to help him to concentration, Punna caused the sea to be quiet. From there he went to Mátulagiri, where the incessant cries of birds disturbed him; he finally went to Makulakagáma. While he was there, his brother </data>
<data>Cúla Punna, with five hundred others, sailed in a trading ship, and, before embarking, he visited Punna, took the precepts from him, and asked for his protection during the voyage. The ship reached an island where red sandalwood grew; with this the merchants filled the ship, and the spirits of the island, angered by this, raised a great storm and appeared before the sailors in fearful forms. Each merchant thought of his guardian deity and Cúla Punna of his brother. Punna, sensing his brother's need, travelled through the air to the ship, and, at sight of him, the spirits disappeared. In gratitude for their deliverance, the merchants gave to the Elder a share of their sandalwood. It was with this material that the Candanasálá, above referred to, was built.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kundadhána was the first among the arahants to be chosen to accompany the Buddha to Sunáparanta. Sakka provided five hundred palanquins for the journey, one of which was empty. This was subsequently taken by the ascetic Saccabandha, whom the Buddha converted and ordained on the way. On his return journey, the Buddha stopped at the river Nammadá, and was entertained there by the Nága king. MA.ii.1014 ff.; SA.iii.14ff.; KhA.149.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;2. Punna, Punnaka&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;A setthi of Rájagaha (DhA.i.385; iii.104), father of Uttará Nanda-Mátá. He had been a poor man and had worked for the setthi Sumana. One feast day, though his master offered him a holiday, he went to work in the field, because he was too poor to be able to enjoy himself. While he was in the field Sáriputta came to him, and Punna gave him a tooth stick and water. Punna's wife, coming with her husband's food, met Sáriputta as he was coming away, and offered him the food she carried. She cooked fresh rice and took it to her husband, who was overjoyed to hear of her gift to Sáriputta. After the meal, he </data>
<data>rested his head for a while on his wife's lap, and, on awaking, he found that the field he had ploughed had turned into gold. He reported the matter to the king, who sent carts to fetch the gold; but as soon as his men touched it, saying that it was for the king, it turned again into earth. The gold was, therefore, gathered in Punna's name, and the king conferred on him the rank of Bahudhanasetthi. He built a new house, and, at the feast of inauguration, held a great almsgiving to the Buddha and the monks. When the Buddha thanked him, he and his wife and his daughter Uttará (q.v.) became sotápannas. MA.ii.812; DhA.iii.302 ff.; also VvA.62ff., where Punnaka's wife is called Uttará. In the Anguttara, Commentary (i. 240 ff.) the man's name is given as Punnasíha, of which Punna is the shortened form.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is this Punna, described as bhataka, that is mentioned in the Milindapañha (pp. 115, 291; see also MA.ii.812) among the seven people whose acts of devotion brought reward in this very life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;3. Punna&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slave of Mendaka (q.v.). He was one of the five persons of Great Merit (Pañca Mahápuññá) (AA.i.219; DhA.i.385). When he ploughed the field with a single plough he made fourteen furrows, seven on each side. Vsm.383.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;4. Punna&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;A servitor (dabbigáhaka) who held the oblation ladles for the seven sages, mentioned in the Assaláyana Sutta (M.ii.157; MA.ii.785); they were rebuked by Asita Devala for their pretensions regarding the superiority of brahmins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;5. Punna Koliyaputta&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;A naked ascetic (Acela) who visited the Buddha at Haliddavasana, together with Seniya Kukkuravatika. Punna questioned the Buddha regarding the practices of Seniya, while Seniya did likewise regarding those of Punna. The discussion is recorded in the Kukkuravatika Sutta (q.v.). At the end </data>
<data>of the discussion, Punna declared himself a follower of the Buddha. He is called Govatika (one who behaved like a cow) (M.i.387 ff). Buddhaghosa says (MA.ii.624) that, in order to support his bovine character, he wore horns and a tail and browsed on the grass in the company of cattle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;6. Punna &lt;a name="Mantaniputta"&gt;Mantáníputta&lt;/a&gt; Thera&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;He belonged to a brahmin family of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/d2_v')"&gt;Donavatthu&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kapilavatthu')"&gt;Kapilavatthu&lt;/a&gt;.

Kondañña then returned to Rájagaha, whence, having taken leave of the Buddha, he retired to live on the banks of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/chaddanta')"&gt;Chaddantadaha&lt;/a&gt;. But Punna remained in Kapilavatthu, intent on his practices, and soon after became an arahant. He gathered round him five hundred clansmen who all became monks, and he taught them the ten bases of discourse (dasa kathávatthúni), which he himself had learnt, and they became arahants. When they wished to visit the Buddha, Punna sent them on in advance to Rájagaha, asking them to pay homage to the Buddha in his name. Later, when the Buddha came from Rájagaha to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/saavatthi')"&gt;Sávatthi&lt;/a&gt;, Punna visited him and was taught the Dhamma in the Buddha's own &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/g/gandhakuti')"&gt;Gandhakuti&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/saariputta')"&gt;Sáriputta&lt;/a&gt;, hearing of the fame of Punna, </data>
<data>wished to meet him, and went to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/andhavana')"&gt;Andhavana&lt;/a&gt;, where Punna was spending his siesta. Sáriputta questioned him on the seven acts of purity, and Punna answered him. The two monks found great joy in each other's words. The interview with Sáriputta is given in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/r/rathavinita_s')"&gt;Rathaviníta Sutta&lt;/a&gt; (M.i.146 ff.). &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddhagosa')"&gt;Buddhaghosa&lt;/a&gt;, says (MA.i.362) that the two Elders had many things in common.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later, the Buddha declared Punna to be pre-eminent among those who preached the Dhamma. (A.i.23; S.ii.156)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Padumuttara Buddha, Punna was born in a rich brahmin family of Hamsavatí, before the birth of the Buddha. When grown up, he one day visited the Buddha, and as he sat on the edge of a large crowd, hearing him preach, the Buddha declared one of his monks pre eminent among preachers, and Punna, wishing for a like honour under a future Buddha, paid great homage to Padumuttara. (ThagA.i.37 ff )&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Anguttara Commentary (AA.i.113 ff), however, we are told that in the time of Padumuttara Buddha, Punna was named Gotama and was expert in the Vedas. But he found no solace in the teaching of the Vedas and became an ascetic with a following of eighteen thousand Jatilas, all of whom, under his guidance, developed great iddhi powers. Punna was already old when Padumuttara attained Enlightenment. One day the Buddha visited Gotama's hermitage, and Gotama and his disciples entertained him to a meal. Afterwards the Buddha wished his chief disciple Mahádeva to come to the hermitage with one hundred thousand monks; this he did, and the ascetics provided flowers for their seats. For seven days the Buddha and his monks remained in trance on their seats, at the end of which period the Buddha asked the most pre eminent preacher </data>
<data>to render thanks. At the conclusion of the sermon, all except Gotama became arahants. Gotama wished to gain pre eminence in preaching under a future Buddha, and Padumuttara proclaimed that his wish would find fulfilment. The Apadána (Ap.i.38, quoted at ThagA.i.362) contains yet another version, according to which Punna's name in the time of Padumuttara was Sunanda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides the Rathaviníta Sutta mentioned above (n. 1), which bears testimony to Punna's skill as a preacher, another Sutta, of the Samyutta Nikáya (S.iii.105f.; according to ThagA.ii.124, Ananda became a sotápanna after hearing a sermon by Punna), represents Ananda as saying to the assembled monks that Punna was of great help to himself and others when they were yet novices; Punna had preached to them on causation, and they were able to understand the Doctrine because of his skilful exposition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is, perhaps, this Punna who is identified with the gate keeper (dovárika) of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kurudhamma_jat_276')"&gt;Kurudhamma Játaka&lt;/a&gt; (J.ii.381) and with one of the seven brothers of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bhisa_jat_488')"&gt;Bhisa Játaka&lt;/a&gt; (J.iv.314). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Mahávastu (iii.382) contains twenty verses attributed to Púrna Maitrayáníputra.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;7. Punna. &lt;/b&gt;See also s.v. Punnaka.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Punna Sutta. &lt;/b&gt;Another name for the Punnováda Sutta (q.v.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

When Ajátasattu erected a thúpa over the Buddha's relics at Rájagaha, she started early one morning with four kosátakí flowers to offer at the thúpa. On the way there she was gored to death by a cow, and was reborn in Távatimsa, wearing yellow garments. There Moggallána met her and learned her story.

The Buddha refuses at first to answer the question, but, on being pressed, he says that the truth is that actors are born in the Pahása niraya. Tálaputa thereupon starts to weep to think that he should have been so long deceived. He enters the Order and, in due course, becomes an arahant. S.iv.306f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

When she left Távatimsa, Sakka gave her ten boons: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;to be chief queen, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;to have dark eyes, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;dark eyebrows, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;to be named Phusatí, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;to have a son, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;to keep a slim figure, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;to have firm breasts, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;hair always dark, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;to have soft skin, and &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;to save the condemned. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;She was called Phusatí because on the day of her birth her body smelt of sandal wood.

One day, while meditating, the Buddha appeared before her in a ray of glory and she became an arahant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past she was a kinnarí on the banks of the Candabhágá, and, having seen a Pacceka Buddha, worshipped him with a wreath of reeds. Thig. vs. 3; ThigA. 9f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She is perhaps identical with Tíninalamáliká of the Apadána. Ap.ii.515.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;3. Punná Therí.-(v.l. Punníká)&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;An arahant. She was born in &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/anaathapindika')"&gt;Anáthapindika's&lt;/a&gt; household, as the daughter of a domestic slave. She was called Punna because, with her birth, the number of children in the household reached one hundred.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the day, on which she heard the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/siihanaada')"&gt;Síhanáda Sutta&lt;/a&gt; she became a sotápanna. She converted the brahmin &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/sotthiya')"&gt;Sotthiya&lt;/a&gt;, who believed in purification through water (the conversation is recorded in Thig. vs. 236 51), and thereby won the esteem of Anáthapindika, so that he freed her. Thereupon she entered the Order and in due course became an arahant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Vipassí Buddha she was born in a clansman's family and entered the Order. She learned the three Pitakas and became a distinguished preacher. She did the same under five other Buddhas - Sikhí, Vessabhú, Kakusandha, Konágamana and Kassapa   but, owing to her </data>
<data>tendency to pride, she was unable to root out the defilements. ThigA. 199 ff.; Ap.ii.611.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buddhaghosa, however, say of this Therí (MA.i.347f.; the story, with very different details, is given in AA.ii.716f) that she was a slave girl of Anáthapindika. On one occasion, when the Buddha was about to set out on a tour, Anáthapindika and the other chief patrons of the Buddha, loth to lose him for several months, begged him to remain with them. But the Buddha declined this request, and Punná, seeing Anáthapindika very dejected and learning the reason, offered to persuade the Buddha to stay. So she approached him and said that she would take the Three Refuges with the Five Precepts if he would postpone his tour. The Buddha at once agreed, and Punná was freed and adopted as Anáthapindika's daughter. She later joined the Order, and became an arahant after listening to an admonition (Therigáthá, vs.3, about Punná 2) of the Buddha, who appeared before her in a ray of glory. Here we undoubtedly have a confusion of legends. See Punná (2).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It may be this same Punná who is mentioned in the Milindapañha (p.115) as one of the seven people whose acts of devotion brought them recompense in this very life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;4. Punná&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The slave girl of the brahmin soothsayer of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/n/nanachanda_jat_289')"&gt;Nánacchanda Játaka&lt;/a&gt;. When asked what boon she desired, she answered, “A pestle and mortar and a winnowing basket.&quot; J.ii.428, 429.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;5. Punná&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;A slave woman of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/r/raajagaha')"&gt;Rájagaha&lt;/a&gt;. Late one night, when standing outside the house, cooling herself after having pounded a large quantity of rice, she saw &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/dabba_mallaputta_th')"&gt;Dabba Mallaputta&lt;/a&gt; taking some monks to their lodgings. She thought </data>
<data>to herself that she had to work and therefore could not sleep early, but why should monks, who are free from care, be sleepless? She concluded that one of them was sick or had been bitten by a snake. At dawn the next day she went down to the bathing-ghat, taking a cake made of rice dust and baked over charcoal, meaning to eat it after the bath. On the way she met the Buddha and offered him the cake, though she did not expect he would eat it. But the Buddha, who was with &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/aa/aananda')"&gt;Ananda&lt;/a&gt;, accepted the gift and sat down to eat it, while Punná stood watching. When the meal was over, the Buddha asked her what she had thought of the monks, and she told him. The Buddha pointed out to her that monks could not sleep till late for they had to be watchful and assiduous. At the end of the discourse Punná became a &lt;a href="http://www.palikanon.com/english/wtb/s_t/sotaapanna')"&gt;sotápanna&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was in reference to this Punná that the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kundakakucchisindhava_jat_254')"&gt;Kundakasindhavapotaka Játaka&lt;/a&gt; was preached. DhA.iii.321 ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name="6"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;. Punná&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;A slave woman. The Commentaries mention (E.g., MA.ii.696) that the Buddha once made a rag robe (pamsukúla) out of a garment cast off by her in a cemetery overgrown with weeds (atimuttakasusána). When the Buddha donned the robe the earth trembled in wonder. It was this robe that the Buddha exchanged with &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/maha_kassapa_th')"&gt;Mahá Kassapa&lt;/a&gt;; when the Buddha picked it up from the cemetery where Punná had cast it off it was covered with insects (SA.ii.149).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Having won the flags of three countries, he went on a visit to Ceylon and was honoured by the king. While passing the door of the Kiñjakásanasálá, he heard a monk reciting the &quot;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/n/n2_ny')"&gt;Na tumháka&lt;/a&gt;&quot; Vagga, and, touched thereby, he went to the Mahávihára and joined the Order.

When his legs ached he walked about on his knees. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One day a hunter, mistaking him for an animal, shot at him. The dart pierced him, but he filled the wound with herbs, lay down on a slab of rock, developed insight and attained arahantship. To the monks who gathered round him he expressed his great joy at having succeeded in his quest, and they said that had the Buddha been alive he would have stroked his head (MA.i.190). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His story is given as an example of a monk striving amid great discomfort.

M.iii.69; ApA.i.106.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Pindola Sutta&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha explains to some monks at the Ghositáráma that Pindola Bháradvája had realized truth through having cultivated three controlling faculties: mindfulness, concentration, and insight. These accomplish the destruction of birth, old age, and death. S.v.224f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Pindola Bháradvája&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The son of the chaplain of King &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/udena')"&gt;Udena&lt;/a&gt; of&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kosambii')"&gt;Kosambí&lt;/a&gt;. He belonged to the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bhaaradvaaja')"&gt;Bháradvájagotta&lt;/a&gt;. He learnt the Vedas and became a successful teacher, but, finding his work distasteful, he went to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/r/raajagaha')"&gt;Rájagaha&lt;/a&gt;. There he saw the gifts and favours bestowed on the Buddha's disciples and joined the Order. He was very greedy, and went about with a large bowl made of dried gourd, which he kept under his bed at night and which made a scraping sound when touched; but the Buddha refused to allow him a bag for it until it should be worn down by constant contact. Later he followed the Buddha's advice, conquered his intemperance in diet, and became an arahant. He then announced before the Buddha his readiness to answer the questions of any doubting monks, thus uttering his &quot;lion's roar.&quot; The Buddha declared him chief of the &quot;lion roarers.&quot; (A.i.23; AA.i.112f.; ThagA.i.245f.; UdA. 252; SA.iii.26). The Udána (iv.6) contains the praise uttered by him of the Buddha, because of his perfected self mastery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pindola was in the habit of taking his siesta in Udena's </data>
<data>park at Kosambí. (He had been king in a former birth and had spent many days in that park.) One day Udena's women, who had come to the park with him, left him asleep and crowded round Pindola to hear him preach. Udena, noticing their absence, went in search of them, and, in his anger, ordered a nest of red ants to be put on Pindola's body. But Pindola vanished and returned to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/saavatthi')"&gt;Sávatthi&lt;/a&gt;, where the Buddha related the Mahánága Játaka* and also the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/g/guhatthaka_s')"&gt;Guhatthaka Sutta&lt;/a&gt; (SNA.ii.514f). Later, (S.iv.110f.; SA.iii.26) we find Udena consulting him at the same spot and following his advice regarding the control of the senses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;* J.iv.375 ff.; SA.iii.26 says that when the king went   to fetch the red ants from an asoka tree, the ants fell on him and started to   sting him. The women, under pretence of helping him, picked up the ants that   fell from him and replaced them on his body, because they were angry at his   rudeness to Pindola.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Vinaya (Vin.ii.110f.; the story is given in greater detail at DhA.iii.201ff.; see also J.iv.263) we find the Buddha rebuking Pindola for performing a cheap miracle. The setthi of Rájagaha had placed a sandal wood bowl on a high pole and challenged any holy person to bring it down. Pindola heard of this and, at Moggallána's suggestion, rose in the air by magic power and brought it down. The Buddha blamed him for using his great gifts for an unworthy end. The bowl was given to the monks to be ground into sandal paste.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/padumuttara')"&gt;Padumuttara&lt;/a&gt; Buddha, Pindola had been a lion in &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/h/himava')"&gt;Himavá&lt;/a&gt;. The Buddha visited the lion in his cave, who waited on him for seven </data>
<data>days, paying him great honour. Later, the lion died and was reborn in &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/h/hamsavatii')"&gt;Hamsavatí&lt;/a&gt;, where he heard the Buddha preach and declare one of his disciples chief of the &quot;lion roarers.&quot; Eight kappas ago he was a king named Paduma. AA.i.111f.; Ap.i.50f.; ThagA.i.244f.; the last seems to identify him with Piyálaphaladáyaka of the Apadána.

It was the custom of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddha')"&gt;Buddha&lt;/a&gt; to spend his siesta there after eating at the house of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/anaathapindika')"&gt;Anáthapindika&lt;/a&gt; (DhA.i.413; see also MA.i.369). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Pubbáráma, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/visaakhaa')"&gt;Visákhá&lt;/a&gt; erected the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/me_mu/migaramatupasada')"&gt;Migáramátupásáda&lt;/a&gt;, the site costing her nine crores and the building another nine (DhA.i.413).

The Treasurer suspected them, and promised to join them on his way back from the palace. But on his return the vessels which contained the liquor were still quite full; he therefore charged the men with the intent to poison him, or they would have drunk some of the liquor during his absence. They then ran away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told to Anáthapindika, who had a similar experience. But in this case he was returning from the palace, and challenged the rogue's to taste their own liquor first. J.i.268 ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

When the king died they returned to Benares and on the way someone gave the prince a bowl of food asking share it with his wife; but he ate it all, and even when he became king and she his queen, he showed her very little honour. The Bodhisatta, who was the king's counsellor, perceiving this, asked the queen to speak to the king about his neglect of her. The king confessed his fault, and thereafter showed the queen great honour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related to a landowner of Sávatthi who once went with his wife into the country to collect a debt. On the way back, when they were famishing, someone gave a meal to be shared by them. But the man, deceiving his wife, sent her on ahead and ate the food himself. The wife, on visiting the Buddha, spoke to him of this. The two couples were identical. J.ii.202ff. Cp. Godha Játaka.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Urged by her desire, the husband stole at night into the king's conservatories to get the safflowers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was caught by the guard and impaled alive.

Once when he lay there grievously ill, the Buddha visited him and cheered him by talking to him of the seven bojjhangas (S.v.79). On another occasion, Mahá Kassapa spent several days there in a trance, and when, at the end of that period, he entered Rájagaha for alms, Sakka, with Sujátá, waited for him in the guise of a weaver, and his wife gave him a meal. When Kassapa discovered this, he asked Sakka not to do such a thing again; but the Buddha heard Sakka's song of triumph when his meal was accepted and praised him for his gift (Ud.iii.7; UdA.195f.; DhA.i.427f.; see also Ud.i.6). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On another occasion, when Kassapa was in the Pipphaliguhá, he had two novices waiting on him. One was lazy and a liar and took the credit for the work, all of which was done by the other. Kassapa admonished him, and he then set fire to the Elder's hut and ran away (DhA.ii.19f). One day, as Kassapa sat in the Pipphaliguhá, he tried to contemplate the rising and falling of living beings, but the Buddha discouraged him, saying that such a task was beyond his abilities (DhA.i.258f). The goddess Lájá (q.v.), who had been born in Távatimsa as a reward for a meal which she once gave to Kassapa, attempted to sweep his cell in the Pipphaliguhá and to look after it, but Kassapa rejected her services.

The Buddha has thoroughly penetrated the world condition (lokadhamma) of the world of sankháras. He is like a lotus, sprung from the water and come to full growth therein, yet unspotted by it.

In the Samyutta Nikáya (S.iv.52) he is represented as asking the Buddha if it were possible, by means of any of the senses, to recognize and proclaim the past Buddhas. The Buddha replies in the negative. It is probably the same monk who is mentioned in the Anguttara Nikáya (A.iii.379 ff) as having been visited during his illness by the Buddha on the suggestion of Ananda. The Buddha found Phagguna in bed and grievously ill, and he talked to him and comforted him. Phagguna died soon after, having attained arahantship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;2.

For details see the Dasannaka Játaka. Pukkusa is identified with Sáriputta. J.iii.341.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;2. Pukkusa&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the four ministers of Vedeha, king of Mithilá. He joined with his three companions in a conspiracy against Mahosadha, stealing a golden necklace from the king's palace in order to try and implicate Mahosadha. The details are given in the Maháummagga Játaka (J.vi.330ff). On Pukkusa's thigh was a leprous spot, which he hid from the king because the king loved to lay his head on Pukkusa's lap. Only his younger brother knew of this secret; but it was discovered later by Mahosadha, and Pukkusa was sent to prison. Pukkusa is identified with Potthápáda. Ibid., 478.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;3. Pukkusa&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Mallarájaputta. He was a disciple of Alára Kálama, and one day, while on his way from Kusinárá to Pává, he saw the Buddha seated under a tree by the roadside and stayed to talk to him. He mentioned that once five hundred carts had passed by where Álára sat, and yet so deep was he in meditation that he had failed to notice them. The Buddha told him how, when he himself was in Atumá in the Bhuságára, there was a great thunderstorm which killed two peasants and four oxen, but that he had heard and seen nothing, so deep was his concentration. Pukkusa was greatly impressed by this statement, and, having declared himself a follower of the Buddha, he gave to the Buddha two robes of cloth of gold, one of which, at the Buddha's suggestion, he handed to Ananda. When Pukkusa had left, Ananda draped one robe over the Buddha, and was greatly astonished at its pale appearance in comparison with the deep gold of the Buddha's body (D.ii.130ff). &lt;/p&gt;</data>
<data>&lt;p&gt;Buddhaghosa says (DA.ii.569) that Pukkusa was a merchant, and was the owner of the five hundred carts which had crossed the Kakkutthá (q.v.) shortly before the incident above mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;4. Pukkusa&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The name of a caste, classified among the despised castes (E.g., A.ii.85; M.ii.152). The Commentary explains (E.g., AA.ii.523) them as &quot;those who sweep up flowers which are offered at shrines and are not removed by the devotees who have given them.&quot; The word Pukkusa was evidently not despised as a personal name because, in the case of Pukkusa (3), for instance, the person bearing the name was a khattiya.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Moggallána gave the fruits to the Buddha, who gave one each to Sáriputta, Mahá Kassapa and Moggallána. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Bimbisára heard of what his gardener had done he was greatly pleased, and granted him a village and made him other presents.

Pilinda was his personal name, Vaccha being that of his family. He became a recluse and learnt the Cúla Gandhára vijjá, but, when the Buddha appeared, the charm refused to work. Having heard that the Mahá Gandhára prevented the working of the Cúla Gandhára and having concluded that the Buddha knew the former, he entered the Order at the Buddha's suggestion, in order to acquire it. The Buddha gave him exercises in meditation, and he became an arahant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Certain devas who had been born in the deva world as a result of Pilinda's guidance in a former birth, out of gratitude, waited on him morning and evening. He thus became famous as being dear to the devas, and was declared by the Buddha to be chief among such monks (A.i.24).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Padumuttara Buddha, he was a rich householder of Hamsavatí and wished to become a monk beloved of the devas. In the time of Sumedhá Buddha be was born in the world of men and paid great honour to the Buddha's Thúpa. In a later existence he was a cakkavatti, named Varuna, and established his subjects in righteousness, so that after death they were born in heaven (ThagA.i.51f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pilinda had a habit of addressing everyone as Vasala (outcaste). When this was reported to the Buddha he explained that this was because Pilinda had, for one hundred lives, been born among Vasalavádí-Brahmins (Ud.iii.6; DhA.iv.181f). One day, on entering Rájagaha, Pilinda met a man carrying a bowl of pipphalí (long pepper). “What's in thy bowl, Vasala?&quot; he asked, and the man, in anger, said, “The dung of mice.&quot; &quot;So be it,&quot; said Pilinda, and the pepper turned into dung. The man was horrified, and, seeking Pilinda, </data>
<data>persuaded him to right the matter (AA.i.154f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Vinaya Pitaka mentions that on several different occasions Pilinda suffered from various ailments and the Buddha had to give permission for the provision of suitable remedies. Vin.i.204f.; some hold (e.g., Brethren 14, n. 4) that the Thera of Rájagaha, mentioned in the following stories, was distinct from the Thera of Sávatthi. See below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once Bimbisára found Pilinda, clearing a cave in order to provide a cell for himself. The king promised to build a monastery for him if he could obtain the Buddha's sanction. The permission was obtained and was reported to the king, but he forgot the matter until one hundred days later. On remembering, he made ample amends, gave Pilinda five hundred attendants to look after the monastery, and granted for their maintenance a village, which came to be called Arámikagáma or Pilindagáma. One day, while in the village for alms, Pilinda went into a house where a girl was weeping because the day was a feast day and she had no ornament to wear, her parents being too poor to afford any. Pilinda gave her a roll of grass to put round her head and it turned instantly into solid gold. The king's officers, hearing of this wreath, suspected the family of theft and cast them into prison. The next day Pilinda, discovering what had happened, visited the king and convinced him of his iddhi powers by turning the whole palace into gold. The family was released, and the king and his courtiers gave to Pilinda large quantities of the five medicaments, all of which Pilinda distributed among those who wished for them. Vin.i.206 ff.; iii.248ff. This was the occasion for the forming of the rule that all medicaments required by a monk should be used within seven days. It was in reference to this that the Gandhára Játaka (J.iii.363 ff.) was preached. The </data>
<data>incident of the palace being turned into gold is referred to at Kvu.608.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another story is related of Pilinda's iddhi powers (Vin.iii.67). Once a family of Benares, which was wont to minister to Pilinda, was attacked by robbers and two girls were kidnapped. Pilinda, by his iddhi power caused them to be brought back, and the monks complained of this to the Buddha, but the Buddha held that no wrong had been done. The Apadána (i.59f.; 302 16) has two sets of verses ascribed to Pilinda, the second very much longer than the first, thus supporting the view mentioned earlier, that there were two Theras named Pilindavaccha. In any event, there has evidently been a confusion of legends, and it is no longer possible to separate them. It is the first set of Apadána verses which is quoted in the Theragáthá Commentary (Loc. cit.). In the second set we are told that in the time of Padumuttara Buddha, Pilinda was a very wealthy dovárika. He took many precious gifts to Ananda, Padumuttara's father, and won from him a boon. He asked, as his boon, that he should be allowed to entertain the Buddha. The king refused to grant this, but the dovárika appealed to the judges and they gave the verdict in his favour. Thereupon he held a great almsgiving of unparalleled splendour for seven days and gave away all manner of gifts. As a result he was born one thousand times as king of the devas and one thousand times also as king of men. In his last birth he suffered from neither heat nor cold, dust did not adhere to his body, and the rain did not wet him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

A discussion between him and the Buddha on trance and on the soul, which took place in Mallikáráma in Sávatthi, is reported in the Potthapáda Sutta. Potthapáda, accepting the Buddha's views, was jeered at by his companions for doing so. Two or three days later he again visited the Buddha with Citta Hatthisáriputta (q.v.), when the Buddha continued the earlier discussion on personality and the soul.

Wishing to rouse him to exert himself, the Buddha constantly referred to him as &quot;Tuccha-Pothila.&quot; Pothila took the hint, and, travelling one hundred and twenty leagues, arrived at a forest hermitage where lived thirty monks. He asked their leader to help him, but he referred him to a junior monk, who, in his turn, referred him on, and so on, until at last he was forced to apply to the seven year old novice who sat doing needlework. With his pride humbled, Pothila asked him for advice. In order to test him, the novice asked him to jump into a pool with his robes on. This Pothila did, and the novice, satisfied as to his earnestness taught him how, in the case of an anthill with six holes into which a lizard entered, anyone, wishing to capture the lizard, would close up five of the holes. So with the six doors of the senses; close five doors, and concentrate on the door of the mind. At the end of the discourse, the Buddha appeared before Pothila in a ray of light and Pothila became an arahant (DhA.iii.417-21). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two verses, addressed to him by Moggallána, are given in the Theragáthá (Vs. 1174-5).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

On his way home by sea he felt doubtful of one word, and returned all the way, one hundred leagues, to consult his teacher. On the way from the port he mentioned the word to a householder, who was so pleased with him that he gave him a blanket and one hundred thousand. This blanket Tissa gave to his teacher, but the latter cut it up and used it as a spread, as an example to others (not to desire luxuries). Tissa had his doubts set at rest and returned to Jambukola. There, at the Válíkáváma, as he was sweeping the courtyard of the cetiya, other monks asked him questions in order to vex him. But he was able to answer all these, having attained the patisambhidá.

It is said that when he visited Rájagaha after the holding of the First Council, he was asked to give his approval to the &quot;findings&quot; of the same. His answer was that he preferred to remember what he himself had heard and learnt from the Buddha. Vin.ii.189f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;2. Purána&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;A chamberlain (thapati ? equerry) of Pasenadi. He was the brother of Isidatta and the father of Migasálá. In his later years he lived the life of a celibate and was reborn in Tusita as a sakadágámí. A.iii.348 ff.;v.138 ff. The SA (iii.215), however, says that Purána was a sotápanna.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A conversation he had with the Buddha, in the company of Isidatta, at Sádhuka (q.v.), is recorded in the Samyutta Nikáya (S.v.349 ff). In the Dhammacetiya Sutta (M.ii.123) Pasenadi speaks of the great loyalty of these two men towards the Buddha. After discussing the Doctrine till late at night, they would sleep with their heads towards the spot where the Buddha was staying and their feet towards the king. Purána is mentioned (E.g., A.iii.451) as an ideal layman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

He left the world after a son had been born to him, and, having entered the Order under the Buddha, took the formula of the five impurities (tacapañcaka) as topic of meditation and became an arahant. His former wife adorned herself and came with her child, seeking to seduce him, but without success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Vipassí Buddha he was a partridge (cakkaváka), and, pleased with the appearance of the Buddha, offered him a sála flower, holding it in his beak.

He left the world after the birth of a son, and, dwelling near the village, put forth effort, till he became an arahant. Then going to Sávatthi, he paid homage to the Buddha and dwelt in a charnel field. Meanwhile his son died, and his wife, wishing to prevent the king from taking the property, which was now left without an heir, went, with a large company, to her husband in order to persuade him to return to the lay life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Tissa Buddha he was wandering about the forest, bow in hand, when he saw the Buddha's robe hanging on a branch outside his cell.

He was born in the Sirimáuyyána in Kási, his father being the khattiya Jayasena and his mother Sirimá. AA. (i. 144) says that his father was Mahinda and that he had three stepbrothers. One of them was Uruvela Kassapa (i. 165) in this birth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He lived for six thousand years in three palaces: Garula, Hamsa and Suvannabhara. His wife was Kiságotamí and his son Ananda (or Anúpama). His body was fifty eight cubits high. He left the world riding an elephant, and practised austerities for six months. A setthi's daughter, Sirivaddhá, gave him milk rice, while an ascetic, named Sirivaddha, gave him grass for his seat, under an ámanda (or ámalaka )tree. His chief disciples were Sukhita (or Surakkhita) and Dhammasena among men and Cálá (or Sálá) and Upacálá (Upasálá) among women. His personal attendant was Sambhiya. Dhanañjaya and Visákha among men, and Padumá and Nágá among women, were his chief lay patrons. The Bodhisatta was a khattiya named Vijitáví of Arimanda. The Buddha lived for ninety thousand years and died at the Sonáráma (Setáráma) in Kusinárá. His relies were scattered (Bu.xix.1ff.; BuA.192f.; PvA.19f). Ambapálí was his sister. Ap.ii. 613.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;2. Phussa Thera&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was the son of a ruler of a province and was trained in all accomplishments. Having heard a great Thera preach, he left the world and joined the Order. He practised jhána and became an arahant. One day an ascetic named Pandarassagotta heard him preach and questioned him on the future progress of Bhikkhus.

The Buddha tells him to avoid finding delight in the pleasures of the senses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On learning that Punna proposes to live in Sunáparanta, the Buddha warns him that the people of that part are fierce and violent. Punna declares that even should they kill him, he would not bear them ill will, but would rejoice to be of use to them. He leaves for Sunáparanta, with the Buddha's approval, and there gather around him five hundred disciples of either sex who have won arahantship. After Punna's death, the monks question the Buddha about him, and the Buddha tells them that he had realised nibbána. M.iii.267 ff.; S.iv.60 ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Sahampatí appears before him and confirms his intention. The Buddha thereupon goes to the Nigrodháráma, makes the monks come to him in ones and twos, and talks to them. The life of a recluse is the meanest of callings   to be called a &quot;scrap gatherer.&quot; It is entered on by householders solely as a means of escaping from woe. The man who leaves the world and who yet does not fulfil the life of a recluse, is like a faggot from a funeral pyre, burnt at both ends and smeared with filth. Therefore should the monks shun thoughts of lust, ill will and hurt, and practise the four satipatthánas. Thus will they obtain release. S.iii.91ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Jánussoni once met him returning from Jetavana, where he had gone early to wait on the Buddha. Pilotika, on being questioned, spoke very highly of the Buddha. It is this conversation which, on its being repeated by Jánussoni to the Buddha, led to the preaching of the Cullahatthipadopama Sutta (M.i.175 ff). Jánussoni addresses Pilotika as Vaccháyana, which, according to the Commentary, (MA.i.393) was the name of his clan. From the same source we gather that the Paribbájaka's own name was Pilotiká; he was young, of a golden colour, and loved ministering to the Buddha and the Buddha's eminent disciples. He is spoken of, together with Sabhiya (SA.ii.188), as a wise Paribbájaka. Pilotika is identified with Devinda of the Mahá Ummagga Játaka. J.vi.478.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;2.

But on noticing his rag and his potsherd, he realized his folly and, admonishing himself, returned to his meditation. Three times the same thing happened, but in the end he became an arahant.

Ambattha was the pupil of Pokkharasáti, who sent him to the Buddha at Icchánangala to discover if the report of the Buddha's greatness were true. When Pokkharasáti heard later that Ambattha had been rude to the Buddha, he sought the Buddha by night and begged for his forgiveness. The next day he invited the Buddha to a meal, and having listened to his teaching, declared himself his follower and became a sotápanna (D.i.87f., 106ff). Owing to his eminence, he was present at the meetings of the brahmins held in Manasákata (D.i.235) and Icchánangala (SN.p.115). Vasettha, of the Vásettha Sutta, was also his pupil (SN.vs.594). In the Subha Sutta (M.ii.200ff)*, Subha Todeyyaputta, another disciple, is reported to have said that Pokkharasáti - here described as Opamañña (of the Upamañña clan) and lord of Subhagavana (Subhapvanika)   treated as empty boasts the claims of brahmins and recluses to transcend ordinary human bonds and rise to the height of Ariyan knowledge. This evidently refers to a time prior to his conversion. The same Sutta mentions a slave girl of Pokkharasáti, Punniká by name.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;* the Vimánavatthu gives the name of another of his   disciples, Chattamánava (q.v.), who was killed while bringing presents to his   teacher. (Vv.v.3; VvA.229ff.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commentaries (DA.i.244f.; MA.ii.804; SNA.462) dwell at length on Pokkharasáti's attractive personality. His body was of the color of the white lotus, like a silver pandal in heaven, his hair the color of sapphire, his eyes like blue lotus, etc. He evidently was of true regal appearance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Kassapa Buddha he was a brahmin versed in </data>
<data>the three Vedas who, having heard the doctrine and given alms, was reborn in the deva world. Thereafter, scorning birth in the womb of a woman, he sprang to life in a lotus, which grew in a pond in Himáva. An ascetic saw the lotus, adopted the boy, and taught him the Vedas. The king was pleased with his great learning, and gave him Ukkatthá as a mark of great favor. The name of Pokkharasáti was given to him owing to his birth in a lotus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Divyávadána (p. 616 ff., 620) calls him Puskarasárí, and tells a story of his daughter Prakrti.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

In the time of Padumuttara Buddha he was an ascetic well versed in the Vedas who, seeing the Buddha, gave him a pundaríka fruit. One hundred and seven kappas ago he was a king named Sumangala (Ap.i.160f). He is probably identical with Susárada Thera. ThagA.i.167.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;3. Phaladáyaka Thera&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;An arahant. Also called Piyálaphaladáyaka. In the time of Sikhí Buddha he was a pigeon who gave to the Buddha a piyála fruit. Fifteen kappas ago he was a king called Málabhi (Ap.i.169f). He is probably identical with Devasabha. ThagA.i.187f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;4. Phaladáyaka Thera&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;An arahant. Ninety four kappas ago Siddhattha Buddha came to him for alms after having arisen from samádhi, and he gave the Buddha various fruits. Fifty seven kappas ago he was a king named Ekajjha. Ap.i.239.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;5. Phaladáyaka Thera&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;An arahant. In the time of Vipassí Buddha he was an ascetic living on the banks of the Bhágírathí and gave to the Buddha all the fruits he had gathered for his own meal.

He was a former birth of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/devadatta')"&gt;Devadatta&lt;/a&gt; (J.iii.161). His story is given in the&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/dhonasaakha_jat_353')"&gt;Dhonasákha Játaka&lt;/a&gt; (q.v.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;2.

At the time that he visited the Buddha with the other disciples he was 120 years old and very feeble. At the end of his discussion with the Buddha, as recorded in the Pingiya Sutta (SN. vs. 1120 23), because of his feebleness, he failed to reach any attainment. Thereupon he praised the Buddha and begged of him to go on. The Buddha preached to him further, and he became an anágámí, failing, however, to attain arahantship because his mind wandered to his maternal uncle, Bávarí. His one thousand pupils, however, became arahants. Later, with the Buddha's leave, he visited Bávarí and told him the glad tidings, describing the Buddha's glory (SN.vs.1131 45). At the end of his statement, the Buddha, seeing that the minds of both of them were mature, sent forth a ray of light from Sávatthi and, appearing before them, preached to them. Thereupon Bávarí became an anágámí and Pingiya an arahant (SNA.ii.603ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pingiya was called mánava, even at the age of 120. (SNA.ii.413).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;3. Pingiya&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the seven anágamíns born in the Avihá world, in the company of Ghatíkárá (S.i.35, 60). He is described as a bhikkhú, and is therefore probably identical with Pingiya (2). The story of the latter having attained arahantship must, in that case, have been a later legend.

One day, having gone to Benares for salt and vinegar, he entered the city for alms and went to the house of a merchant with a reputation for piety. But the merchant was away at the court, and as the ascetic saw no one in the house, he turned and went away. On the way he was met by the merchant, who apologised for his absence and invited him to return to his house.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told to a monk, who, on joining the Order, inquired who looked after the monks. On being told that Anáthapindika and Visakhá did so, he went to their houses very early the next day. It was so early that no one attended to him. When he returned later it was too late and the food had all gone. Thereupon he started abusing the two families. J.iii.118 ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Púrana Kassapa&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the six well known teachers, contemporaneous with the Buddha. He is said to have taught the doctrine of non-action (akiriya), denying the result of good or bad actions (D.i.52 f); probably the more correct description of Kassapa's teaching would be niskriyaváda - i.e., an affirmation that the soul is passive, unaffected by the good or the bad done by us, the ultimate reality lying beyond good or evil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere (S.iii.69; v.126), however, he is mentioned as an ahetuvádin, denying hetupaccaya (condition and cause -  i.e., the efficacy of kamma), which teaching, in the Sámmaññaphala Sutta (D.i.53; see also A.iii.383, where the teaching of Chalabhijátiyo is also attributed to Púrana), is attributed to Makkhali Gosála. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buddhaghosa says (DA.i.142; he could not have been a slave. Kassapa is a brahmin gotta. The SNA (372) calls him an ájívaka) that Púrana Kassapa came by his name from the fact that as a result of his birth the number of slaves in a certain household reached one hundred. Owing to this fact he was never found fault with, even when he failed to do his work satisfactorily. But, in spite of this, he was dissatisfied and fled from his masters. He then had his clothes stolen by thieves and went about naked. His gotta name was Kassapa. He had a following of five hundred, among whom was the deva putta Asama (S.i.65, see also Ajátasattu). He was consulted by the Licchavis Abhaya (S.v.126) and Maháli (S.iii.68) and by the wanderer Vacchagotta (S.iv.398). He claimed to be omniscient. (A.iv.428; here we probably have a more correct explanation of his name, Púrana   i.e., in his claim to have attained perfect wisdom, púranañánna). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A story in the Dhammapada Commentary (DhA.iii.208)* states that when the heretics were unable to prevent the Buddha from performing the </data>
<data>Twin Miracle under the Gandamba, they fled discomfited. Púrana Kassapa was among them, and in the course of his flight, he came across one of his followers, a farmer, who was on his way to see him, carrying a vessel of broth and a rope. Púrana took the vessel and the rope, and going to the banks of the river near Sávatthi, tied the vessel round his neck and threw himself into the stream. There was a circle of bubbles on the water and Púrana was reborn in Avíci. The Milindapañha (p. 4 f) also mentions a Púrana Kassapa, contemporary with Milinda. This perhaps refers to a teacher descended from the same school who is credited with the view that the earth rules or sustains the world. v.l. Purána.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* For a different version see Rockhill: op. cit., 80. According to this legend, Kassapa must have died in the sixteenth year of the Buddha's ministry. This is hardly reconcilable with the statement that Ajátasattu consulted him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Pukkusáti was already occupying the guest room of the house, and the Buddha asked to be allowed to share it, to which Pukkusáti readily agreed. They sat together for sometime in silence, and then the Buddha preached the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/dhaatuvibhanga')"&gt;Dhátuvibhanga Sutta&lt;/a&gt;. Pukkusáti recognised the Buddha at the end of the sermon and begged his forgiveness for not having paid him due honour; he then begged to have the upasampadá conferred on him. The Buddha consented and sent him to procure a begging bowl and a robe. On the way Pukkusáti was gored to death by a mad cow. When this was reported to the Buddha, he said that Pukkusáti was an &lt;a href="http://www.palikanon.com/english/wtb/a/anagami')"&gt;Anágámin&lt;/a&gt; and had been born in the realms above, never more to return. M.iii.237 47. In this context Pukkusáti is spoken of as a kulaputta (iii.238); see also J.iv.180 and DhA.ii.35.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his comments on the Dhátuvibhanga Sutta, Buddhaghosa gives a long account of Pukkusáti. MA.ii.979 ff. Cp. the story of Tissa, king of Roruva (ThagA.i.199f.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He had been the king of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/t/takkasilaa')"&gt;Takkasilá&lt;/a&gt;, contemporary of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bimbisara')"&gt;Bimbisára&lt;/a&gt; and of about the same age. A friendly alliance was established between the two kings through the medium of merchants who travelled between the two countries for purposes of trade. In the course of time, although the two kings had never seen each other, there grew up between them a deep bond of affection. Pukkusáti once sent to Bimbisára, as a gift, eight priceless garments in </data>
<data>lacquered caskets. This gift was accepted at a special meeting of the whole court, and Bimbisára having nothing of a material nature, which he considered precious enough to send to Pukkusáti, conceived the idea of acquainting Pukkusáti with the appearance in the world of the Three Jewels (ratanáni) the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. He had inscribed on a golden plate, four cubits long and a span in breadth, descriptions of these Three Jewels and of various tenets of the Buddha's teachings, such as the satipattháná, the Noble Eightfold Path, and the Thirty seven factors of Enlightenment. This plate was placed in the innermost of several caskets of various precious substances, and was taken in procession on the back of the state elephant up to the frontier of Bimbisira's kingdom. Similar honours were paid to it by the chiefs of other territories, through which lay the route to Takkasilá.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Pukkusáti, in the solitude of his chamber, read the inscription on the plate, he was filled with boundless joy and decided to renounce the world. He cut off his hair, donned the yellow robes of a monk, and left the palace alone amid the lamentations of his subjects. He travelled the one hundred and ninety two leagues to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/saavatthi')"&gt;Sávatthi&lt;/a&gt;, passing the gates of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/j/jetavana')"&gt;Jetavana&lt;/a&gt;; but having understood from Bimbisára's letter that the Buddha was at Rájagaha, he omitted to enquire for him at Jetavana, and travelled on forty five leagues more to Rájagaha, only to find that the Buddha was all the time in Sávatthi. As it was then evening, he took lodging in Bhaggava's house. The Buddha, with his divine eye, saw what was in store for Pukkusáti, and travelling on foot from Sávatthi, reached Bhaggava's house at sundown, and, waiting his opportunity, engaged Pukkusáti in talk and preached to </data>
<data>him the Dhátuvibhanga Sutta, as related above. After his untimely death* Pukkusáti was born in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/avihaa')"&gt;Avihá&lt;/a&gt; world, where, together with six others, he became an arahant at the moment of his birth (see S.i.35, 60, for the names of the others.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;*The cow that killed Pukkusáti is said to have been a   Yakkhiní who was a cow in one hundred births. In her last birth as a cow, she   killed, in addition to Pukkusáti, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/baahiya')"&gt;Báhiya Dáruciriya&lt;/a&gt;,   &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/t/tambadaathika')"&gt;Tambadáthika&lt;/a&gt;, and   &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/suppabuddha')"&gt;Suppabuddha&lt;/a&gt; the leper (DhA.ii.35).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pukkhusáti was one of seven monks who, in the time of Kassapa Buddha, decided to abstain from eating until they should attain arahantship. They lived on the top of a mountain. The senior monk attained arahantship, the second became an anágámí, but the remaining five died of starvation and were reborn in Tusita. In this age they became, respectively, Pukkusáti, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kumaara_kassapa')"&gt;Kumára Kassapa&lt;/a&gt;, Dárucíriya, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/dabba_mallaputta_th')"&gt;Dabba Mallaputta&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sabhiya')"&gt;Sabhiya&lt;/a&gt;.

Once, having gone to the vihára with other boys, he saw a conch shell offered at the bodhi tree and blew on it. All those who heard him stood as if stunned, and he came to be called Ummáda Phussadeva. His father was an archer, and he himself became very skilled in this art (Mhv.xxiii.82f), the best archer in the island (Mhv.xxv.82). In Dutthagámaní's fight with Bhalluka, Phussadeva sat behind the king on the elephant and shot Bhalluka. His arrow grazed the king's ear, causing the blood to flow. In expiation, Phussadeva cut off the lobe of his own ear and showed it to the king. Later the king planted Phussadeva's arrow on the floor, and covering it to its full height with kahápanas, gave the money to Phussadeva.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Pubbaseliyá&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the seventeen heterodox sects which arose in Jambudípa in the second century after the Buddha's death (Mhv.v.12; Dpv.v.55).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Kathávatthu Commentary (see Points of Controversy xli.104, 108, 115) they belonged to the Andhaka school. Their views seem to have been similar to those of the Cetiyavádins (J.R.A.S. 1910, p. 413 ff). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Tibetan sources (Rockhill: op. cit., 184) they were so called because they lived on the Púrva Mountain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Pingiyání&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;1. Pingiyání&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;A brahmin of Vesáli. The Anguttara Nikáya records a conversation between him and Káranapáli. The latter meets Pingiyání and, on learning that he was returning from a visit to the Buddha, asks him about the Buddha's wisdom. Pingiyáni utters the Buddha's praises with a wealth of simile and metaphor. Káranapáli is impressed, and declares himself the Buddha's follower (A.iii.236ff). On another occasion, Pingiyáni is present when five hundred Licchavis come to pay honour to the Buddha at the Kútágárasálá. The sight of the Buddha, sitting in their midst, outshining them all, inspires Pingiyáni and he bursts into song. The Licchavis give him five hundred upper garments, all of which he presents to the Buddha. Ibid., 239f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buddhaghosa says (AA.ii.636) that Pingiyání was an anágámí. He went daily to the Buddha, with flowers and perfumes. See also &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pu/pingiya')"&gt;Pingiya&lt;/a&gt; (3).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;2. Pingiyání&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wife of Brahmadatta. One day when opening her window she saw a royal groom, with whom she fell in love, and when the king fell asleep, she climbed down through the window, lay with the groom, and climbed back again, after which she perfumed herself and lay down beside the king. The king eventually discovered her misdemeanour and proclaimed it to his ministers, depriving her of her royal rank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story is one of those related by Kunála, who is identified with &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/brahmadatta')"&gt;Brahmadatta&lt;/a&gt; (J.v.444). It is perhaps this story which is referred to as the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/culla_kunaala_jat_464')"&gt;Culla Kunála Játaka&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Pingiyání Sutta&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story of the brahmin Pingiyání (q.v.) uttering the </data>
<data>Buddha's praises before the Licchavis. When Pingiyání ended his song of praise, the Buddha told the Licchavis of the five kinds of rare treasures: the Tathágata, one who can teach the Dhammavinaya, one who recognises the Dhamma, one who follows the Dhamma, and one who is grateful.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Pubbakotthaká&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A bathing place in Sávatthi, near the Migáramátupásáda, and therefore to the east of the city. Mention is made (A.iii.345) of the Buddha having bathed there. It was evidently extensive, for Pasenadi's state elephant Seta also bathed there to the accompaniment of music. The Commentary calls it (AA.ii.668) a nadí. The bathing place was probably near the Pubbakotthaka (? Eastern Gatehouse) of Sávatthi, where the Buddha is said to have stayed. S.v.220; the bathing place seems also to have been called Pubbakotthaka. Near by was the hermitage of the brahmin Rammaka (M.i.161). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public bathing places were generally near the city gates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman"&gt;Details of this are given at MA.i.370f. There were four bathing places: for the king, for the people, for the Buddha, and the Sangha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

A name for the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/g/gangaa')"&gt;Ganges&lt;/a&gt; (E.g.,   J.v.93, 255; Ap.ii.436). The river was so called because the sage Bhagíratha   filled up the ocean with the Ganges whom he made his daughter (Mahábhárata,   iii. 107, 9961; v.178, 7096). It may also be the name of a separate river   flowing from the Himálaya and forming one of the chief sources of the Ganges.   The river flowed past Hamsavatí (E.g., Ap.i.51; ii.343). v.l. Bhagírasí,   Bhagírathí.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Bhúridatta Játaka (No.543)&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prince Brahmadatta, son of the king of Benares, lived on the banks of the Yamuná, exiled from his father's kingdom. He wore the garb of an ascetic, but his heart was not in the ascetic life, and, when a Nága maiden tried to seduce him, he easily succumbed. Their children were Ságara Brahmadatta and Samuddajá. When the king of Benares died, Brahmadatta returned with his children to the kingdom and his Nága wife returned to the Nága world. While playing about in a lake specially prepared for them, the children of Brahmadatta discovered a tortoise, Cittacúla, and were much frightened. Cittacúla was brought before the king and was ordered to be cast into the Yamuná, that being the direst penalty the king could envisage. Caught in a whirlpool, Cittacúla was carried to the realm of the Nágaking Dhatarattha, and, when questioned, had the presence of mind to say that he had been sent from Benares to propose a marriage between Dhatarattha and Samuddajá. Nága messengers were sent to the Benares court to make arrangements, and they laid their proposal before the king. Cittacúla had meanwhile spirited himself away. Brahmadatta was horrified at the proposals of the messengers, and did not fail to say so, whereupon Dhatarattha was so incensed at the insult offered to him that he laid siege to Benares with his Nága hosts. To avert the total destruction of the city, Samuddajá was given to Dhatarattha, with whom she dwelt for a long time without discovering that she was in the Nága world, everyone, at the king's orders, having assumed human form. Samuddajá had four children   Sudassana, Datta, Subhaga and Arittha (Kánárittha) -  and one step daughter, Accimukhí. Datta, who was the Bodhisatta, used to visit Virúpakkha, the ruler of the Nága hosts, and one day went with him to pay homage to Sakka. In the </data>
<data>assembly a question arose which only Datta could answer, and Sakka was so pleased with him that he gave him the name of Bhúridatta (wise Datta). Anxious to be born in Sakka's company, Bhúridatta took the vows and observed the fast, lying on the top of an ant hill. At the end of the fast, Nága maidens would come and take him back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One day a brahmin villager and his son, Somadatta, went hunting in the forest and spent the night on a banyan tree near where Bhúridatta lay. At dawn, these two saw the Nága maidens come for Bhúridatta and witnessed their song and dance, which Bhúridatta, having laid aside his snake form, much enjoyed. Discovering the presence of the villagers, Bhúridatta entered into conversation with them, and invited them to the Nága world, where they passed a whole year, enjoying great luxury. Owing to lack of merit, the villagers grew discontented and wished to return to the world of men on the pretext that they wished to become ascetics. Bhúridatta offered them a wish conferring jewel, but this they refused, saying that they had no use for it. Once in the world of men, Somadatta and his father took off their ornaments to bathe, but these divine ornaments disappeared to the Nága world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some time later, while father and son were wandering about in the forest, having returned from stalking deer, they met a brahmin called &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/aa/aalambaayana')"&gt;Alambáyana&lt;/a&gt;, who possessed a Nága jewel. He was a poor man of Benares who had fled into the forest to escape his creditors. There he had met an ascetic, Kosiya, to whom a Garuda king had taught the Álambáyana spell which was potent to tame Nágas. The Garuda had torn up a banyan tree, which shaded the ascetic's walk. A Nága, which the Garuda had seized, coiled itself round the tree, but the Garuda carried the tree with the Nága on it. When he discovered that he had done </data>
<data>the ascetic an injury in pulling up the tree, he felt repentant and taught the ascetic the Álambáyana spell by way of atonement. The ascetic, in turn, taught it to the poor brahmin, hoping it would help him. The brahmin, now called Álambáyana, left the ascetic and, while wandering about, came across some Nágas, carrying Bhúridatta's jewel. They heard him recite the spell and fled in terror, leaving behind them the jewel, which he picked up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Somadatta and his father met the brahmin, they saw the jewel, and the father schemed to steal it. He told Álambáyana of the difficulties connected with guarding the jewel and of how dangerous it might prove, if not duly honoured. If Álambáyana would give him the jewel, he would show him the abode of Bhúridatta, whom the brahmin might then capture, making money with his help. When Somadatta realized his father's treachery, he rebuked him and fled from him. Álambáyana went with the villager and captured Bhúridatta and crushed his bones. Having thus rendered the Nága helpless. Álambáyana put him in a basket and travelled about making him dance before large audiences The jewel, which Álambáyana gave to the treacherous villager, slipped from the later's hand and returned to the Nága world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the day of the capture of Bhúridatta, his mother had a terrifying dream, and later, when Bhúridatta had been absent for a month, she grew very anxious and lamented piteously. A search was instituted - Kánárittha was sent to the deva world, Subhaga to Himavá, Sudassana and Accimukhí to the world of men. Sudassana went disguised as an ascetic, and Accimukhí, assuming the form of a frog, hid in his matted hair. They found Álambáyana making ready to give an exhibition of Bhúridatta's dancing before the king of Benares. Sudassana took up his stand at the edge of the crowd, and Bhúridatta, seeing </data>
<data>him, went up to him. The crowd retreated in fear. When Bhúridatta was back in his basket, Sudassana challenged Álambáyana to prove that his magic powers were greater than those of Sudassana. This challenge was accepted, and Sudassana called out to Accimukhí who, uttering the frog's cry, stood on his shoulder, and having spat drops of poison on to his palm, went back into his hair. Saying that the country would be destroyed if the poison fell on the earth, Sudassana had three holes dug, and filled the first with drugs, the second with cow dung, and the third with heavenly medicines. He poured the poison into the first hole; a flame instantly burst out, spread to the second, and, having travelled on to the third, consumed all the medicines and was extinguished. Álambáyana was standing near the last hole: the heat of the poison smote him, the colour of his skin changed, and he became a leper. Filled with terror, he set the Nága free. Bhúridatta assumed a radiant form decked with all ornaments; so did Sudassana and Accimukhí. The king, on discovering that they were the children of Samuddajá, rejoiced greatly and entertained them. Bhúridatta returned to the Nága world, the king accompanying him. The king stayed there for some days and then returned to his kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Subhaga, in the course of his wanderings, came across Somadatta's father, and, on discovering that it was he who had betrayed Bhúridatta, snatched him away into the Nága world, after first nearly drowning him in the whirlpools of the Yamuná. Kánárittha, who was guarding the entrance to the room where Bhúridatta lay ill and tired after his experiences, protested against Subhaga's ill treatment of a brahmin, and described the greatness of the brahmins and the importance of holding sacrifices and of learning the Vedas. The Nágas, who were listening, were greatly impressed, and Bhúridatta, seeing them </data>
<data>in danger of accepting false doctrine, sent for Kánárittha, confuted his arguments, and converted the Nágas to the right view. Some time after, Bhúridatta, with his retinue, and followed by Dhatarattha, Samuddajá, and their other children, visited his grandfather Brahmadatta, who had become an ascetic. There they met Ságara Brahmadatta, now king of Benares, and great was the rejoicing over their reunion. Samuddajá then returned with her family to the Nága world, where they lived happily to the end of their days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related in reference to some laymen of Sávatthi who kept the fast diligently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Devadatta is identified with Álambáyana, Ananda with Somadatta, Uppalavanná with Accimukhí, Sáriputta with Sudassana, Moggallána with Subhaga, and Sunakkhatta with Kánárittha (J.vi.157 219).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story of Bhúridatta is found also in the Cariyápitaka (Cyp.ii.2) as the Bhúridatta cariyá, to illustrate Sílapáramitá. In the fifteenth century Ratthasára, a monk of Ava, wrote a metrical version of the Bhúridatta Játaka.  Sás.99.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Bimbisára&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;King of Magadha and patron of the Buddha. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He ascended the throne at the age of fifteen and reigned in Rájagaha for fifty two years. The Buddha was five years older than Bimbisára, and it was not until fifteen years after his accession that Bimbisára heard the Buddha preach and was converted by him. It is said (Mhv.ii.25ff.; Dpv.iii.50ff ) that the two were friends in their youth owing to the friendship which existed between their fathers. Bimbisára's father was called Bháti (MT.137; Dpv.iii.52); according to Tibetan sources (Rockhill, op. cit., 16) he was called Mahápaduma and his Mother Bimbí.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But according to the Pabbajá Sutta (SN.vs.405ff.; also J.i.66 and DhA.i.85; also Rockhill, p. 27) the first meeting between the Buddha and Bimbisára took place in Rájagaha under the Pandavapabbata, only after the Buddha's Renunciation. The king, seeing the young ascetic pass below the palace windows, sent messengers after him. On learning, that he was resting after his meal, Bimbisára followed him and offered him a place in his court. This the Buddha refused, revealing his identity. The Commentary adds (SNA.ii.386) that Bimbisára wished him success in his quest and asked him to visit first Rájagaha as soon as he had attained Enlightenment. It was in fulfilment of this promise that the Buddha visited Rájagaha immediately after his conversion of the Tebhátika Jatilá. He stayed at the Supatittha cetiya in Latthivanuyyána, whither Bimbisára, accompanied by twelve nahutas of householders, went to pay to him his respects. The Buddha preached to them, and eleven nahutas, with Bimbisára at their head, became sotápannas. On the following day the Buddha and hiss large retinue of monks accepted the hospitality of Bimbisára. Sakka, in the guise of a </data>
<data>young man, preceded them to the palace, singing songs of glory of the Buddha. At the conclusion of the meal, Bimbisára poured water from a golden jar on the Buddha's hand and dedicated Veluvana for the use of him and of his monks (Vin.i.35ff). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was this gift of Veluvana, which formed the model for Devánampiyatissa's gift of the Mahámeghavana to Mahinda (Mhv.xv.17). The gift of Veluvana was one of the incidents sculptured in the Relic chamber of the Mahá Thúpa (Mhv.xxx.80). It may have been in Veluvana that the king built for the monks a storeyed house, fully plastered (Vin.ii.154). With the attainment of sopátatti, the king declared that all the five ambitions of his life had been fulfilled: that he might become king, that the Buddha might visit his realm, that he might wait on the Buddha, that the Buddha might teach him the doctrine, that he might understand it (Vin.i.36). According to BuA. (p. 18f.) the king became a Sotápanna after listening to the Mahá-Nárada Játaka.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From this moment up till the time of his death, a period of thirty seven years, Bimbisára did all in his power to help on the new religion and to further its growth. He set an example to his subjects in the practice of the precepts by taking the uposatha vows on six days, of each month (PvA.209).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bimbisára's chief queen was Kosaladeví (q.v.), daughter of Mahákosala and sister of Pasenadi. On the day of her marriage she received, as part of her dowry, a village in Kási, for her bath money. Her son was Ajátasattu (also J.iii.121). Bimbisára had other wives as well; Khemá, who, at first, would not even visit the Buddha till enticed by Bimbisára's descriptions of the beauties of Veluvana; and the courtesan Padumavatí, who was brought from Ujjení, with the help of a Yakkha, so that Rájagaha might not lack a Nagarasobhiní. Both </data>
<data>these later became nuns. Padumavatí's son was Abhaya. Bimbisára had another son by Ambapálí, known as Vimala Kondañña, and two others, by different wives, known as Sílava and Jayasena. A daughter, Cundi, is also mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bimbisára's death, according to the Commentaries, was a sad one (E.g., DA.i.135 ff.; see also Vin.ii.190f). Soothsayers had predicted, before the birth of Ajátasattu, that he would bring about the death of his father, for which reason his mother had wished to bring about an abortion. But Bimbisára would not hear of this, and when the boy was born, treated him with the greatest affection (for details see Ajátasattu). When the prince came of age, Devadatta, by an exhibition of his iddhi-power, won him over to his side and persuaded him to encompass the death of his father, Bimbisára's patronage of the Buddha being the greatest obstacle in the path of Devadatta. The plot was discovered, and Bimbisára's ministers advised him to kill Ajátasattu, Devadatta and their associates. But Bimbisára sent for Ajátasattu and, on hearing that he desired power, abdicated in his favour. Devadatta chided Ajátasattu for a fool. &quot;You are like a man who puts a skin over a drum in which is a rat,&quot; and he urged on Ajátasattu the need for the destruction of Bimbisára.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But no weapon could injure Bimbisára (probably because he was a Sotápanna, he also had the power of judging the status of anyone by his voice – e.g., in the case of Kumbhaghosa, DhA.i.233), it was therefore decided that he should be starved to death, and with this end in view he was imprisoned in a hot house (tápanageha) with orders that none but the mother of Ajátasattu should visit him. On her visits she took with her a golden vessel filled with food which she concealed in her clothes. When this was discovered she took food in her head dress (molí), and, later, she was obliged to take what food she </data>
<data>could conceal in her footgear. But all these ways were discovered, and then the queen visited Bimbisára after having bathed in scented water and smeared her person with catumadhura (the four kinds of sweets). The king licked her person and that was his only sustenance. In the end the visits of the queen were forbidden; but the king continued to live by walking about his cell meditating. Ajátasattu, hearing of this, sent barbers to cut open his feet, fill the wounds with salt and vinegar, and burn them with coals. It is said that when the barbers appeared Bimbisára thought his son had relented and had sent them to shave him and cut his hair. But on learning their real purpose, he showed not the least resentment and let them do their work, much against their will. (In a previous birth he had walked about in the courtyard of a cetiya with shoes on, hence this punishment!) Soon after, Bimbisára died, and was reborn in the Cátummahárájika world as a Yakkha named Janavasabbha, in the retinue of Vessavana. The Janavasabha Sutta records an account of a visit paid by Janavasabha to the Buddha some time after.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A son was born to Ajátasattu on the day of Bimbisára's death. The joy be experienced at the birth of his son made him realize something of the affection his own father must have felt for him, and he questioned his mother. She told him stories of his childhood, and he repented, rather belatedly, of his folly and cruelty. Soon after, his mother died of grief, and her death gave rise to the protracted war between Ajátasattu and Pasenadi, as mentioned elsewhere (J.ii.237, 403).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The books contain no mention of any special sermons preached by the Buddha to Bimbisára nor of any questions asked by him of the Buddha.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When he heard that the Buddha intended to perform a miracle, although he had ordered his disciples to refrain from doing so, </data>
<data>Bimbisára had doubts about the propriety of this and questioned the Buddha who set his doubts at rest (DhA.iii.204; J.iii.263f.). It was also at the request of Bimbisára that the Buddha established the custom of the monks assembling on the first, eighth, fourteenth and fifteenth days of each month (Vin.i.101f.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps, like Anáthapindika, his equal in devotion to the Buddha, he refrained from giving the Buddha extra trouble, or perhaps the affairs of his kingdom, which was three hundred leagues in extent, did not permit him enough leisure for frequent visits to the Buddha. (DhA.iii.205; the kingdom included eighty thousand villages, gáma, Vin.i.179).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is said that he once visited four monks -  Godhika, Subáhu, Valliya and Uttiya -  and invited them to spend the rainy season at Rájagaha. He built for them four huts, but forgot to have them roofed, with the result that the gods withheld the rains until the king remembered the omission (ThagA.i.125). He similarly forgot his promise to give Pilindavaccha a park keeper, if the Buddha would sanction such a gift. Five hundred days later he remembered his promise and to make amends, gave five hundred park keepers with a special village for their residence, called Árámikagáma or Pilindagáma (Vin.i.207f.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bimbisára's affection for the Buddha was unbounded. When the Licchavis sent Maháli, who was a member of Bimbisára's retinue, to beg the Buddha to visit Vesáli, Bimbisára did not himself try to persuade the Buddha to do so, but when the Buddha agreed to go he repaired the whole road from Rájagaha to the Ganges -  a distance of five leagues - for the Buddha to walk upon; he erected a rest house at the end of each league, and spread flowers of five different colours knee deep along the whole way. Two parasols were provided for the Buddha and one for each monk. The king himself </data>
<data>accompanied the Buddha in order to look after him, offering him flowers and perfume and all requisites throughout the journey, which lasted five days. Arrived at the river, he fastened two boats together decked with flowers and jewels and followed the Buddha's boat into the water up to his neck. When the Buddha had gone, the king set up an encampment on the river bank, awaiting his return; he then escorted him back to Rájagaha with similar pomp and ceremony (DhA.iii.438 ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Great cordiality existed between Bimbisára and Pasenadi. They were connected by marriage, each having married a sister of the other. Pasenadi once visited Bimbisára in order to obtain from him a person of unbounded wealth (amitabhoga) for his kingdom. Bimbisára had five such -  Jotiya, Jatila, Mendaka, Punnaka and Kákavaliya; but Pasenadi had none. The request was granted, and Mendaka's son, Dhanañjaya, was sent back to Kosala with Pasenadi (DhA.i.385f.; AA.i.220). Some of these were richer than Bimbisára-  e.g., Jotiya (q.v.), whose house was built entirely of jewels while the king's palace was of wood; but the king showed no jealousy (DhA.iv.211).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bimbisára also maintained friendly relations with other kings, such as Pukkasáti, king of Takkasilá, Candappajjota, king of Ujjení, to whom he sent his own physician Jívaka to tend in his illness -  and Rudráyana of Roruka (Dvy.545).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the ministers and personal retinue of Bimbisára are mentioned Sona-Kolvisa, the flower gatherer Sumana who supplied the king with eight measures of jasmine flowers, the minister Koliya, the treasurer Kumbbaghosaka and his physician Jívaka. The last named was discovered for him by the prince Abhaya when he was suffering from a fistula. The king's garments were stained with blood and his queens mocked him. Jívaka cured the king with one single anointing; the king offered him the ornaments of </data>
<data>the five hundred women of the palace, and when he refused to take these, he was appointed physician to the king, the women of the seraglio and the fraternity of monks under the Buddha (Vin.i.272f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Dhammadinná wished to leave the world, Bimbisára gave her, at her husband's request, a golden palanquin and allowed her to go round the city in procession (MA.i.516).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bimbisára is generally referred to as Seniya Bimbisára. The Commentaries explain Seniya as meaning &quot;possessed of a large following&quot; or as &quot;belonging to the Seniyagotta,&quot; and Bimbisára as meaning &quot;of a golden colour,&quot; bimbí meaning gold (e.g., UdA.104). According to Tibetan sources, Bimbí was the name of his mother, and from this his own name was derived; but another reason was that he was radiant like the morning sun (Rockhill 16,  See also MA.i.292).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Phussa Buddha, when the Buddha's three step brothers, sons of King Jayasena, obtained their father's leave to entertain the Buddha for three months, Bimbisára, then head of a certain district, looked after all the arrangements. His associates in this task were born as petas, and he gave alms to the Buddha in their name in order to relieve their sufferings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;See Tirokudda Sutta, also PvA.21ff.; for his intercession on behalf of another pets. see PvA.89.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During his lifetime, Bimbisára was considered the happiest of men, but the Buddha declared (e.g., M.i.95) that he himself was far happier than the king.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The kahápana in use in Rájagaha during Bimbisára's time was the standard of money adopted by the Buddha in the formation of those rules into which the matter of money entered (Sp.ii.297).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bimbisára had a white banner and one of his epithets was Pandaraketu (Thag.vs.64; ThagA.i.147). Nothing is said about his future destiny, </data>
<data>but he is represented in the Janavasabha Sutta (D.ii.206) as expressing the wish to become a Sakadágámí, and this wish may have been fulfilled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Vijaya lived there for three months before sailing for Ceylon. Dpv.ix.26; the Dvy. (586) says the city was founded by Bhiru, one of the three people who escaped from the kingdom of Sikhandi, the parricide ruler of Sauvíra, when this was destroyed by a heavy fall of sand, following on the murder of Rudráyana, king of Roruka. Bharukaccha is, according to this account, a corruption of Bhírukaccha (Marsh of Bhiru). But Brahmanized tradition ascribes its foundation to the sage Bhrgu. It is identical with Barygaza of Ptolemy and the Periplus of the Erythrean Sea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bharukaccha is the modern Broach in Kathiawar. The people of Bharukaccha are called Bharukacchaká.

His wife died and, because of her love of money, was reborn as a mouse dwelling over the family treasure. In due course the rest of the family died and the village was deserted. The Bodhisiatta was a stone cutter, working a quarry near the mouse's residence. She, liking him, brought him one day a coin, suggesting that, with a part of it, he should buy her some meat. The Bodhisatta agreed, and this continued for some time. One day the mouse was caught by a cat, but she obtained her release by promising him some of her food. She was later caught by three other cats, but was let free on the same terms. The mouse thus had only one fifth of her food and grew very thin. The Bodhisiatta noticed this, and when she told him the reason, he put her inside a crystal box and suggested that when the cats came she should refuse to have anything to do with them. The first cat arrived and, on being reviled by the mouse, jumped on the crystal box and was crushed to death. The same fate overtook the other cats. The mouse thus became free, and in gratitude to the Bodhisatta, showed him all the treasure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to &lt;b&gt;Káná&lt;/b&gt; (q.v.), who lost her husband owing to four monks. The monks were the cats and Káná the mouse. J.i.477 80.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

D.ii.92.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Bhadda Thera.&lt;/b&gt; He was born in the family of a setthi of Sávatthi. His parents had gone to the Buddha before his conception, and had told him that if they had a child they would give him to the Buddha as his servant. When he was seven years old, they took him, arrayed in his best, to the Buddha, in fulfilment of their promise. The Buddha asked Ananda to ordain him. This he did and instructed him, and the same night Bhadda became an arahant. The Buddha called to him saying, &quot;Come, Bhadda,&quot; and that was his upasampadá.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Padumuttara Buddha he had offered hundreds of thousands of robes, etc., to the Buddha and his monks.

He had one hundred sons - the eldest being Sumana -  ninety nine of whom were killed by Asoka (Mhv.v.18 f., 38f.; Dpv.v.101; vi.15; some accounts, e.g., MT.324, say he had one hundred and one sons). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bindusára patronised the brahmins and provided constant meals for sixty thousand brahmins of various sects (Sp.i.44). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His mother was Candagutta's maternal cousin and chief queen. One day, while Bindusára was yet unborn, she was eating with Candagutta and he fed her with some food prepared for himself. The food contained poison, placed there by the orders of Candagutta's minister, Cánakka, that the king might gradually be made immune from poison. Cánakka entered as she was about to swallow the food, and, anxious to save the unborn child, he cut off the queen's head with a sword before the food could travel down into her stomach, opened her womb, removed the child, and placed it in the womb of a freshly slaughtered goat. For seven days the child lay in the womb of a goat, each day a fresh one, until, at the end of these seven days, the child was ready for birth. Because of this, Bindusára's body was spotted in various places from the blood of the goats, and from this he obtained his name (MT.187f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bindusára's chief queen was &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/dhammaa')"&gt;Dhammá&lt;/a&gt; of the Moriya clan. She bore two sons, Asoka and Tissa (MT.189, 324). Bindusára had to kill the Yakkha Devagabbha (q.v.) before he could ascend the throne (MT.188).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

He was given every kind of luxury and was shown all honour. All the king's around coveted the kingdom of Benares, and seven kings encompassed the city. At the suggestion of his ministers, the king sent out a knight on the royal destrier. Mounted on the noble steed, the knight destroyed six camps, when his horse was wounded. He thereupon took it to the gate, loosened its armour, and prepared to arm another horse. But the animal, knowing that no other horse could accomplish what awaited him, insisted on attacking the seventh camp. Then when they brought him back to the king's gate, the king came out to look upon him, and the horse died with a counsel for mercy towards the captive kings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to a monk who had given up persevering.

One day they came to the city of Bharu for salt and vinegar, and took up their residence under a banyan-tree to the north of the city. A similar group remained under a tree to the south. Next year, the tree to the south of the city was found to have withered away, and the group who had lived there, having arrived first, took possession of the other tree, to the north. This led to a dispute between the two groups, and they sought the intervention of Bharu, king of the Bharu country. He decided in favour of one group, but being bribed by the other, he changed his mind. Later, the ascetics repented of their greed and hastened back to Himavá. The gods, angry with the king, submerged the whole of Bharu, three hundred leagues in extent, under the sea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told to Pasenadi, king of Kosala, who took bribes from some heretics and gave permission for them to build a centre near Jetavana. When the Buddha heard of it, he sent monks to interview the king, but the latter refused to receive even the Chief Disciples. The Buddha then went himself and dissuaded the king from giving permission for an act which would lead to endless dissensions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;J.ii.169ff.; the story is also given at SA.iii.218 f., which says further that Pasenadi built the Rájakáráma to make amends for his fault.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

He was called Mahá Kañcana and had six younger brothers (the eldest of them being Upakañcana) and a sister, Kañcanadevi. None of them would marry, and, on the death of their parents, they distributed their wealth, and, together with a servant man and maid, they went into the Himálaya and became ascetics, gathering wild fruits for food. Later, they agreed that Mahá Kañcana, Kañcanadevi and the maid should be spared the task of collecting fruit and that the others should do this in turn. Each day the fruits collected were divided into lots and the gong was sounded. The ascetics would then come one by one and take each his or her share. By the glory of their virtues, Sakka's throne trembled. In order to test them, for three days in succession he caused Mahá Kañcana's share to disappear. On the third day, Mahá Kañcana summoned the others and asked the reason for this. Each protested his innocence and swore an oath that heavy curses should attend them if any were guilty of stealing so much as a lotus stalk (bhisa). In each case punishment was to be that in their next birth they should have lands, possessions and other encumbrances - which, from an ascetic's point of view, would be a grievous thing. At this gathering were also present the chief deity of the forest, an elephant escaped from a stake, a monkey who had once belonged to a snake charmer, and Sakka, who remained invisible. At the end of their protestations of innocence, Sakka inquired of Mahá Kañcana why they all so dreaded possessions; on hearing the explanation, he was greatly moved and asked pardon of the ascetics for his trick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related in the same circumstances as the Kusa Játaka (q.v.).&lt;/p&gt;</data>

In the time of Kassapa Buddha she had been a slave in a brahmin's house. The brahmin, whose name was Asoka, invited eight monks to feed daily at his house and asked his wife to arrange to feed them at a cost of one kahápana each. This she refused to do as did also his daughters; but their slave agreed to carry out this work, and she did it most conscientiously and with great devotion. As a result she was reborn in heaven (J.vi.117f). Her palace was twelve leagues in height and one in extent; it possessed nine storeys and one thousand rooms.

In course of time, however, the brahmins were disturbed by the sight of the king's wealth and adomed and bejewelled women, and became covetous of these. They thereupon induced the king to make offerings and hold sacrifices of animals that these might be for their own gain. Thus righteousuess decayed and disease became prevalent among men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brahmins, pleased with the Buddha's sermon, declared themselves his followers.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Beluvapanduvíná &lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lute carried by Pañcasikha (q.v.); it belonged originally to Mára. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Mára, after wasting seven years trying in vain to discover some shortcoming in the Buddha &lt;span lang="en-us"&gt;-  six years before the Enlightenment and one year after it &lt;span lang="en-us"&gt;-  left the Buddha in disgust and weariness, the lute which he carried slung on his shoulder slipped and fell. Sakka picked it up and gave it to Paññcasikha. It was so powerful that when plucked with the fingers the lovely music produced echoed on for four months (SNA.ii.393f). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The víná was three gávutas in length (BuA.239) and had fifty trestles (AA.i.72). The Sumangala Vilásiní (DA.iii.699) describes it at length. It was pale yellow, like a ripe beluva fruit. Its base (pokkhara) was of gold, its stem of sapphire its strings of silver, and its knots (vethiká) of coral. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The víná was probably so called partly because its base was made of a bilva-fruit, instead of the usual gourd, and partly because of its colour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Bilangika Bháradvája&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bhaaradvaaja')"&gt;Bháradvája&lt;/a&gt; brothers. On hearing that the eldest of the clan had entered the Order, he went to the Buddha, and, unable to speak for rage, sat on one side, sulking. The Buddha preached to him, and he was pleased and entered the Order, becoming an arahant in due course (S.i.164; DhA.iv.163).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commentary explains (SA.1.178f) that he had earned large profits by running a shop for different kinds of excellently prepared &quot;congey&quot; (kañjiká). The name Bilangika (bilanga being another name for such preparations) was given him by the Recensionists at the Third Council.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

The deity of the king's parasol put several questions to the king, but his wise men (Senaka and others) were unable to answer them. The king then sent messengers with gifts to look for Mahosadha; they found him in the potter's hut and brought him back. The king expressed surprise that Mahosadha should have borne him no resentment. Mahosadha pointed out to him that wise men were incapable of ingratitude or meanness.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Beluva&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A village near &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/vesaali')"&gt;Vesáli&lt;/a&gt;, where the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddha')"&gt;Buddha&lt;/a&gt; spent his last vassa. This was ten months before his death (SA.iii.198). According to the Commentaries (e.g., UdA.322; SA.iii.172) the Buddha did not go straight from Beluva to Vesáli, but turned back to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/saavatthi')"&gt;Sávatthi&lt;/a&gt;. He fell grievously ill during this period, but, by a great effort of will, overcame his sickness. During this sickness &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sakka')"&gt;Sákka&lt;/a&gt; ministered to the Buddha, waiting on him and carrying on his head the Buddha's stools when he suffered from acute dysentery (DhA.iii.269 f.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was at this time that the Buddha, in answer to a question by &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/aa/aananda')"&gt;Ananda&lt;/a&gt;, said that he had kept nothing back from his disciples and had no special instructions for the Order to follow after his death. Each disciple must work out his own salvation. D.ii.98 ff.; S.v.151ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ananda is also mentioned as having stayed at Beluva after the Buddha's death. The householder &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/dasama')"&gt;Dasama&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/aa/a5_az')"&gt;Atthakanagara&lt;/a&gt; sought him there, amid their conversation is recorded in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/atthaka_naagara_s')"&gt;Atthakanagara Sutta&lt;/a&gt; (M.i.349ff.; A.v.342ff). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beluva was a small village, and when the Buddha was there the monks stayed in Vesáli. Beluva was just outside the gates of Vesáli (SA.iii.165) and was to the south of this city (MA.ii.571).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Theragáthá (vs.919) states that &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/anuruddha')"&gt;Anuruddha&lt;/a&gt; died at Veluvagáma in the Vajjí country. This probably refers to Beluvagáma, in which </data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Buddhaghosa &lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;1. Buddhaghosa Thera&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The greatest of Commentators on the Tipitaka. He was a Brahmin. The Sás. (p. 29) says his father was a purohita, named Kesa, his mother being Kesí. Gv.66 says his father was the purohita of King Sangáma. He was born in a village near Buddhagayá and became proficient in the Vedas and allied branches of knowledge. One day he met a monk, named Revata, and on being defeated by him in controversy, entered the Order to learn the Buddha's teachings. Because his speech was profound, like that of the Buddha, and because his words spread throughout the world (like those of the Buddha), he came to be called Buddhaghosa. While dwelling with Revata, he wrote the Ñánodaya and the Atthasáliní, and also began to write a Parittatthakathá (a concise commentary) on the Tipitakas. In order to complete his task, he came over to Ceylon at the suggestion of Revata (Sás.p.29, says he was sent to Ceylon as punishment for thinking himself wiser than his teachers) and studied the Singhalese Commentaries at the Mahávihára, under Sanghapála. When his studies were ended he wrote the Visuddhimagga, and having thereby won the approval of the Elders of the Mahávihára, he rendered the Singhalese Commentaries into Páli. During this period he lived in the Ganthákaravihára, and on the accomplishment of his task he returned to Jambudípa. (Burmese tradition says he obtained his copy of the Tipitaka and the Commentaries from the Áloka vihára. But see P.L.C.83, n.1.4).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides the above mentioned works of Buddhaghosa, we have also the Samantapásádiká and the Kankhávitaraní on the Vinaya Pitaka; the Sumangalavilásiní, the Papañcasúdaní, the Sáratthappakásiní and the Manorathapúraní on the Sutta Pitaka. He is also said to have compiled </data>
<data>Commentaries on the Khuddakapátha and the Sutta Nipáta (called the Paramatthajotiká) and on the Dhammapada. He also wrote a series of Commentaries on the Abhidhamma Pitaka (the Atthasáliní, the Sammohavinodaní and the Pañcappakaranatthakathá). Some ascribe to him the Játakatthakathá. For further particulars relating to Buddhaghosa, see Law's &quot;Life and work of Buddhaghosa&quot; and P.L.C.79 ff. The account of his life given here is taken from Cv.xxxvii.215ff . For a list of works ascribed to Buddhaghosa see Gv., pp.59 and 68.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Buddhaghosa. &lt;/b&gt;Called Culla Buddhaghosa to distinguish him from the greater. He was a native of Ceylon (Gv.67), and two works are ascribed to him (Gv.63) -  the Játattagínidána and the Sotattagínidána. The former probably refers to the Játakatthakathá (P.L.C.126). It was at his request that Buddhaghosa (1) wrote his Commentaries to the Abhidhamma. Gv.68. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Their territory was probably near Vethadípa, because the king of Allakappa is mentioned (DhA.i.161) as being in intimate relationship with the king of Vethadípa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

In answer to Ananda's questions, Bhaddaji says that Brahmá is the best of sights; the best of sounds is that of Radiant Devas shouting &quot;Joy, joy,&quot; etc. Ananda says that such is the talk of puthujjanas.

One of the two chief disciples of   &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kassapa')"&gt;Kassapa&lt;/a&gt; Buddha. J.i.43; Bu.xxv.39; SNA.i.293.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;. Bháradvája Thera&lt;/b&gt;. He belonged to the Bháradvájagotta and was a brahmin of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/r/raajagaha')"&gt;Rájagaha&lt;/a&gt;. He sent his son&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kanhadinna_th')"&gt;Kanhadinna&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/t/takkasilaa')"&gt;Takkasilá&lt;/a&gt;, to study under a certain teacher, but, on the way there, the boy met a Thera, entered the Order, and became an arahant. Bháradvája, too, heard the Buddha preach at &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/veluvana')"&gt;Veluvana&lt;/a&gt;, became a monk, and attained arahantship. Later, when Kanhadinna visited the Buddha at Rájagaha, he met his father and learnt from him of his attainments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thirty one kappas ago, Bháradvája met the Pacceka Buddha Sumana and gave him a vallíkára fruit (Thag.vss.177 8; ThagA.i.302f). He is, perhaps, identical with Vallíkáraphaladáyaka of the Apadána. Ap.ii.416; but the same Apadána verses are given under Bhalliya (ThagA.i.49).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Bháradvája Thera. &lt;/b&gt;He was the eldest of a clan of Bháradvájas living in &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/r/raajagaha')"&gt;Rájagaha&lt;/a&gt; and his wife was a Dhanañjáni brahminee. The wife was a devout follower of the Buddha, and constantly sang the praises of the Buddha, of his teachings, and of the Order. Annoyed at this, Bháradvája went to the Buddha and asked a question. He was so pleased with the answer that he joined the Order and not long after became an arahant (S.i.160f), several of his brothers following his example. (See Bháradvája 5)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span lang="en-us"&gt;4. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bháradvája. &lt;/b&gt;A young brahmin, pupil of </data>
<data>&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/t/taarukkha')"&gt;Tárukkha&lt;/a&gt;. A discussion between him and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/va/vaasettha')"&gt;Vásettha&lt;/a&gt; led to the preaching of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/t/tevijja_s')"&gt;Tevijja Sutta&lt;/a&gt; (D.i.235), and also the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/va/vaasettha_sutta')"&gt;Vásettha Sutta&lt;/a&gt; (SN., p.115ff.; M.ii.197f). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bháradvája later became the Buddha's follower (D.i.252; SN., p. 123). The &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/am/agganna_sutta')"&gt;Aggañña Sutta&lt;/a&gt; was preached to him and to Vásettha when they were undergoing the probationary period prior to their becoming fully ordained monks (D.iii.80).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buddhaghosa says (DA.iii.860) that they accepted the Buddha as their teacher at the conclusion of the Vásettha Sutta and entered the Order at the end of the Tevijja Sutta. Later, while meditating on the teachings of the Aggañña Sutta, they became arahants (DA.iii.872). According to Buddhaghosa, Bháradvája belonged to a noble family worth forty five crores (DA.iii.860).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span lang="en-us"&gt;5. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bháradvája. &lt;/b&gt;The name of a brahmin clan; about twenty individuals belonging to this clan are mentioned in the Pitakas. In one family, living at &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/r/raajagaha')"&gt;Rájagaha&lt;/a&gt;, the eldest was married to a Dhanañjáni brahmince and later became an arahant. (See Bháradvája3) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His brothers: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Akkosaka Bháradvája,   &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Asurindaka Bháradvája,     &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Bilangika Bháradvája and   &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Sangárava Bháradvája, followed him (S.i.160ff.; SA.i.175ff.; MA.ii.808).   &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several other Bháradvájas living in Sávatthi visited the Buddha there, and joined the Order and became arahants; viz., &lt;/p&gt;</data>

The gotta was evidently considered to be very ancient. Mention is made in the books of a Bháradvája is among the authors of the runes of the bráhmanas (E.g., D.i.242; M.ii.169, 200; A.iii.224; iv.61, etc.). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kaalingabodhi_jat_479')"&gt;Kálingabodhi Játaka&lt;/a&gt; speaks of a Kálingabháradvája brahmin, while the brahmin carpenter in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pu/phandana_jat_475')"&gt;Phandana Játaka&lt;/a&gt; belongs to the same clan. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The purohita Sucírata, of Dhanañjaya Koravya (in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sambhava_jat_515')"&gt;Sambhava Jataka&lt;/a&gt;), is a Bháradvája, as is also Jújaka of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/vessantara_jat_547')"&gt;Vessantara Játaka&lt;/a&gt;. In a Vinaya passage (Vin.iv.6; but see DA.iii.860) the Bháradvájagotta is mentioned together with the Kosiya as a low clan (hínagotta).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;6. Bháradvája. &lt;/b&gt;A brahmin of the Bháradvája gotta   living at &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kammaasadamma')"&gt;Kammássadhamma&lt;/a&gt;.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Bahuliká, Báhuliká&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A heretical sect among the Buddhists, an offshoot or Gokuliká (Mhv.v.5; Mbv.p.97). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dípavamsa (Dpv.v.41) calls the adherents of this sect Bahusuttaká. According to Tibetan sources (Rockhill, p.183) they derived their name from their teacher, Bahusrutiya. In addition to the five propositions held by the Mahásanghikas, they considered it as a fundamental doctrine that there is no mode of life leading to real salvation, that the truth of suffering is the Noble Truth, that to perceive the suffering of the samskáras is to enter perfect purity, that there is no way of seeing the misery of suffering and the misery of change; the Sangha is but subject to worldly laws and conditions, arahants acquire the doctrine of others, there is a rightly preached way and a right entry into samápatti.

In the time of Vipassí Buddha he was an earth bound deva, and when, at the death of the Buddha, the earth trembled, he realized the Buddha's might and honoured him in his heart. Fourteen kappas ago he was a king named Samita (Ap.i.151f). He is probably identical with Meghiya Thera. ThagA.i.149f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Buddhasaññaka Thera.&lt;/b&gt; Ninety four kappas ago he saw Siddhattha Buddha and his heart was gladdened. Ap.i.252.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Buddhasaññaka. &lt;/b&gt;A hermit in the time of Siddhattha Buddha. Having heard from his pupils of the birth of the Buddha, he set forth from his hermitage to visit him. But he fell ill while yet one hundred and fifty leagues away, and he died full of faith in the Buddha (Ap.ii.420). He is probably identical with Vítasoka Thera. ThagA.i.295f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

The king saw him begging for alms, invited him into the palace and, having shown him great honour, asked him to stay in the park. When the time came for the Bodhisatta to return to the Himálaya, he wished for a pair of single soled shoes and a leaf parasol. But for twelve years he could not summon up enough courage to ask the king for these things! He could only get as far as telling the king he had a favour to ask, and then his heart failed him, for, he said to himself, it made a man weep to have to ask and it made a man weep to have to refuse. In the end the king noticed his discomfiture and offered him all his possessions; but the ascetic would take only the shoes and the parasol, and, with these, he left for the Himálaya. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The king is identified with Ananda.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Belatthasísa Thera&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;An arahant, preceptor of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/aa/aananda')"&gt;Ananda&lt;/a&gt;. He was once afflicted with scurvy and his robes clung to him. The monks thereupon applied water to the robes, but when the Buddha heard of it he made a rule allowing necessary therapeutic measures (Vin.i.202, 295f). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At one time this Thera would lie in the forest where he kept a store of dried boiled rice. When he needed food, after samápatti he would sprinkle water on the rice and eat it instead of going for alms. When this was reported to the Buddha, he blamed Belatthasísa for storing up food and promulgated a rule forbidding this (Vin.iv.86). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dhammapada Commentary (DhA.ii.171), however, states that the offence was committed after the rule was laid down, and, because the food was stored, not because of greed but through lack of covetousness, the Buddha declared Balatthasísa free from guilt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Belatthasísa was a brahmin of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/saavatthi')"&gt;Sávatthi&lt;/a&gt; who had left the world under &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/uruvela_kassapa')"&gt;Uruvela Kassapa&lt;/a&gt; before the Buddha's Enlightenment and was converted when Uruvela Kassapa became a follower of the Buddha. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He had been a monk in the time of Padumuttara Buddha, but could achieve no attainment. He once gave a mátulunga fruit to Vessabhú Buddha (ThagA.i.67 ff.; Thag.vs.16).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is probably identical with &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/m4_may')"&gt;Mátulungaphaladáyaka&lt;/a&gt; of the Apadána.

Bhaddasála.&lt;/b&gt; One of the chief disciples of Nárada Buddha (J.i.37; Bu.x.23). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was a brahmin of Thullakotthita and, together with his friend Vijitamitta, he went in search of the Lake of Immortality (Amatarahada).

Bhikkhu Sutta.&lt;/b&gt; Gains, favours and flattery   are a danger even to an arahant unless the freedom of his will is unshakable.   S.ii.238.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Bhikkhu Sutta.&lt;/b&gt; Once Moggallána and Lakkkhana   saw a Bhikkhu, born as a peta, going through the air, his body, robes, etc.,   on fire. He had been a sinful monk in the time of Kassapa Buddha. S.ii.260.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Bhikkhu Sutta&lt;/b&gt;. A monk asks for a teaching in   brief and the Buddha tells him that that for which a monk has bias, by that is   he reckoned (i.e., he has to give up all bias). The monk dwells in solitude,   reflecting on this, and becomes an arahant. S.iii.34f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Bhikkhu Sutta&lt;/b&gt;. Ignorance consists in   ignorance of the nature of the body, its arising, its cessation and the way   thereto; wisdom is wisdom with regard to these things. The same with the other   khandhas. S.iii.162f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;5. Bhikkhu Sutta. &lt;/b&gt;The Buddha agrees with a group   of monks that if when questioned by other sectarians as to the object of their   holiness, they answer that it is the full knowledge of dukkha, their answer is   right; he proceeds to tell them what should be their answer if questioned as   to what is dukkha. S.iv.50f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;6. Bhikkhu Sutta.&lt;/b&gt; The Buddha tells a monk about   feelings, their arising and cause, their cessation and the way thereto, etc.   S.iv.232.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;7. Bhikkhu Sutta.&lt;/b&gt; A monk asks for a teaching in   brief, and the Buddha tells him that he must have truly pure virtue and   straight view. Standing on sure virtue, he should cultivate the four </data>
<data>  satipatthánas; thus will he reach his goal. The monk follows this teaching and   becomes an arahant. S.v.142f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;8. Bhikku Sutta.&lt;/b&gt; It is by cultivating the four   iddhi-pádas that a monk destroys the ásavas.   S.v.284.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;9.

From there the Buddha proceeded to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/pacinavamsamigadaya')"&gt;Pácínavamsadáya&lt;/a&gt; (Vin.i.350; M.iii.154; DhA.i.47; J.iii.489). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The readings of the texts are uncertain, and it is impossible to say whether a village (gáma) is meant or only a grove (áráma).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reading Bálakalonakáragáma occurs in the Majjhima Commentary (MA.ii.596); but even here two explanations are given: one to the effect that Bálaka was the name of a village of salt makers (? lonakáragáma) belonging to Upáli phapati. When the inhabitants of the village came to Upáli with their taxes, he went with them (bálakagámavásiniyá . . . parisáya) to see Nigantha Nátaputta.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other explanation is that the word bálakiniyá in the text is an adjective meaning &quot;composed of fools&quot; (bálavatiyá bálussannáya) (Cp.,J.i.246, where mention is made of bálagámikamanussá who were obviously fools). The confusion seems, therefore, to have arisen very early. Upáli's village (of Báka), if such a place existed, was probably near Nálandá.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

The Buddha says it is unpleasant for him even to think of a place where monks are given to dispute, but far worse to go to it. Strife is due to the abandonment of dispassionate, benevolent and harmless thinking. Monks who dwell in harmony cultivate these things. A.i.275f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Bhátikábhaya&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also called Bhátika or Bhátiya. Son of Kutakannatissa and king of Ceylon for twenty eight years (38 66 A.C.). He was called Bhátika or Bhátiya because he was the elder brother of Mahádáthika Mahánága. He was very pious, and once had the whole of the Mahá Thúpa covered with sandalwood paste in which were embedded sweet smelling flowers. On another occasion he covered the whole thúpa with flowers and sprinkled them with water drawn by machines from the Abhaya-vápi. He made a plaster covering for the Mahá Thúpa into which were mixed many, cartloads of pearls. A net of coral was made and thrown over the cetiya, and in its meshes were fastened lotus flowers of gold, as large as wagon wheels. One day the king heard the sound of the chanting of arahants in the relic chamber of the Mahá Thúpa, and he lay down resolving not to rise until he had seen them. The theras made a door by which he could enter, and, having seen the glories of the chamber, he described them for the benefit of the people, making figures in illustration of his descriptions. Bhátikábhaya did many other works of merit, held Vesákha festivals, organized offerings for the Bodhi tree, and showed great hospitality to the monks at various places. He was succeeded by his brother Mahádáthika Mahánága (Mhv.xxxiv.38ff.; MT.553f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bhátikábhaya once heard of a skilful judgment being given by Abhidhammika Godha Thera and laid down a rule that all disputes should be taken to the Elder for settlement (Sp.ii.307). On another occasion he appointed a brahmin minister, named Díghakáráyana, to settle a controversy between the monks of Abhayagiri and those of the Mahávihára (Sp.iii.583). He had a queen called Sámadeví who was the daughter of a cattle butcher. A large number of cattle butchers were once brought before the king, but as they were unable to </data>
<data>pay the fine demanded, he appointed them as scavengers in the palace. One of them had a beautiful daughter, and the king fell in love with her and married her. Owing to her, her kinsmen, too, lived in happiness (VibhA.440).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bhátikábhaya once heard a Sutta (see A.v.21f ) in which the Buddha had declared that, of all perfumes, that of jasmine was the strongest. In order to test this the king filled a room with the four kinds of perfume and then placed in it handfuls of various flowers, including jasmine. He then left the room and shut the door. After a while he entered again, and the first scent which greeted him was that of jasmine. Convinced of the truth of the Buddha's statement, he fell prostrate and worshipped him (AA.ii.819). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is said (SA.ii.180) that the king once asked a reciter to tell him of an auspicious stanza (jayamangala) connected with all the Three Jewels. After thinking for a while, he recited the stanza beginning divá tapati ádicco, ratti ábháti candimá (S.ii.284). At the end of the first páda, the reciter saluted the setting sun, at the end of the second the rising moon, at the end of the third the Sangha, and at the end of the stanza he stretched his hands upwards in salutation of the Mahá Thúpa. The king asked him to hold his hands there and placed in them one thousand pieces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Brahmlakoka&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The highest of the celestial worlds, the abode of the Brahmas. It consists of twenty heavens: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;the nine ordinary Brahma-worlds,  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;the five Suddhávásá, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;the four Arúpa worlds, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;the Asaññasatta and &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;the Vehapphala (e.g., VibhA.521). &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;All except the four Arúpa worlds are classed among the Rúpa worlds (the inhabitants of which are corporeal). The inhabitants of the Brahma worlds are free from sensual desires (but see the Mátanga Játaka, J.iv.378, where Ditthamangaliká is spoken of as Mahábrahmabhariyá, showing that some, at least, considered that Mahábrahmas had wives). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Brahma world is the only world devoid of women (DhA.i.270); women who develop the jhánas in this world can be born among the Brahmapárisajjá (see below), but not among the Mahábrahmas (VibhA.437f). Rebirth in the Brahma world is the result of great virtue accompanied by meditation (Vsm.415). The Brahmas, like the other celestials, are not necessarily sotápanna or on the way to complete knowledge (sambodhi-paráyaná); their attainments depend on the degree of their faith in the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha. See, e.g., A.iv.76f.; it is not necessary to be a follower of the Buddha for one to be born in the Brahma world; the names of six teachers are given whose followers were born in that world as a result of listening to their teaching (A.iii.371ff.; iv.135ff.). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Játakas contain numerous accounts of ascetics who practised meditation, being born after death in the Brahma world (e.g., J.ii.43, 69, 90; v.98, etc.). Some of the Brahmas -  e.g., Baka (q.v.) -  held false views regarding their world, which, like all </data>
<data>other worlds, is subject to change and destruction (M.i.327). When the rest of the world is destroyed at the end of a kappa, the Brahma world is saved (Vsm.415; KhpA.121), and the first beings to be born on earth come from the Ábhassara Brahma world (Vsm.417). Buddhas and their more eminent disciples often visit the Brahma worlds and preach to the inhabitants. E.g., M.i.326 f.; ThagA.ii.184ff.; Sikhí Buddha and Abhibhú are also said to have visited the Brahma world (A.i.227f.). The Buddha could visit it both in his mind made body and his physical body (S.v.282f.). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a rock as big as the gable of a house were to be dropped from the lowest Brahma-world it would take four months to reach the earth travelling one hundred thousand leagues a day. Brahmas subsist on trance, abounding in joy (sappítikajjhána), this being their sole food. SA.i.161; food and drinks are offered to Mahábrahmá, and he is invited to partake of these, but not of sacrifices (SA.i.158 f.). Anágámins, who die before attaining arahantship, are reborn in the Suddhávásá Brahma-worlds and there pass away entirely (see, e.g., S.i.35, 60, and Compendium v.10). The beings born in the lowest Brahma world are called Brahma-párisajjá; their life term is one third of an asankheyya kappa; next to them come the Brahma-purohitá, who live for half an asankheyya kappa; and beyond these are the Mahá Brahmas who live for a whole asankheyya kappa (Compendium, v.6; but see VibhA.519f., where Mahá Brahmás are defined).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The term Brahmakáyiká-devá seems to be used as a classs-name for all the inhabitants of the Brahma-worlds (A.i.210; v.76f).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Mahá Niddesa Commentary (p.109) says that the word includes all the five (?) kinds of Brahmá (sabbe pi pañca vokára Brahmáno gahitá).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The BuA.p.10 thus defines the word Brahmá: brúhito tehi tehi gunavisesahí ti=Brahmá. </data>

When the Buddha, immediately after his birth, looked around and took his steps northward, it was this Brahmá who seized the babe by his finger and assured him that none was greater than he.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The names of several Brahmás occur in the books - e.g., &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Tudu&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Nárada&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Ghatikára&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Baka&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Sanankumára&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Sahampatí&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;To these should be added the names of seven Anágámís resident in Avihá and other Brahma worlds   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Upaka, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Phalagandu, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Pukkusáti, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Bhaddiya, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Khandadeva, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Báhuraggi and &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Pingiya (S.i.35, 60; SA.i.72 etc.). &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Baka speaks of seventy two Brahmás, living, apparently, in his world, as his companions (S.i.142).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;See also Tissa Brahmá.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are described as Mahá Brahmás. Mention is also made of Pacceka Brahmás -  e.g., Subrahmá and Suddhavása (S.i.146f).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tudu is also sometimes described as a Pacceka Brahmá (e.g., S.i.149). Of the Pacceka Brahmás, Subrahmá and Suddhavása are represented as visiting another Brahmá, who was infatuated with his own power and glory, and as challenging him to the performance of miracles, excelling him therein and converting him to the faith of the Buddha. Tudu is spoken of as exhorting Kokálika to put his trust in Sáriputta and Moggallána (Loc. Cit.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No explanation is given of the term Pacceka Brahmá. Does </data>
<data>it mean Brahmás who dwelt apart, by themselves? Cp. Pacceka-Buddha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Brahmás are represented as visiting the earth and taking an interest in the affairs of men. Thus, Nárada descends from the Brahma-world to dispel the heresies of King Angati (J.vi.242f). When the Buddha hesitates to preach his doctrine, because of its profundity, it is Sahampati (q.v.) who visits him and begs him to preach it for the welfare of the world. The explanation given (e.g., at SA.i.155) is that the Buddha waited for the invitation of Sahampati that it might lend weight to his teaching. The people were followers of Brahmá, and Sahampati's acceptance of the Buddha's leadership would impress them deeply. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sahampatí is mentioned as visiting the Buddha several times subsequently, illuminating Jetavana with the effulgence of his body. It is said that with a single finger he could illuminate a whole Cakkavála (SA.i.158). Sanankumára (q.v.) was also a follower of the Buddha. The Brahmás appear to have been in the habit of visiting the deva worlds too, for Sanankumára is reported as being present at an assembly of the Távatimsa gods and as speaking there the Buddha's praises and giving an exposition of his teaching. But, in order to do this, he assumed the form of Pañcasikha (D.ii.211ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The books refer (e.g., at D.i.18, where Brahmá is described as vasavattí issaro kattá nimmátá, etc.) to the view held, at the Buddha's time, of Brahmá as the creator of the universe and of union with Brahmá as the highest good, only to be attained by prayers and sacrifices. But the Buddha himself did not hold this view amid does not speak of any single Brahmá as the highest being in all creation. See, however, A.v.59f., where Mahá Brahmá, is spoken of as the highest denizen of the Sahassalokadhátu (yávatá sahassalokadhátu, Mahá-Brahmá tattha aggam akkháyati); but he, too, is </data>
<data>impermanent (Mahá-Brahmúno pi . . . atthi eva aññathattam, atthi viparinámo).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are Mahá Brahmás, mighty and powerful (abhibhú anabhibhúto aññadatthudaso vasavattí), but they too, all of them, and their world are subject to the laws of Kamma. E.g., at S.v.410 (Brahmaloko pi ávuso anicco adhuvo sakkáyapariyápanno sádháyasmá Brahmaloká cittam vutthápetvá sakkáyanirodhacittam upasamharáhi). See also A.iv.76f., 104f., where Sunetta, in spite of all his great powers as Mahá Brahmá, etc., had to confess himself still subject to suffering. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To the Buddha, union with Brahmá seems to have meant being associated with him in his world, and this can only be attained by cultivation of those qualities possessed by the Brahmá. But the highest good lay beyond, in the attainment of Nibbána. Thus in the Tevijjá Sutta; see also M.ii.194f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The word Brahma is often used in compounds meaning highest and best -  e.g., Brahmacariyá, Brahmassara; for details see Brahma in the New Páli Dictionary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Bandhula&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Son of a chieftain of the &lt;b&gt;Mallas&lt;/b&gt; in &lt;b&gt;Kusinárá&lt;/b&gt;. He studied at &lt;b&gt;Takkasilá&lt;/b&gt; with &lt;b&gt;Maháli&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Pasenadi&lt;/b&gt;. On his return home, he wished to give an exhibition of his skill, and the princely families of the Mallas bound sticks of bamboo in bundles of sixty, inserting a strip of iron in each bundle; they then suspended the bundles in the air and challenged Bandhula to cut them down. He leapt up in the air and smote them with his sword, but on discovering the treachery of his kinsmen, he threatened to kill them all; his parents, however, dissuaded him, and he went to live in Sávatthi, where Pasenadi appointed him Senápati. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bandhula's wife was &lt;b&gt;Malliká&lt;/b&gt; (known as &lt;b&gt;Bandhula&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;-&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Malliká&lt;/b&gt; in order to distinguish her from the wife of Pasenadi). As she bore no children, Bandhula wished to send her back to her people; but when she went to bid farewell to the Buddha before her departure, he asked her to return to her husband. He accepted her, thereby showing his faith in the Buddha. Soon after she conceived a child, and her pregnancy longing was to enter the lotus tank used by the princes of &lt;b&gt;Vesáli&lt;/b&gt; on their coronation and to drink its water. Bandhula took her to Vesáli, drove away the strong guards who were posted at the lotus tank, and let Malliká enjoy it to her heart's content. When the &lt;b&gt;Licchavi&lt;/b&gt; princes heard of this, they were greatly enraged and pursued Bandhula's chariot, in spite of the warning of Maháli. When the chariots of the Licchavis came into line, Bandhula, in order to frighten them, twanged his bow; but as they still pursued him, he shot a single arrow, which pierced each of the </data>
<data>five hundred Licchavis through his girdle without their being aware of the wound. Bandhula told them of their plight; but they refused to believe him until they loosed the girdle of the foremost and he fell down dead. Thereupon they returned to their homes, bade farewell to their families, and fell dead on the moment of loosening their armour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Malliká bore twin sons sixteen times; each of them became perfect in the various arts, and each had a retinue of one thousand men. One day, Bandhula retried a case, which had been unjustly decided by the judge and his decision was greatly applauded. The king, hearing the applause and learning the reason, appointed him judge. It is probably this incident, which is referred to at S.i.74 (&lt;b&gt;Atthakarana Sutta&lt;/b&gt;); see also KS.i.101, n.3. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the former judges poisoned the king's mind against Bandhula, and the king, listening to them, sent Bandhula and his sons to quell a frontier rebellion, giving orders that they should all be murdered on the way home. This was done, and the news of the massacre was brought to Malliká while she was entertaining five hundred monks led by the two Chief Disciples (according to MA.ii.753 the Buddha was also present). Malliká read the message, and placing it in a fold of her dress, went on with her duties. &lt;b&gt;Sáriputta&lt;/b&gt; discovered her fortitude at the end of the meal and greatly praised her. Malliká sending for her daughters in law, broke the news to them, urging them to harbour no resentment against the king. The king's spies, discovering this, brought the news to Pasenadi. The king was greatly moved, and having sent for Malliká, begged her forgiveness and granted her a boon. She chose as her boon that she and her thirty two daughters in law should be allowed to return home to &lt;b&gt;Kusinárá&lt;/b&gt;. Bandhula's nephew, &lt;b&gt;Díghakáráyána&lt;/b&gt;, was appointed </data>
<data>commander-in chief, but he never forgave the injury to Bandhula, and, in the end, brought about Pasenadi's deposition and consequent death (DhA.i.228f., 349 56; J.iv.148 ff.; MA.ii.753f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bandhula isi sometimes referred to as &lt;b&gt;Bandhulamalla&lt;/b&gt;. (E.g., J.iv.148.) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bandhula's wife, Malliká, was one of the three persons possessing the &lt;b&gt;Mahálatápasádhana&lt;/b&gt;, the others being &lt;b&gt;Visákhá&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Devadániyacora&lt;/b&gt; (but see DhA.i.412, where the daughter of Báránasísetthi is substituted for Devadániya).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the time of her husband's death Malliká laid aside the pasádhana, but, on the day on which the Buddha's body was being removed for cremation, she washed the pasádhana in perfumed water and placed it on the body, which it completely covered. She expressed the wish that, as long as she remained in samsára, her body should need no ornament. DA.ii.597.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

He was the son of Jetthatissa and led a very pious life. He was renowned as a great physician, and various miraculous cures are attributed to him, even snakes seeking his assistance. A jewel, which he received from a snake in gratitude for a cure, he placed in the stone image in the Abhayagiri vihára.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A medical work, the Sáratthasangaha, in Sanskrit, is ascribed to him (but see Cv. Trs. 13, n. 7). It is said that he appointed a royal physician for every ten villages, and established hospitals for the crippled and for the dumb and also for animals. He appointed preachers to look after the people's spiritual welfare. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among religious buildings erected by him was the Moraparivena. He extended his patronage to a holy monk, named Mahádhammakathí, who translated the suttas into Singhalese. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buddhadása had eighty sons, named after the Buddha's eminent disciples, the eldest being Upatissa II. who succeeded him.

Once, when the Buddha visited Kapilavatthu and wanted lodging for the night, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahanama_th')"&gt;Mahánáma&lt;/a&gt; suggested that he should go to the hermitage of Bharandu. The Buddha acted on this suggestion and spent the night there.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Mahánáma arrived the next morning, the Buddha talked to him about the three kinds of teachers:  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;those who have full comprehension of sense desires only but not of objects   of sense or of feelings; &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;those who have full comprehension of sense desires and of objects of   sense; and &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;those who have comprehension of all three. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Would their conclusions coincide, or would they differ?  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here Bharandu chimed in and asked Mahánáma to say they would be the same. But the Buddha contradicted him, whereupon Bharandu said they would be different; but the Buddha again contradicted him, and even, also, a third time. Grieved at being slighted by the Buddha in the presence of Mahánáma, an important &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sakya')"&gt;Sákiyan&lt;/a&gt;, Bharandu left &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kapilavatthu')"&gt;Kapilavatthu&lt;/a&gt;, never to return (A.i.276 f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commentary explains (AA.i.458) that he had lived in the same hermitage as the Buddha, when they were both pupils of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/aa/aalara_kaalaama')"&gt;Alárakálama&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bharandu had the reputation of being able to secure the best and choicest alms in the city.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Bhaddaji Thera&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The son of a setthi in &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bhaddiya')"&gt;Bhaddiya&lt;/a&gt;. He was worth eighty crores, and was brought up in luxury like that of the Bodhisatta in his last birth. When Bhaddaji was grown up, the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddha')"&gt;Buddha&lt;/a&gt; came to Bhaddiya to seek him out, and stayed at the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/j/jaatiyaavana')"&gt;Játiyávana&lt;/a&gt; with a large number of monks. Thither Bhaddaji went to hear him preach. He became an arahant, and, with his father's consent, was ordained by the Buddha. Seven weeks later he accompanied the Buddha to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kotigaama')"&gt;Kotigáma&lt;/a&gt;, and, while the Buddha was returning thanks to a pious donor on the way, Bhaddaji retired to the bank of the Ganges outside the village, where he stood wrapt in jhána, emerging only when the Buddha came by, not having heeded the preceding chief theras. He was blamed for this; but, in order to demonstrate the attainments of Bhaddaji, the Buddha invited him to his own ferry boat and bade him work a wonder. Bhaddaji thereupon raised from the river bed, fifteen leagues into the air, a golden palace twenty leagues high, in which he had lived as &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahapanaada')"&gt;Mahápanáda&lt;/a&gt;.

<data>&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/n/nanduttara')"&gt;Nanduttara&lt;/a&gt;, whose hospitality the Buddha and his monks had accepted, saw this miracle of Bhaddaji, and himself wished for similar power by which he might procure relics in the possession of others. He was reborn as the novice &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/sonuttara')"&gt;Sonuttara&lt;/a&gt;, who obtained the relics for the thúpas of Ceylon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/padumuttara')"&gt;Padumuttara&lt;/a&gt; Buddha, Bhaddaji was a brahmin ascetic who, seeing the Buddha travelling through the air, offered him honey, lotus stalks, etc. Soon after he was struck by lightning and reborn in &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/t/tusita')"&gt;Tusita&lt;/a&gt;.

The incidents of Baka's previous life are referred to but without detail (S.i.142 f). Cp. Brahmanimantika Sutta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This sutta cannot be identical with the Bakabrahma Sutta mentioned in Theragáthá Commentary and quoted there in full (ii. 185 f). It is stated there that once when the Buddha was at Jetavana a certain Brahmá conceived the view that no monk or recluse could come to his world. The Buddha, aware of this, went to the Brahma world and stood in the air enveloped in flame.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was followed by Moggallána, Kassapa, Kappina and Anuruddha. Moggallána asked the Brahmá if he still held the same view, to which he replied that he no longer thought that he was eternal. (This shows that the Brahmá of the story was most probably Baka.)  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the Buddha and his followers had departed, the Brahmá sent one of his retinue to Moggallána to find out if there were other disciples of the Buddha as mighty as he. Moggallána's answer was that there were many such (the sutta is given at S.i.144 ff., but there the name given is “Aparáditthi” Sutta).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

They found many such in the forest, but no road by which to transport them. At last they discovered a lordly sála tree in the king's park and made preparations to cut it down. The deity of the tree (Bhaddasála 2), who was the Bodhisatta, was greatly distressed at the prospect of the destruction of his children. He, therefore, visited the king by night and begged him not to have the tree cut down. When the king refused this request, Bhaddasála asked that the tree should be cut down in pieces, so that in its fall it might not damage its kindred round about. This feeling of Bhaddasála for his kinsmen touched the king, and he desisted from his purpose of destroying the tree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related in reference to the Buddha's interference with Vidúdabha (q.v.) when he wished to destroy the Sákyans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ananda is identified with the king (J.iv.153 7).

Following the advice of the Bodhisatta, he went with a large band of country men, and when the tiger was sighted he waited in a thicket and lay flat on his face. When he knew that the tiger had been killed, he came out of the thicket trailing a creeper in his hand and blamed the people, saying that he had meant to lead the tiger like an ox to the king and had gone into the wood to find a creeper for that purpose. &quot;Who has killed the tiger and spoilt all my plans?&quot; he asked. &quot;I will report all of you to the king.&quot; The terrified people bribed him heavily and said no word as to who had killed the tiger. The king, believing that Bhímasena himself had killed it, rewarded him handsomely. The same thing happened with a buffalo. Bhímasena grew rich and began to neglect the Bodhisatta. Soon after, a hostile king marched on Benares. Bhímasena went with a large army riding on an elephant, the Bodhisatta behind him, but at the sight of the battlefield Bhímasena was so terrified that he fouled the elephant's back. The Bodhisatta taunted him and sent him home, while he himself captured the enemy king and brought him to the king of Benares, who showed him all honour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related in reference to a monk who, although of low family, used to boast of that family's greatness. The truth was </data>
<data>discovered and his pretensions exposed. He is identified with Bhímasena. J.i.355-9.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

The king was pleased with her quickness and decency, and having sent for her made her his chief queen. Their son became a Cakkavatti.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to the fat wife of a Licchavi prince. The monks expressed surprise that he should love her, but the Buddha pointed out that she was healthy and cleanly in her house (J.i.420 ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the course of the Játaka, the woman is referred to as a báhiyá, which the scholiast explains by bahijanapadavásí. Báhiya here, therefore, probably means &quot;rustic.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

When Mahágovinda divided Jambudípa into seven equal portions for Renu and his six friends, Brahmadatta was given the kingdom, of the Assakas, with Potama as his capital.

In most cases we are told nothing further of them than that they reigned at Benares at the time of the incidents related in the story. Brahmadatta, was probably the dynastic name of the kings of Benares. Thus, for instance, in the Gangamála Játaka (J.iii.452) Udaya, king of Benares, is addressed as Brahmadatta. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Gandatindu Játaka (J.v.102-106) however, Pañcála, king of Uttarapañcála, is also called Brahmadatta; in this case it was evidently his personal name. It was also the name of the husband of Pingiyáni (q.v.). He was a king, but we are not told of what country. He is identified (J.v.444) with Kunála.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Brahmadatta Thera&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span lang="en-us"&gt;&lt;b&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;He was the son of the king of Kosala, and, having witnessed the Buddha's majesty at the consecration of Jetavana, he entered the Order and in due course became an arahant. One day, while going for alms, he was abused by a brahmin, but kept silence. Again and again the brahmin abused him, </data>
<data>and the people marvelled at the patience of Brahmadatta, who then preached to them on the wisdom of not returning abuse for abuse.

Brahmadatta&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span lang="en-us"&gt;&lt;b&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;A Pacceka Buddha. In the time of Kassapa Buddha he had been a monk and had lived in the forest for twenty thousand years. He was then born as the son of the king of Benares. When his father died he became king, ruling over twenty thousand cities with Benares as the capital, but, wishing for quiet, he retired into solitude in the palace. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His wife tired of him and committed adultery with a minister who was banished on the discovery of his offence. He then took service under another king and persuaded him to attack Brahmadatta. Brahmadatta's minister, much against his will, and having promised not to take life, made a sudden attack on the enemy and drove them away. Brahmadatta, seated on the field of battle, developed thoughts of metá and became a Pacceka Buddha. SNA.i.58ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;7.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Bodhisatta&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The name given to a being who aspires to Bodhi or Enlightenment. The Commentaries (e.g., DA.ii.427) define the word thus: Bodhisatto ti panditasatto bujjhanakasatto; bodhisankhátesu vá catusu maggesu ásatto laggamánaso ti Bodhisatto. See also AA.i.453. For a discussion of the meaning of the word see Har Dayal: The Bodhisativa Doctrine, pp.4ff. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The word can therefore be used in reference to all those who seek Nibbána, including Buddhas, Pacceka Buddhas, and the disciples of Buddhas (Buddha-paccekabuddha-buddha-sávaká), but is commonly used only of those beings who seek to become Buddhas. The word may have been used originally only in connection with the last life of a Buddha, in such contexts as &quot;in the days before my Enlightenment, when as yet I was only a Bodhisatta”. E.g., M.i.17, 114, 163; so also in the Mahápadána Sutta (D.ii.13) and the Acchariyaabbhutadhamma Sutta (M.iii.119). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But already in the Kathávatthu (e.g., 283 90, 623) the previous lives of Gotama Buddha and other saints had begun to excite interest and speculation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the developed form of the ideas regarding Bodhisattas, a Bodhisatta's career started with his making a resolution before a Buddha (abhiníhárakarana or múlapanidhána) to become a Buddha for the welfare and liberation of all creatures. In later literature, the abhiníhára is preceded by a period during which the Bodhisatta practises manopanidhi, when he resolves in his mind to desire to become a Buddha without declaring this intention to others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the abhiníhára to be effective, eight conditions should be fulfilled (Bu.ii.59; explained at BuA.75f. and SNA.i.48f): the aspirant should be &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;(1) a human being, &lt;/li&gt;</data>
<data>  &lt;li&gt;(2) a male, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;(3) sufficiently developed to become an arahant in that   very birth, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;(4) a recluse at the time of the declaration,   &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;(5) he should declare his resolve before a Buddha,  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;(6) should be possessed of attainments such as the   jhánas, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;(7) be prepared to sacrifice all, even life, and   &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;(8) his resolution should be absolutely firm and   unwavering. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the case of Gotama Buddha, his abhiníhára was made at Amaravátí in the presence of Dípankara Buddha. His name at that time was Sumedha (q.v.). The Buddha, before whom the abhiníhára is made, looks into the future and, if satisfied, declares the fulfilment of the resolve, mentioning the particulars of such fulfilment. This declaration is called vyákarana, and is made also by all subsequent Buddhas whom the Bodhisatta may meet during his career. Having received his first vyákarana, the Bodhisatta proceeds to investigate the qualities which should be acquired by him for the purposes of Buddhahood (buddhakárakadhammá), in accordance with the custom of previous Bodhisattas. These he discovers to be ten in number, the Ten Perfection, (dasapárami):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;dána, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;síla, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;nekkhamma, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;paññá, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;viriya, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;khanti, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;sacca, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;aditthána, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;mettá and &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;upekhá. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bu.ii.116ff. Sometimes thirty páramí are spoken of, each of the ten being divided into three, varying in kind and degree. Thus, in the case of &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;dána, the dánapárami consists in giving one's limbs,</data>
<data>  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;dána upapárami in giving away one's external   possessions and &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;dánapáramatthapáramí in giving one's life, this last   being the most excellent. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the case of Gotama Buddha, examples of births in which the ten párami were practised to the highest degree are as follows: the Ekarája, Khantivádí, Cúlla-Sankhapála, Mahájanaka, Mahásutasoma, Múgapakkha, Lomahamsa, Sattubhattaka, Sasa, and Sutasoma Játakas (BuA. 50; J.i.44f). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also develops the four Buddhabhúmi (catasso buddhabhúmiyo) -  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;ussáha, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;ummagga, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;avatthána and &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;hitacariyá -    &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;explained respectively as zealousness (viriya), wisdom (paññá), resolution (adhitthána) and compassion (mettábhávaná). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He cultivates the six ajjhásayas which conduce to the maturing of Enlightenment (bodhiparipákiyá samvattanti), these six being: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;nekkhammajjhásaya, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;pavivekajjhásaya, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;alobhajjhásaya, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;adosajjhásaya, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;amohajjhásaya and &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;nissaravajjhásaya. SNA.i.50&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Bodhisatta, during his career, escapes from being born in eighteen inauspicious states (atthárasa abhabbatthánáni). He is never born blind, deaf, insane, slobbery (elamúga) or crippled, or among savages (milakkkesu), in the womb of a slave, or as a heretic. He never changes his sex, is never guilty of any of the five ánantarikakammas, and never becomes a leper. If born as an animal, he never becomes less than a quail or more than an elephant. He is never born either among various classes of petas nor among the Kálakañjakas, neither in Avíci nor in the lokantaraka nirayas, neither as Mára, nor in worlds </data>
<data>where there is no perception (asaññibhava), nor in the Suddhávásas, nor in the Arúpa worlds, nor ever in another Cakkavála. SNA.i.50 f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides practising the (thirty) párami, all Bodhisattas must make the five great sacrifices (mahápariccágá) -  giving up &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;wife, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;children, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;kingdom, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;life and &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;limb (J.vi.552)   &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;and must fulfil the three kinds of conduct (cariyá) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;ñátatthacariyá, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;lokatthacariyá and &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;buddhiatthacariyá   &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;and the seven mahádanas as practised by Vessantara, which caused the earth to quake seven times. DA.ii.427; DhA.iii.441; the BuA. (116 f.) gives a story about Mangala Buddha which corresponds to that of Vessantara in regard to Gotama Buddha. See Kharadáthika.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The length of a Bodhisatta's career varies; some practice the páramí for at least four asankheyyas and one hundred thousand kappas, others for at least eight asankheyyas and one hundred thousand kappas, and yet others for sixteen asankheyyas and one hundred thousand kappas. The first of these periods is the very least that is required and is intended for those who excel in wisdom (paññá). The middle is for those who excel in faith (saddhá); and the last and highest for those whose chief feature is perseverance (viriya) (SNA.i.47 f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In their penultimate life all Bodhisattas are born in Tusita (see Buddha), where life lasts for fifty seven crores and six million years, but most Bodhisattas leave Tusita before completing their life span. Vipassí, e.g., was among the exceptions (DA.ii.427).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the time for the announcement of their last birth approaches, all is excitement because of various signs appearing in the ten </data>
<data>thousand world systems. The devas of all the worlds assemble in Tusita and request the Bodhisatta to seek birth as a human being, that he may become the Buddha. The Bodhisatta withholds his reply until he has made the Five Great Investigations (pañcamahávilokaná) regarding time, continent, place of birth, his mother and the life span left to her. Buddhas do not appear in the world when men live to more than one hundred thousand years or to less than one hundred. They are born only in Jambudípa and in the Majjhimadesa, and only of a khattiya or brahmin clan. The Bodhisatta's mother in his last birth must not be passionate or given to drink; she should have practised the párami for one hundred thousand kappas, have kept the precepts inviolate from birth, and should not be destined to live more than ten months and seven days after the conception of the Bodhisatta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having satisfied himself as to these particulars, the Bodhisatta goes with the other devas to Nandanavana in Tusita, where he announces his departure from their midst and disappears from among them while playing. On the day of his conception, the Bodhisatta's mother takes the vows of fasting and celibacy at the conclusion of a great festival, and when she has retired to rest, she dreams that the Four Regent Gods take her with her bed, bathe her in the Anotatta Lake, clad her in divine garments, and place her in a golden palace surrounded by all kinds of luxury. As she lies there the Bodhisatta in the form of a white elephant enters her womb through her right side. The earth trembles and all the ten thousand world systems are filled with radiance. Immediately the Four Regent Gods assume guard over mother and child. Throughout the period of pregnancy, which lasts for ten months; exactly, the mother remains free from ailment and sees the child in her womb sitting crossed legged (like a preacher on a dais, says the Commentary DA.ii.436). At the end of </data>
<data>the ten months; she gives birth to the child, standing in a grove, never indoors. Suddhávása brahmins, free from all passion, first receive the child in a golden net, and from them the Four Regent Gods take him on an antelope skin and present him to his mother. Though the Bodhisatta is born free of the mucous otherwise present at birth, two showers of water -  one hot, the other cold -  fall from the sky and bathe mother and child. The child then takes seven strides to the north, standing firmly on his feet, looks on all sides, and seeing no one anywhere to equal him, announces his supremacy over the whole world and the fact that this is his last birth. (Gotama Buddha as the Bodhisatta, spoke, in three different births, as soon as born -  as Mahosadha, as Vessantara, and in his last birth, J.i.53). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seven days after birth his mother dies. She dies because she must bear no other being. The Bodhisatta's time of conception is so calculated that the mother's destined life span completes itself seven days after his birth. From the Commentary (DA.ii.437; UdA.278) account it would appear that the age of the Bodhisatta's mother at the time of his birth is between fifty and sixty (majjhimavayassa pana dve kotthásá atikkamma tatiyekottháse).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bodhisatta's last birth is attended by various miracles. The Commentaries see, in the various incidents connected with the Bodhisatta's last birth, signs of various features, which came, later, to be associated with the Buddha and his doctrine; for details see DA.ii.439ff. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soothsayers, being summoned, see on the child's body the thirty two marks of a Great Man (mahápurisa), (for details of these see D.ii.17ff.; M.ii.136f. The reasons for these marks are given at D.iii.145ff ) and declare that the child will become either a Cakkavatti or a Buddha. His father, desiring that his child shall be a Cakkavatti rather than a Buddha, </data>
<data>brings him up in great luxury, hiding from him all the sin and ugliness of the world. But the destiny of a Bodhisatta asserts itself, and he becomes aware of the presence in the world of old age, disease, death and the freedom of mind to be found in the life of a Recluse. In the case of some Bodhisattas (e.g., Vipassí) these four signs (nimittáni as they are called) are seen by them at different times, but in the case of others on one and the same day (DA.ii.457).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Urged by the desire to discover the cause of suffering in the world and the way out of it, the Bodhisatta leaves the world on the day of his son's birth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Some Bodhisattas leave the world riding on an elephant   (e.g., Dípankara, Sumana, Sumedha, Phustsa, Sikhí and Konágamana),   &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;some on a chariot (e.g., Kondañña, Revata, Paduma,   Piyadassí, and Kakusandha), &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;some on a horse (e.g., Mangala, Sujáta, Atthadassí,   Tissa, Gotama), and &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;some in a palanquin (e.g., Anomadassí, Siddhattha and   Vessabhú). &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Some, like Nárada, go on foot, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;while Sobhita, Dhammadassí and Kassapa travelled in the   palaces of their lay life.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having left the world, the Bodhisatta practises the austerities, the period of such practices varying. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;In the case of Dípankara, Kondañña, Sumana, Anomadassí,   Sujáta, Siddhattha and Kakusandha it was ten months; &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;for Mangala, Sumedha, Tissa and Sikhí it was eight;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;for Revata seven; &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;for Piyadassí, Phussa, Vessabhú and Konágamana six;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;for Sobhita four; &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;for Paduma, Atthadassí and Vipassí two weeks;   &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;for Nárada, Padumuttara, Dhammadassí and Kassapa one </data>

The size of this seat varies;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;the seats of Dípankara, Revata, Piyadassí, Atthadassí,   Dhammadassí and Vipassí were fifty-three hands in   length; &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;those of Kondañña, Mangala, Nárada and Sumedha fifty   seven hands; &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;that of Sumana sixty hands; &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;those of Sobhita, Anomadassí, Paduma, Padumuttara and   Phussa thirty eight; &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;of Sujáta thirty two; &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;of Kakusandha twenty six; &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;of Konágamana twenty; &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;of Kassapa fifteen; &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;of Gotama fourteen (BuA. 247). &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before the Enlightenment the Bodhisatta has five great dreams: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;(1) that the world is his couch with the Himálaya as   his pillow, his left hand resting on the eastern sea, his right on the   western, and his feet on the southern; &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;(2) that a blade of tiriyá(kusa) grass growing from his   navel touches the clouds; &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;(3) that white worms with black heads creep up from his   feet, covering his knees; &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;(4) that four birds of varied hues from the four   quarters of the world fall at his feet and become white; &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;(5) that he walks to and fro on a heap of dung, by   which he remains unsoiled. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the explanations of these dreams see A.iii.240f.; </data>
<data>these dreams are referred to at J.i.69.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next day the Bodhisatta sits cross legged on his seat facing the east, determined not to rise till he has attained his goal. The gods of all the worlds assemble to do him honour, but Mára (q.v.) comes with his mighty hosts and the gods flee. All day, the fight continues between Mára and the Bodhisatta; the párami alone are present to lend their aid to the Bodhisatta, and when the moment comes, the Goddess of the Earth bears witness to his great sacrifices, while Mára and his armies retire discomfited at the hour of sunset, the gods then returning and singing a paean of victory. Meanwhile the Bodhisatta spends the night in deep concentration; during the first watch he requires knowledge of past lives, during the second watch he develops the divine eye, while during the last watch he ponders over and comprehends the Paticca-samuppáda doctrine. Backwards and forwards his mind travels over the chain of causation and twelve times the earth trembles. With sunrise, omniscience dawns on him, and he becomes the Supremely Awakened Buddha, uttering his udáná of victory, while the whole world rejoices with him. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the Paticca-Samuppada see D.ii.31ff.; for the other details see J.i.56ff., where the story of Gotama is given. DA.ii.462ff gives similar details regarding Vipassí; BuA.248 says it is the same for all Bodhisattas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The above is a brief account, as given in the books, of certain features common to all Bodhisattas. In addition to these, particulars of the personal career of the Bodhisatta who became Gotama, are found, chiefly in the Buddhavamsa and the Játakatthakathá. It has already been stated that each Bodhisatta receives the vyákarana from every Buddha whom he meets, and Gotama was no exception. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;He received his first vyákarana as the ascetic Sumedha, </data>

The wishes of Bodhisattas are generally fulfilled (J.iii.283; v.282, 291; vi. 401, 405, etc.), chiefly because of their great wisdom (J.iii.282) and zeal (J.iii.425).

This account is called the Lomasakangiya-Bhaddekaratta Sutta (M.iii.199ff). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Extracts from the Bhaddekaratta Sutta are uttered by speakers in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/h/hatthipala_jat_509')"&gt;Hatthipála Játaka&lt;/a&gt; (J.iv.481) and the&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahakapi_jat_407_516')"&gt;Mahákapi Játaka&lt;/a&gt; (J.v.66).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;1. Buddha&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A generic name, an appellative -  but not a proper name - given to one who has attained Enlightenment (na mátará katam, na pitará katam – vimokkhantikam etam buddhánam bhagavantánam bodhiyá múle ... paññatti, MNid.458; Ps.i.174) a man superior to all other beings, human and divine, by his knowledge of the Truth (Dhamma).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The texts mention two kinds of Buddha: viz.,  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/pacceka_buddha')"&gt;Pacceka Buddhas&lt;/a&gt; - i.e., Buddhas who also attain to complete Enlightenment but do not preach the way of deliverance to the world; and &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Sammásambuddhas, who are omniscient and are teachers of Nibbána (Sattháro).   &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commentaries, however (e.g., SA.i.20; AA.i.65) make mention of four classes of Buddha: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Sabaññu-Buddhá&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Pacceka Buddhá&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Catusacca Buddhá &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Suta Buddhá&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;All arahants (khínásavá) are called Catusacca Buddhá and all learned men Bahussuta Buddhá. A Pacceka Buddha practises the ten perfections (páramitá) for two asankheyyas and one hundred thousand kappas, a Sabbañu Buddha practises it for one hundred thousand kappas and four or eight or sixteen asankheyyas, as the case may be (see below).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seven Sabbaññu Buddhas are mentioned in the earlier books; these are  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/vipassii')"&gt;Vípassí&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/sikhii')"&gt;Sikhí&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/vessabhuu')"&gt;Vessabhú&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kakusandha')"&gt;Kakusandha&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/konaagamana')"&gt;Konágamana&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</data>

Thag.491; J.ii.147; they are also mentioned at Vin.ii.110, in an old formula against snake bites. Beal (Catena, p. 159) says these are given in the Chinese Pátimokkha. They are also found in the Sayambhú Purána (Mitra, Skt. Buddhist Lit. of Nepal, p. 249).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This number is increased in the later books. The &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddhavamsa')"&gt;Buddhavamsa&lt;/a&gt; contains detailed particulars of twenty five Buddhas, including the last, Gotama, the first twenty four being those who prophesied Gotama's appearance in the world. They are the predecessors of Vipassí, etc., and are the following: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Dípankara, Kondañña, Mangala, Sumana, Revata, Sobhita, Anomadassí, Paduma, Nárada, Padumuttara, Sumedha, Sujáta, Piyadassí, Atthadassí, Dhammadassí, Siddhattha, Tissa and Phussa. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same poem, in its twenty seventh chapter, mentions three other Buddhas -  Tanhankara, Medhankara and Saranankara -  who appeared in the world before Dípankara. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Lalitavistara has a list of fifty four Buddhas and the Mahávastu of more than a hundred. The &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/cakkavattisihanaada_s')"&gt;Cakkavatti Síhanáda Sutta&lt;/a&gt; (D.iii.75ff ) gives particulars of&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/me_mu/metteyya')"&gt;Metteyya Buddha&lt;/a&gt; who will be born in the world during the present kappa. The&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/anaagatavamsa')"&gt;Anágatavamsa&lt;/a&gt; gives a detailed account of him. Some MSS. of that poem (J.P.T.S. 1886, p. 37) mention the names of ten future Buddhas, all of whom met Gotama who prophesied about them. These are Metteyya, Uttama, Ráma, Pasenadi Kosala, Abhibhú, Díghasoní, Sankacca, Subha, </data>
<data>Todeyya, Nálágiripalaleyya (sic). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahapadana_s')"&gt;Mahápadána Sutta&lt;/a&gt; (D.ii.5f ) which mentions the seven Buddhas gives particulars of each under eleven heads (paricchedá) -  the kappa in which he is born, his social rank (játi), his family (gotta), length of life at that epoch (áyu), the tree under which he attains Enlightenment (bodhi), the names of his two chief disciples (sávakayuga), the numbers present at the assemblies of arahants held by him (sávakasannipáta), the name of his personal attendant (upatthákabhikkhu), the names of his father and mother and of his birthplace. The Commentary (DA.ii.422ff) adds to these other particulars -  the names of his son and his wife before his Renunciation, the conveyance (yána) in which he leaves the world, the monastery in which his Gandhakuti was placed, the amount of money paid for its purchase, the site of the monastery, and the name of his chief lay patron. In the case of Gotama, the further fact is stated that on the day of his birth there appeared also in the world Ráhulamátá, Ananda, Kanthaka, Nidhikumbhi (Treasure Trove), the Mahábodhi and Káludáyí. Gotama was conceived under the asterism (nakkhatta) of Uttarásálha, under which asterism he also made his Renunciation (Da.ii425), preached his first sermon and performed the Twin Miracle. Under the asterism of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/visaakha')"&gt;Visákha&lt;/a&gt; he was born, attained Enlightenment and died; under that of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/maagha')"&gt;Mágha&lt;/a&gt; he held his first assembly of arahants and decided to die; under Assayuja he descended from Távatimsa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddhavamsa Commentary says (BuA.2f) that in the Buddhavamsa particulars of each Buddha are given under twenty two heads, the additional heads being the details of the first sermon, the numbers of those attaining realization of truth (abhisamaya) at each assembly, the names of the </data>
<data>two chief women disciples, the aura of the Buddha's body (ramsi), the height of his body, the name of the Bodhisatta (who was to become Gotama Buddha), the prophecy concerning him, his exertions (padhána) and the details of each Buddha's death. The Commentary also says that mention must be made of the time each Buddha lived as a householder, the names of the palaces he occupied, the number of his dancing women, the names of his chief wife, and his son, his conveyance, his renunciation, his practice of austerities, his patrons and his monastery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are eight particulars in which the Buddhas differ from each other (atthavemattáni). These are length of life in the epoch in which each is born, the height of his body, his social rank (some are born as khattiyas, others as brahmins), the length of his austerities, the aura of his body (thus, in the case of Mangala, his aura spread throughout the ten thousand world systems, while that of Gotama extended only one fathom; - but when he wishes, a Buddha can spread his aura at will, BuA.106); the conveyance in which he makes his renunciation, the tree under which he attains Enlightenment, and the size of the seat (pallanka) under the Bodhi tree. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only the first five are mentioned in DA.ii.424; also at BuA.105; all eight are given at BuA.246f., which also gives details under each of the eight heads, regarding all the twenty five Buddhas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the case of all Buddhas, there are four fixed spots (avijahitatthánáni). These are:  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;the site of the seat under the Bodhi tree (bodhipallanka), &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;the Deer Park at &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/i_/isipatana')"&gt;Isipatana&lt;/a&gt; where the first sermon is preached, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;the spot where the Buddha first steps on the ground at Sankassa on his descent from Tusita (Távatimsa?)&lt;/li&gt;</data>
<data>  &lt;li&gt;the spots marked by the four posts of the bed in the Buddha's   &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/g/gandhakuti')"&gt;Gandhakuti&lt;/a&gt;   in Jetavana. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The monastery may vary in size; the site of the city in which it stands may also vary, but not the site of the bed. Sometimes it is to the east of the vihára, sometimes to the north (DA.ii.424; BuA.247).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thirty facts are mentioned as being true of all Buddhas (samatimsavidhá dhammatá). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;In his last life every Bodhisatta is conscious at the moment of his conception; &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;in his mother's womb he remains cross legged with his face turned outwards; &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;his mother gives birth to him in a standing posture; &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;the birth takes place in a forest grove (araññe); &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;immediately after birth he takes seven steps to the north and roars the &quot;lion's roar&quot;; &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;he makes his renunciation after seeing the four omens and after a son is born to him; &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;he has to practise austerities for at least seven days after donning the yellow robe; &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;he has a meal of milk rice on the day of his Enlightenment; &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;he attains to omniscience seated on a carpet of grass; &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;he practises concentration in breathing; &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;he defeats Mára's forces; &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;he attains to supreme perfection in all knowledge and virtue at the foot of the Bodhi tree; &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Mahá Brahmá requests him to preach the Dhamma; &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;he preaches his first sermon in the Deer Park at &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/i_/isipatana')"&gt;Isipatana&lt;/a&gt;;   &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;he recites the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/patimokkha')"&gt;Pátimokkha&lt;/a&gt; to the </data>
<data>fourfold assembly on the full moon day of Mágha; &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;he resides chiefly in &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/j/jetavana')"&gt;Jetavana&lt;/a&gt;, he performs the Twin Miracle in &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/saavatthi')"&gt;Sávatthi&lt;/a&gt;;   &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;he preaches the Abhidhamma in &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/t/taavatimsa')"&gt;Távatimsa&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;he descends from there at the gate of Sankassa; &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;he constantly lives in the bliss of phalasamápatti; &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;he investigates the possibility of converting others during two jhánas; &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;he lays down the precepts only when occasion arises for them; &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;he relates Játakas when suitable occasions occur; &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;he recites the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddhavamsa')"&gt;Buddhavamsa&lt;/a&gt; in the assembly of his kinsmen;   &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;he always greets courteously monks who visit him; &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;he never leaves the place where he has spent the rainy season without bidding farewell to his hosts; &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;each day he has prescribed duties before and after his meal and during the three watches of the night; &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;he eats a meal containing flesh (mamsarajabhojana) immediately before his death; &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;and just before his death he enters into the twenty four crores and one hundred thousand samápattí. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are also mentioned four dangers from which all Buddhas are immune: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;no misfortune can befall the four requisites intended for a Buddha; &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;no one can encompass his death; &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;no injury can befall any of his thirty two  &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahapurisa')"&gt;Mahápurisalakkhaná&lt;/a&gt; or eighty anubyañjaná;   &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;nothing can obstruct his aura (BuA.248). &lt;/li&gt;</data>
<data>&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Buddha is born only in this Cakkavála out of the ten thousand Cakkaválas which constitute the játikkhetta (AA.i.251; DA.iii.897). There can appear only one Buddha in the world at a time (D.ii.225; D.iii.114; the reasons for this are given in detail in Mil. 236, and quoted in DA.iii.900f). No Buddha can arise until the sásana of the previous Buddha has completely disappeared from the world. This happens only with the dhátuparinibbána (see below). When a Bodhisatta takes conception in his mother's womb in his last life, after leaving Tusita, there is manifested throughout the world a wonderful radiance, and the ten thousand world systems tremble.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similar earthquakes appear when he is born, when he attains Enlightenment, when he preaches the first sermon, when he decides to die, when he finally does so (D.ii.108f.; cp. DA.iii.897).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahapadana_s')"&gt;Mahápádána Sutta&lt;/a&gt; (D.ii.12-15) and the&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/am/acchariyabbhuta_s')"&gt;Acchariya-bbhuta-dhamma Sutta&lt;/a&gt; (M.iii.119-124) contain accounts of other miracles, which attend the conception and birth of a Buddha. Later books (e.g., J.i.) have greatly enlarged these accounts. They describe how the Bodhisatta, having practised the thirty Páramí, and made the five great gifts (pañcamahápariccágá), and thus reached the pinnacle of the threefold cariyá -  ñátattha-cariyá, lokattha-cariyá and buddhi-cariyá -  gives the seven mahádáná, as in the case of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/vessantara')"&gt;Vessantara&lt;/a&gt;, making the earth tremble seven times, and is born after death in Tusita. The Bodhisatta, who later became Vipassí Buddha, remained in Tusita during the whole permissible period -  fifty seven crores and sixty seven thousand years. But most Bodhisattas leave Tusita before completing the full span of life there. Five signs appear to warn the devaputta that his </data>
<data>end is near (see Deva); the gods of the ten thousand worlds gather round him, beseeching him to be born on earth that he may become the Buddha. The Bodhisatta thereupon makes the five investigations (pañcamahávilokanáni).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes only one Buddha is born in a &lt;a href="http://www.palikanon.com/english/wtb/g_m/kappa')"&gt;kappa&lt;/a&gt;, such a kappa being called Sárakappa; sometimes two, Mandakappa; sometimes three, Varakappa; sometimes four, Sáramandakappa; rarely five, Bhaddakappa (BuA.158f). No Buddha is born in the early period of a kappa, when men live longer than one hundred thousand years and are thus not able to recognize the nature of old age and death, and therefore not able to benefit by his preaching. When the life of man is too short, there is no time for exhortation and men are full of &lt;a href="http://www.palikanon.com/english/wtb/g_m/kilesa')"&gt;kilesa&lt;/a&gt;. The suitable age for a Buddha is, therefore, when men live not less than one hundred years and not more than ten thousand. The Bodhisatta must first consider the continent and the country of birth. Buddhas are born only in &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/j/jambudiipa')"&gt;Jambudípa&lt;/a&gt;, and there, too, only in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/majjhimadesa')"&gt;Majjhimadesa&lt;/a&gt;. He must then consider the family; Buddhas are born only in brahmin or khattiya families, whichever is more esteemed during that particular age. Then he must think of the mother: she must be wise and virtuous; and her life must be destined to end seven days after the Buddha's birth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having made these decisions, the Bodhisatta goes to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/n/nandanavana')"&gt;Nandanavana&lt;/a&gt; in Tusita, and while wandering about there &quot;falls away&quot; from Tusita and takes conception. He is aware of his death but unaware of his cuti-citta or dying thought. The Commentators seem to have differed as to whether there is </data>
<data>awareness of conception. When the Bodhisatta is conceived, his mother has no further wish for indulgence in sexual pleasure. For seven days previously she observes the uposatha vows, but there is no mention of a virgin birth; the birth might be called parthenogenetic (see Mil.123).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the day of the actual conception, the mother, having bathed in scented water after the celebration of the Asálha festival, and having eaten choice food, takes upon herself the &lt;a href="http://www.palikanon.com/english/wtb/u_v/uposatha')"&gt;uposatha&lt;/a&gt; vows and retires to the adorned state bedchamber. As she sleeps, she dreams that the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/caatummahaaraajikaa')"&gt;Four Regent Gods&lt;/a&gt; raise her with her bed, and, having taken her to the Himálaya, bathe her in Lake Anotatta, robe her in divine clothes, anoint her with perfumes and deck her with heavenly flowers (according to the Nidánakathá, J.i.50, it is their queens who do these things, re the Bodhisatta assuming the form of an elephant, see Dial.ii.116n). Not far away is a silver mountain and on it a golden mansion. There they lay her with her head to the east. The Bodhisatta, assuming the form of a white elephant, enters her room, and after circling right wise three times round her bed, smites her right side with his trunk and enters her womb. She awakes and tells her husband of her dream. Soothsayers are consulted, and they prophesy the birth of a &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/cakkavatti')"&gt;Cakka-vatti&lt;/a&gt; or of a Buddha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two suttas mentioned above speak of the circumstances obtaining during the time spent by the child in his mother's womb. It is said (DA.ii.437) that the Bodhisatta is born when his mother is in the last third of her middle age. This is in order that the birth may be easy for both mother and child. Various miracles attend the birth of the Bodhisatta. The Commentaries </data>
<data>expound, at great length, the accounts of these miracles given in the suttas. Immediately after birth the Bodhisatta stands firmly on his feet, and having taken seven strides to the north, while a white canopy, is held over his head, looks round and utters in fearless voice the lion's roar: &quot;Aggo 'ham asmi lokassa, jettho 'ham asmi lokassa, settho 'ham asmi lokassa, ayam antimá játi, natthi dáni punabbhavo” (D.ii.15). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To the later Buddhists, not only these acts of the Bodhisatta, but every item of the miracles accompanying his birth, have their symbolical meaning. See, e.g., DA.ii.439; thus, standing on the earth means the attaining of the four iddhi-pádas; facing north implies the spiritual conquest of multitudes; the seven strides are the seven bojjhangas; the canopy is the umbrella of emancipation; looking round means unveiled knowledge; fearlessness denotes the irrevocable turning of the Wheel of the Law; the mention of the last birth, the arahantship he will attain in this life, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There seems to have been a difference of opinion among the Elders of the Sangha as to what happened when the Bodhisatta took his seven strides northwards. Did he walk on the earth or travel through the air? Did people see him go? Was he clothed? Did he look an infant or an adult? Tipitaka Culábhaya, preaching on the first floor of the Lohapásáda, settled the question by suggesting a compromise: the Bodhisatta walked on earth, but the onlookers felt he was traveling through the air; he was naked, but the onlookers felt he was gaily adorned; he was an infant, but looked sixteen years old; and after his roar he reverted to infancy! (DA.ii.442)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After birth, the Bodhisatta is presented to the soothsayers for their prognostications and they reassert that two courses alone are open to him   either to be a Cakka-vatti or a Buddha. They also </data>
<data>discover on his body the thirty two marks of the Great Man (&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahapurisa')"&gt;Mahápurisa&lt;/a&gt;) (These are given at D.ii.17 19; also M.ii.136f). The Bodhisatta has also the eighty secondary signs (asíti anubyañjana) such as copper coloured nails glossy and prominent, sinews which are hidden and without knots, etc. (The list is found in Lal. 121 [106]). The Brahmáyu Sutta (for details see M.ii.137f) gives other particulars about Gotama, which are evidently characteristic of all Buddhas. Thus, in walking he always starts with the right foot, his steps are neither too long nor too short, only his lower limbs move; when he gazes on anything, he turns right round to do so (nágavilokana). When entering a house he never bends his body (Cp. DhA.ii.136); when sitting down, accepting water to wash his bowl, eating, washing his hands after eating, or returning thanks, he sits with the greatest propriety, dignity and thoroughness. When preaching, he neither flatters nor denounces his hearers but merely instructs them, rousing, enlightening and heartening them (M.ii.139). His voice possesses eight qualities: it is frank, clear, melodious, pleasant, full, carrying, deep and resonant; it does not travel beyond his audience (for details concerning his voice see DA.ii.452f.; and MA.ii.771f). A passage in the Anguttara (A.iv.308) says that a Buddha preaches in the eight assemblies -  of nobles, brahmins, householders, recluses, devas of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/caatummahaaraajikaa')"&gt;Cátummahárájika&lt;/a&gt; world, and of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/t/taavatimsa')"&gt;Távatimsa&lt;/a&gt;, of Máras and of Brahmás. In these assemblies he becomes one of them and their language becomes his.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The typical career of a Buddha is illustrated in the life of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/g/gotama')"&gt;Gotama&lt;/a&gt;. He renounces the world only after the birth of a son. This, </data>
<data>the Commentary explains (DA.ii.422), is to prevent him from being taken for other than a human being. He sees the four omens before his Renunciation: an old man, a sick man, a dead man, and a recluse. Some Buddhas see all four on the same day, others, like &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/vipassii')"&gt;Vipassí&lt;/a&gt;, at long intervals (DA.ii.457). On the night before the Enlightenment, the Bodhisatta dreams five dreams (A.iii.240). After the Enlightenment the Buddha does not preach till asked to do so by Mahá &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/brahmaloka')"&gt;Brahmá&lt;/a&gt;. This is on order that the world may pay greater attention to the Buddha and his teaching (DA.ii.467). A Buddha generally travels from the Bodhi tree to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/i_/isipatana')"&gt;Isipatana&lt;/a&gt; for his first sermon, through the air, but Gotama went on foot because he wished to meet &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/upaka')"&gt;Upaka&lt;/a&gt; on the way (DA.ii.471).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha's day is divided into periods, each of which has its distinct duties (DA.i.45f; SNA.i.131f, etc.). He rises early, and having attended to his bodily functions, sits in solitude till the time arrives for the alms round. He then puts on his outer robe and goes for alms, sometimes alone, sometimes with a large following of monks. When he wishes to go alone he keeps the door of his cell shut, which sign is understood by the monks (Ibid., 271). Occasionally he goes long distances for alms, travelling through the air, and then only khínásavá are allowed to accompany him (ThagA.i.65). Sometimes he goes in the ordinary way (pakatiyá), sometimes accompanied by many miracles. After the meal he returns to his cell; this is the pure bhattakicca.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having washed his feet, he would emerge from his cell, talk to the monks and admonish them. To those who ask for subjects of meditation, he would give them according to their temperament. He would then </data>
<data>retire to his cell and, if he so desire, sleep for a while. After that, he looks around the world with his divine eye, seeking whom he may serve, and would then preach to those who come to him for instruction. In the evening he would bathe, and then, during the first watch, attend to monks seeking his advice. The middle watch is spent with devas and others who visit him to question him. The last watch is divided into three parts: the first part is spent in walking about for exercise and meditation; the second is devoted to sleep; and the third to contemplation, during which those who are capable of benefiting by the Buddha's teaching, through good deeds done by them in the past, come into his vision. Only beings that are veneyyá (capable of benefiting by instruction) and who possess upanissaya, appear before the Buddha's divine eye (DA.ii.470).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha gives his visitors permission to ask what they will. This is called Sabbaññupavárana, and only a Buddha is capable of holding to this promise to answer any question (SNA.i.229). Except during the rains, the Buddha spends his time in wandering from place to place, gladdening men and inciting them to lead the good life. This wandering is called cáriká and is of two kinds -  turita and aturita. The first is used for a long journey accomplished by him in a very short time, for the benefit of some particular person. Thus Gotama travelled three gávutas to meet &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/maha_kassapa_th')"&gt;Mahá Kassapa&lt;/a&gt;, thirty yojanas to see &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/aa/aalavaka')"&gt;Alavaka&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/angulimaala')"&gt;Angulimála&lt;/a&gt;, forty five yojanas to see &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pu/pukkusati')"&gt;Pukusáti&lt;/a&gt;, etc. In the case of aturita cáriká progress is slow. The range of a Buddha's cáriká varies from year to year. Sometimes he would tour the Mahámandala of nine hundred yojanas, sometimes </data>
<data>the Majjhimamandala of nine hundred yojanas, sometimes only the Antomandala of six hundred yojanas. A tour of the Mahámandala occupies nine months, that of the Majjhimamandala eight, and that of the Antomandala from one to four months. Details of the cáriká and the reasons for them are given at length in DA.i.240 3. When the Buddha cannot go on a journey himself, he sends his chief disciples (SNA.ii.474). The Buddha announces his intention of undertaking a journey two weeks before he starts, so that the monks may get ready (DhA.ii.167).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha is omniscient, not in the sense that he knows everything, but that he could know anything should he so desire (see MNid.178,179; see also MNidA.223; SNA.i.18.). His ñáña is one of the four illimitables (neither can the Buddha's body be measured for purposes of comparison with other bodies, MA.ii.790). He converts people in one of three ways: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;by exhibition of miraculous powers (iddhipátiháriya), &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;by reading their thoughts (ádesanápátiháriya), &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;or teaching them what is beneficial to them according to their character and temperament (anusásanípátiháriya). &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is the last method, which the Buddha most often uses (BuA.81) The Buddha's rivals say that he possesses the power of fascination (ávattanímáyá); but this is untrue, as sometimes (e.g., in the case of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kosambii')"&gt;Kosambi&lt;/a&gt; monks) he cannot make even his own disciples obey him. Some beings, however, can be converted only by a Buddha. They are called buddha veneyyá (SNA.i.331). Some are pleased by the Buddha's looks, others by his voice and words, yet others by his austerities, such as the wearing of simple robes, etc.; and finally, those whose standard of judgment is goodness, reflect that he is without a peer (DhA.iii.113f.). &lt;/p&gt;</data>
<data>&lt;p&gt;Though the Buddha's teaching is never really lost on the listener, he sometimes preaches knowing that it will be of no immediate benefit (see, e.g., &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/udumbarika_s')"&gt;Udumbarikasíhanáda Sutta&lt;/a&gt;, D.iii.57). It is said that wherever a monk dwells during the Buddha's time, in the vicinity of the Buddha, he would always have ready a special seat for the Buddha because it is possible that the Buddha would pay him a special visit (DA.i.48). Sometimes the Buddha will send a ray of light from his &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/g/gandhakuti')"&gt;Gandhakuti&lt;/a&gt; to encourage a monk engaged in meditation and, appearing before him in this ray of light, preach to him. Stanzas so preached are called obhásagáthá (SNA.i.16, 265).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every Buddha founds an Order; the first pátimokkhuddesagáthá of every Buddha is the same (DA.ii.479). The attainment of arahantship is always the aim of the Buddha's instruction (DA.iii.732). Beings can obtain the four abhiññá only during the lifetime of a Buddha (AA.i.204). A Buddha has ten powers (baláni) which consist of his perfect comprehension in ten fields of knowledge, &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A.v.32f.; M.i.69, etc. At S.ii.27f., ten similar powers are given as consisting of his knowledge of the &lt;a href="http://www.palikanon.com/english/wtb/n_r/paticca_samuppaada')"&gt;Paticasamuppáda&lt;/a&gt;. The powers of a disciple are distinct from those of a Buddha (Kvu.228); they are seven (see, e.g., D.iii.283) and physical strength equal to that of one hundred thousand crores of elephants (BuA.37). He alone can digest the food of the devas or food which contains the ojá put into it by the devas. No one else can eat with impunity the food which has been set apart for the Buddha (SNA.i.154). Besides these excellences, a Buddha possesses the four assurances (vesárajjáni, given at M.i.71f)), the eighteen ávenikadhammá*, and the sixteen anuttariyas**. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
<data>&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;*Described at Lal. 183, 343, Buddhaghosa also gives (at   DA.iii.994) a list of eighteen buddhadhammá, but they are all concerned with   the absence of duccarita in the case of the Buddha.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;**Given by Sáriputta in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sampasadaniya_s')"&gt;Sampasádániya Sutta&lt;/a&gt;   (D.iii.102ff.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The remembrance of former births a Buddha shares with six classes of purified beings, only in a higher degree. This faculty is possessed in ascending scale by titthiyá, pakatisávaká, mahásávaká, aggasávaká, pacceka buddhá and buddhá (E.g.,Vsm.411).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every Buddha holds a &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/maha_samaya_s')"&gt;Mahásamaya&lt;/a&gt;, and only a Buddha is capable of preaching a series of suttas to suit the different temperaments of the mighty assembly gathered there (D.ii.255; DA.ii.682f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Buddha is not completely immune from disease (e.g., &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/g/gotama')"&gt;Gotama&lt;/a&gt;). Every Buddha has the power of living for one whole kappa,&quot; but no Buddha does so, his term of life being shortened by reason of climate and the food he takes (DA.ii.413). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commentary explains (DA.ii.554f.) that kappa here means áyukappa, the full span of a man's life during that particular age. Some, like Mahásíva Thera, maintained that if the Buddha could live for ten months, overcoming the pains of death, he could as well continue to live to the end of this Bhaddakappa. But a Buddha does not do so because he wishes to die before his body is overcome by the infirmities of old age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No Buddha, however, dies till the &lt;a href="http://www.palikanon.com/english/wtb/s_t/saasana')"&gt;sásana&lt;/a&gt; is firmly established (D.iii.122).  There are three parinibbáná in the case of a Buddha: kilesa parinibbána, khandha parinibbána and dhátu parinibbána. The first </data>
<data>takes place under the Bodhi tree, the second at the moment of the Buddha's death, the third long after (DA.iii.899f.; for the history of Gotama's relics see &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/g/gotama')"&gt;Gotama&lt;/a&gt;). Some Buddhas live longer than others; those that are digháyuka have only sammukhasávaká (disciples who hear the Doctrine from the Buddha himself), and at their death their relics are not scattered, only a single thúpa being erected over them (SNA. 194, 195). Short lived Buddhas hold the &lt;a href="http://www.palikanon.com/english/wtb/u_v/uposatha')"&gt;uposatha&lt;/a&gt; once a fortnight; others (e.g. &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kassapa')"&gt;Kassapa&lt;/a&gt; Buddha) may have it once in six months; yet others (e.g. &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/vipassii')"&gt;Vipassí&lt;/a&gt;) only once in six years (ThagA.i.62).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the Buddha's death, his Doctrine is gradually forgotten. The first Pitaka to be lost is the Abhidhamma, beginning with the Patthána and ending with the Dhammasangani. Then, the Anguttara Nikáya of the Sutta Pitaka, from the eleventh to the first Nipáta; next the Samyutta Nikáya from the Cakkapeyyála to the Oghatarana; then the Majjhima, from the Indriyabhávaná Sutta to the Múlapariyáya Sutta, and then the Dígha, from the Dasuttara to the Brahmajála. Scattered gáthá like the Sabhiyapucchá, and the Álavakapucchá, last much longer, but they cannot maintain the sásana. The last Pitaka to disappear is the Vinaya, the last portion being the mátiká of the Ubhatovibhanga (VibhA.432).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a Buddha dies, his body receives the honours due to a monarch (these are detailed at D.ii.141f). It is said that on the night on which a Buddha attains Enlightenment, and on the night during which he dies, the colour of his skin becomes exceedingly bright (D.ii.134). Here we have the beginning of a legend which later grew into an account of an actual &quot;transfiguration&quot; of the Buddha.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
<data>&lt;p&gt;At all times, where a Buddha is present, no other light can shine (SNA.ii.525).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No Buddha is born during the samvattamánakappa, but only during the vivattamánakappa (SNA.i.51). A Bodhisatta who excels in paññá can attain Buddhahood in four asankheyyas; one who exels in saddhá, in eight, and one whose viriya is the chief factor, in sixteen (SNA.i.47f). When once a being has become a Bodhisatta there are eighteen conditions from which he is immune (SNA.i.50). The Buddha is referred to under various epithets. The Anguttara Nikáya gives one such list. There he is called Samana, Bráhmana, Vedagú, Bhisaka, Nimmala, Vimala, Ñání and Vimutta (C.iv. 340). Buddhaghosa gives seven others: Cakkkumá, Sabbabhútanukampí, Vihátaka, Márasenappamaddí, Vusitavá, Vimutto and Angirasa (DA.iii.962f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha generally speaks of himself as Tathágata. This term is explained at great length in the Commentaries -  e.g., DA.i.59f. His followers usually address him as Bhagavá, while others call him by his name (Gotama). In the case of Gotama Buddha, we find him also addressed as Sakka (SN. vs. 345; perhaps the equivalent of Sákya), Brahma (SN. p.91; SNA.ii.418), Mahámuni (BuA.38) and Yakkha (M.i.386; also KS.i.262). Countless other epithets occur in the books, especially in the later ones. One very famous formula, used by Buddhists in their ritual, contains nine epithets, the formula being: Bhagavá araham sammásambuddho, vijjácaranasampanno, sugato, lokavidú, anuttaro, purisadammasárathi, satthá devamanussánam, Buddho Bhagavá (these words are analysed and discussed in Vsm. 198 ff). It is maintained (e.g., DA.i.288) that the Buddha's praises are limitless (aparimána). One of his most striking characteristics, mentioned over and over again, is his love of quiet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;E.g., D.i.178f.; he is also fond of solitude (patissallána), </data>
<data>(D.ii.70; A.iv.438f.; S.v.320f., etc.). When he is in retirement it is usually akála for visiting him (D.ii.270). There are also certain accusations, which are brought against a Buddha by his rivals, for this very love of solitude. &quot;It is said that his insight is ruined by this habit of seclusion. By intercourse with whom does he attain lucidity in wisdom? He is not at his ease in conducting an assembly, not ready in conversation, he is occupied only with the fringe of things. He is like a one eyed cow, walking in a circle&quot; (D.iii.38).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this his disciples followed his example (D.iii.37). The dwelling place of a Buddha is called &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/g/gandhakuti')"&gt;Gandhakuti&lt;/a&gt;. His footprint is called Padacetiya, and this can be seen only when he so desires it. When once he wishes it to be visible, no one can erase it. He can also so will that only one particular person shall see it (DhA.iii.194). It is also said that his power of love is so great that no evil action can show its results in his presence (SNA.ii.475). A Buddha never asks for praise, but if his praises are uttered in his presence he takes no offence (ThagA.ii.42). When the Buddha is seated in some spot, none has the power of going through the air above him (SNA.i.222). He prefers to accept the invitations of poor men to a meal (DhA.ii.135).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;See also &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/g/gotama')"&gt;Gotama&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bodhisatta')"&gt;Bodhisatta&lt;/a&gt;.

The C.H.I. (i.175) says that the Bhaggá were members of the Vajjian confederacy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bhagga country lay between Vesáli and Sávatthi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was while sojourning in the Bhagga country that Moggallána was attacked by Mára entering into his stomach (M.i.332), and it was there that he preached the Anumána Sutta (M.i.95). Sirimanda and the parents of Nakula were inhabitants of the Bhagga country, and Sigálapitá (ThagA.i.70) went there in order to meditate; there he became an arahant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Apadána (Ap.ii.359) the Bhaggá are mentioned with the Kárusá.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

The Buddha tells the monks of his visit to Baka Brahmá, who holds the view that this world is eternal. The Buddha tells Baka that his view is false, whereupon Mára, having taken possession of one of the Brahmás, protests and urges the Buddha not to be recalcitrant. Baka himself agrees with the Buddha, who tells him of planes of existence of which Baka knows nothing. Baka then says that he will vanish from the Buddha's presence, but finds himself unable to do so. The Buddha then vanishes and repeats a stanza for the Brahmás to hear. Baka admits defeat, but Mára again enters into a Brahmá and asks the Buddha not to communicate his doctrine to others. The Buddha refuses to agree to this. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sutta is so called because it was preached on account of Baka Brahmá's challenge (M.i.326ff). Cp.

The fish was caught by an angler and sold to the wife of a Benares councillor.* When the fish was split open the child was discovered unhurt, and cherished by the councillor's wife as her own son. On discovering his story, she asked permission of his parents to keep him. The king decided that the two families should have him in common, hence his name Bákula (two families - bi kin).** &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;* This preservation of Bakkula was due to the power of the sanctity of his last life; it was a case of psychic power diffused by knowledge (ñánavipphárá iddhi), PS.ii.211; Vsm.379.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** Cp. the explanation of bakkula in J.P.T.S. 1886, pp. 95ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a prosperous life, at the age of eighty, Bakkula heard the Buddha preach and left the world. For seven days he remained unenlightened, but on the dawn of the eighth day he became an arahant. Later, the Buddha declared him to be foremost in good health (A.i.25; for a problem connected with this, see Mil.215ff.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Anomadassí Buddha, he was a learned Brahmin who became a holy hermit. He heard the Buddha preach and became his follower, and when the Buddha suffered from stomach trouble, he cured him and was reborn later in the Brahma world. In the time of Padumuttara Buddha, he was a householder of Hamsavatí, and, hearing a monk acclaimed as most healthy, he wished for a similar honour in a future life. Before the appearance of Vipassí Buddha, he was born in Bandhumatí, where he became a hermit. Later, he saw the Buddha, acknowledged him as teacher, and cured a monk of </data>
<data>tinapupphakaroga (? hay fever).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Kassapa Buddha, he renovated an old vihára and provided the monks with medicaments (AA.i.168 ff.; MA.ii.928 ff.; ThagA.i.434 ff.; Ap.i.328 ff.; PSA.491). Bakkula lived to a very old age* (AA.ii.596), and shortly before his death ordained Acela Kassapa, who had been his friend in his lay days.** Bakkula was one of the four who had great abhiññá (mahábhiññappattá) in the time of Gotama Buddha, the others being the two chief disciples and Bhaddá Kaccáná (AA.i.204). He is often mentioned (E.g., MA.i.348) as an example of a monk who practised asceticism without preaching it to others. Fifty five kappas ago he was a king named Anoma (v.l. Aranemí) (Ap.i.329).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; * according to the Bakkula Sutta (M.iii.125), he was eighty years a monk. This is confirmed by DA.ii.413, where his age is given as 160.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** See Bakkula Sutta below.

Having provided him with a wife, much against his will, she died soon after. When his wife was with child, he wished to go away and became an ascetic, but his wife persuaded him to stay. On her second conception he ran away and, becoming an ascetic, rejoiced in his freedom from the bonds of wife and family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related when some monks reported to the Buddha that a gang of thieves had been taken captive by &lt;b&gt;Pasenadi&lt;/b&gt; and put in chains. No chains were stronger than those of passion, said the Buddha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;J.i.139ff.; cp. &lt;b&gt;Bandhana Sutta&lt;/b&gt; (2); the verses given in the Játaka are also found there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

There were then no birds in Báveru, and the people, marvelling at the sight, bought the bird, after much bargaining, for one hundred pieces and paid it great honour. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On another voyage, the same merchants brought with them a peacock (the Bodhisatta), and this bird, after much show of reluctance on the part of the merchants, was sold to the people of Báveru for one thousand pieces. From the time of the arrival of the more beautiful peacock, the crow was entirely neglected and flew away on to a refuse heap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to the fact that from the time the Buddha appeared in the world, the heretics lost all their glory.

Bhúta Thera. &lt;/b&gt;The son of a very wealthy councillor of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/saketa')"&gt;Sáketa&lt;/a&gt;, his last and only child, the others having been devoured by a &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/y/yakkha')"&gt;Yakkha&lt;/a&gt;. The child was, therefore, well guarded at his birth, but the Yakkha had meanwhile gone to wait on &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/vessavana')"&gt;Vessavana&lt;/a&gt; and had not returned. The boy was called Bhúta so that non humans might protect him. He grew up in great luxury, but, like &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/y/yasa')"&gt;Yasa&lt;/a&gt;, having heard the Buddha preach at Sáketa, he entered the Order and dwelt on the banks of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/am/ajakaranii')"&gt;Ajakaraní&lt;/a&gt;, where he attained arahantship. Later, when visiting his relations, he stayed in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/anjana_vana')"&gt;Añjanavana&lt;/a&gt;. They besought him to remain there, but this he refused to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Siddhattha Buddha he was a brahmin and, seeing the Buddha, he sang his praises in four verses. Fourteen kappas ago he became king four times under the name of Uggata. Thag.vs.518 26; ThagA.i.493ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is probably identical with Parappasádaka Thera of the Apadána.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Brahmajála Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first sutta of the Dígha Nikáya. It was preached to the paribbájaka Suppiya and his disciple Brahmadatta. It first explains the sílá, or moral precepts, in three successive sections   cúla (concise), majjhima (medium), and mahá (elaborate)   and then proceeds to set out in sixty two divisions various speculations and theories regarding the &quot;soul&quot; (D.i.46). Other names for it are Atthajála, Dhammajála, Ditthijála, and Sangámavijaya. At the end of the discourse the ten world systems trembled (D.i.46). It is said that once when Pinndapátiya Thera recited this sutta at the Kalyániya vihára, his mind concentrated on the Buddha, the earth trembled; the same phenomenon occurred when the Díghabhánaka Theras recited it at the Ambahtthiká, to the east of the Lohapásáda (DA.i.131).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Brahmaj'ála was the first sutta preached in Suvannabhúmi, when Sona and Uttara visited it as missionaries (Mhv.xii.51).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Sutta is often quoted, sometimes even in the Canon. E.g., S.iv. 286, 287.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Bhagandha Hatthaka Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The headman Bhadragaka visits the Buddha at Uruvelakappa and asks for a teaching about dukkha. The Buddha says he will talk neither of the future nor of the past, but only of the present. By means of questioning Bhadragaka, the Buddha makes him realize that sorrow and suffering come only through desire. For example, he would grieve if anything happened to his friends in Uruvelakappa, or to his son Ciravási, or to his wife; but he would not worry about those who were unknown to him and therefore unloved by him (S.iv.327f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commentary says (SA.iii.103) that in this sutta vattadukkha (? the sorrow of transmigration) is described.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

The Buddha answers that while yet a Bodhisatta he was assailed by the same doubts. Fear comes only to him whose heart is filled with desire and longing, and who is restless, witless, and drivelling. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the man, who is pure, resolute, and free from corruptions of the heart, lives in confidence in the forest and develops the jhánas. The Buddha then describes how he passed through these stages of development before becoming the Enlightened One (M.i.16ff). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This sutta contains an account of the &quot;threefold lore&quot;(tisso vijjá) of the Buddha (see Sp.i.116) and praises of the Saraná (Refuges) (Sp.i.172).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Bhaddá Kapilání Therí&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The daughter of a Kosiyagotta Brahmin of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sagala')"&gt;Ságala&lt;/a&gt;, in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/madda')"&gt;Madda&lt;/a&gt; country. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ap.ii.583 (vs. 57) says that her mother was Sucímatí and her father &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kapila')"&gt;Kapila&lt;/a&gt;, whence, probably, her title of Kápilání. When the messengers sent by the parents of Pipphali-mánava (&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/maha_kassapa_th')"&gt;Mahá Kassapa&lt;/a&gt;) were wandering about seeking for a wife for him to resemble the image they carried with them, they discovered Bhaddá and informed Pipphali's parents. The parents arranged the marriage without the knowledge of the young people and Bhaddá went to Pipphali's house. There they lived together, but, by mutual consent, the marriage was never consummated. It was said that, she brought with her, on the day of her marriage, fifty thousand cartloads of wealth. When Pipphali desired to leave the world, making over to her his wealth, she wished to renounce it likewise, and together they left the house in the guise of recluses, their hair shorn, unobserved by any. In the village, however, they were recognized by their gait, and the people fell down at their feet. They granted freedom to all their slaves, and set forth, Pipphali leading and Bhaddá following close behind. On coming to a fork in the road, they agreed that he should take the right and she the left. In due course she came to the Titthiyáráma (near &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/j/jetavana')"&gt;Jetavana&lt;/a&gt;), where she dwelt for five years, women not having yet been admitted to the Buddha's Order. Later, when&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahapajapati_gotami')"&gt;Pajápatí Gotamí&lt;/a&gt; had obtained the necessary leave, Bhaddá joined her and received ordination, </data>
<data>attaining arahantship not long after. Later in the assembly, the Buddha declared her foremost of nuns who could recall former lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/padumuttara')"&gt;Padumuttara Buddha&lt;/a&gt; she was the wife of Videha, a setthi of Hamsavatí, and having heard a nun proclaimed in the first rank of those who could recall former lives, she resolved to acquire a similar rank, while her husband (Mahá Kassapa in this life) resolved to be chief among those who practise austere vows (dhutavádinam). Together they did many good deeds and were reborn in heaven.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/vipassii')"&gt;Vipassí Buddha&lt;/a&gt;, the husband was the brahmin Ekasátaka and she was his wife. In his next birth he was king of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/baranasi')"&gt;Benares&lt;/a&gt; and she his chief queen. Together they entertained eight Pacceka Buddhas on a very lavish scale. In the interval between the appearance in the world of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/konaagamana')"&gt;Konágamana&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kassapa')"&gt;Kassapa Buddha&lt;/a&gt;, the husband was a clansman and she his wife. One day a quarrel arose between her and her sister-in law. The latter gave alms to a Pacceka Buddha and Bhaddá, thinking &quot;She will win glory for this,&quot; took the bowl from her hand and filled it with mud. But later she was filled with remorse, took back the bowl, emptied it, scrubbed it with scented powder and, having filled it with the four sweet foods, sprinkled over the top ghee of the colour of a lotus calyx. Handing it back to the Pacceka Buddha, she prayed to herself &quot;May I have a shining body like this offering.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a later birth, Bhaddá was born as the daughter of a wealthy treasurer of Benares; she was given in marriage, but her body was of such evil odour that she was repulsive to all and was abandoned by several </data>
<data>husbands. Much troubled, she had her ornaments made into an ingot of gold and placed it on the shrine of Kassapa Buddha, which was in process of being built, and did reverence to it with her hands full of lotuses. Her body immediately became fragrant and sweet, and she was married again to her first husband. The Apadána account mentions two other lives: one when she was the wife of Sumitta and gave a blanket to a Pacceka Buddha, and again when she was born among the Koliyans and attended on one hundred Pacceka Buddhas of Koliya. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later, she was the queen of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/n/nanda')"&gt;Nanda&lt;/a&gt;, king of Benares (Brahmadatta, according to the Apadána, which gives King Nanda as the name of her husband in another life), with whom she ministered to five hundred Pacceka Buddhas, sons of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/padumavati')"&gt;Padumavatí&lt;/a&gt;. When they passed away she was greatly troubled and left the world to give herself up to ascetic practices. She dwelt in a grove, developed &lt;a href="http://www.palikanon.com/english/wtb/g_m/jhaana')"&gt;jhána&lt;/a&gt;, and was reborn in the Brahma world. (ThigA.67ff.; Ap.ii.578ff.; AA.ii.93ff., 203f.; A.i.25; Thig.vs.63-6).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bhaddá Kápilání's name is mentioned several times (e.g., Vin.iv.227, 268, 269, etc.) in the Vinaya rules in connection with her pupils who were found guilty of transgressing them. She and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/t/thulla_nandaa')"&gt;Thullanandá&lt;/a&gt; were both famous as preachers, and the latter, being jealous of Bhaddá, went out of her way to insult her (Vin.iv.290). Once Bhaddá sent word to Sáketa asking Thullanandá if she could find her a lodging in &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/saavatthi')"&gt;Sávatthi&lt;/a&gt;. Nandá agreed to do this, but made things very unpleasant for Bhaddá when she arrived. (Vin.iv.292)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bhaddá Kápilání is identified with the brahmin woman in </data>

On his deathbed, he asked his son to continue with the alms, and, after death, he was reborn as Sakka. His son followed him and became the god Canda. His son Suriya, Suriya's son Mátalí, and Mátalí's son Pañcasikha, all followed in the same path. But the sixth of the line, Bilárikosiya, became a miser and burnt the almonry. Sakka and the others then came separately, in the guise of brahmins, to visit him and to ask for alms. Kosiya refused their request until each one uttered a little verse, when he was asked to enter and receive a small gift. Kosiya asked the servant to give each a little unhusked rice. This was refused, and in the end he was obliged to give the brahmins cooked rice, meant for cows. Each swallowed a mouthful, but then let it stick in his throat and lay down as if dead. Kosiya, very frightened, had a meal prepared, which he put into their bowls, and then, calling in the passers by, asked them to note how the brahmins, in their greed, had eaten too much and died. But the brahmins arose, spat out the rice, and publicly shamed Kosiya by showing up his miserliness and the manner in which he had disgraced his ancestors. Then each revealed his identity and departed. Bilárikosiya mended his ways and became most generous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related to a monk reputed for his great generosity; he would not even drink a cup of water without sharing it. The monk is identified with Bilárikosiya, and the Buddha related the story in order to show how he had changed his ways. Sáriputta was Canda, Moggallána Suriya, Kassapa Mátalí and Ananda Pañcasikha.

The Buddha agreed with him, and he was so pleased with the Buddha's words that he asked to be ordained. The Buddha ordained him (S.i.170f ); the Commentary adds (SA.i.187ff), that he took the newly ordained to Pasenadi to whom he related what had happened. The king summoned the man's creditors; and paid them off, and having sent for his wife and daughters he took them under his protection.

Once a resident of Sávatthi invited the Buddha and all his monks to a meal and went from house to house asking the householders to share in the almsgiving. Bilálapádaka, annoyed at the request, gave only as much as could be grasped by three fingers -  hence his name -  (&quot;cat foot&quot;). The man took the gifts and added them to the others, but Bilálapádaka, suspecting that he might be disgraced in public, went to the almsgiving with a knife concealed on his person, ready to kill the man if he should mention his gift in ridicule. But he heard the man offer the alms to the Buddha, expressing the wish that all who had joined in the almsgiving should receive a rich reward. Moved by the man's largeness of heart, Bilálapáda fell at his feet, confessing his guilty intentions and begging for pardon. The Buddha thereupon preached to Bilálapáda, who, at the conclusion of the sermon, became a sotápanna. DhA.iii.17ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Bávarí was greatly distressed, but a devatá (his mother in a previous birth, AA.i.183), seeing his trouble, reassured him by saying that the brahmin knew neither the meaning of &quot;head&quot; nor of &quot;the splitting of it.&quot; &quot;Who then knows it?&quot; asked Bávarí, and the devatá told him of the appearance in the world of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddha')"&gt;Buddha&lt;/a&gt;.

For a problem arising out of the manner in which some of the marks were seen, see Mil.168f.; </data>
<data>DA.i.275f. This account is given in SN.vs.976 1148.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Commentary (SNA.603f), all Bávarí's disciples and their sixteen thousand followers whom they had gathered on their way, became arahants at the conclusion of the Buddha's sermon, save only Pingiya, Bávarí's nephew, who became an anágámí, because he had been thinking of Bávarí when the Buddha preached. Pingiya took leave of the Buddha and returned to Bávarí, to whom he recounted all these events. At the end of his recital, the Buddha appeared before them in a ray of glory and preached to them. Pingiya thereupon became an arahant and Bávarí an anágámí.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Kassapa Buddha, Bávarí was King Katthaváhana (q.v.). Hearing of the Buddha from his friend, the king of Benares, he sent messengers, including his nephew, to find out about the Buddha and to report to him. But the nephew returned with the news of the Buddha's death, which had taken place before their arrival at Benares. Thereupon, Katthaváhana, having accepted the Buddha's teaching, engaged in various good deeds and was reborn after death in the Kámávacara deva-world. From there he was born in the family of Pasenadi's chaplain and was the teacher of Pasenadi's boyhood. Unwilling to remain longer in the court, he took leave of the king and lived in the royal park as an ascetic. Then, wishing for greater peace, he retired to an island (antaradípa) in the Godhávarí where the two kings Assaka and Alaka gave him a tract of land, five leagues in extent, the residence of the sages of old. It was from there that he sent his disciples to the Buddha (SNA.575ff.; AA.i.182ff). At that time he was one hundred and twenty years old. Bávarí was the name of his gotta. He bore on his body three of the marks of a Great Being. SN.vs.1019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

A monk may wish to be free from the ásavas and from attachment, but his wish will be fruitless unless he develops the four satipatthánas, the four sammappadhánas, the four iddhi-pádas, the five indriyas, the five powers, the seven bojjhangas, and the Eightfold Noble Path. Without these he resembles one who waits for eggs to hatch out when there is no hen. But if the monk develops these qualities he will wear away the ásavas, etc., and be aware that they are worn away, like a carpenter who knows when the handle of his adze is worn away; all these things will weaken and rot away like a ship out of the water all the winter, exposed to wind and rain. A.iv.125f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Bhávaná Sutta&lt;/b&gt;. The four satipatthánas, if   cultivated, conduce to the state in which no further and no hither shore   exist. S.v.180.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Bhávaná Sutta&lt;/b&gt;. The cultivation of the four   satipatthánas consists in contemplation of body, feelings, mind, and mind   states. S.v.182.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Bhávaná Sutta&lt;/b&gt;. On psychic (iddhi ) power, its   basis, its cultivation, amid the practice which leads to its cultivation.

Bhágineyya Sangharakkhita Thera.&lt;/b&gt; He was the nephew of the Elder Sangharakkhita, hence his name. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once, at a certain monastery he was given two sets of robes, and immediately put away the better set to be given as a present to his uncle and teacher. At the end of the rains, he went to the monastery of his uncle, and, having waited upon him, offered his gift. But his uncle refused it in spite of the youth's repeated request. Thereupon the nephew became sulky, and while fanning the Elder, started to think what he could do if he became a layman. He would sell his robe, buy a she goat, get rich thereby, marry, and have a son. While taking the child out for a walk, he would ask to be allowed to carry him, his wife would refuse and carry him herself. Then she would drop the child and her husband would hit her. So thinking, in his absent-mindedness, the youth hit the Elder with the fan. The Elder read his thoughts and rebuked him. The youth then started to run away, but the monks caught him and brought him before the Buddha. The Buddha preached to him on the difficulty of keeping the mind in check. At the end of the sermon the youth became a sotápanna. DhA.i.300ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Bhágineyya Sangharakkhita&lt;/b&gt;. A novice who ate   hot food and burnt his tongue. His teacher warned him against such lack of   restraint, and the novice, developing insight on that topic, became an   arahant. Vsm., p. 45.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Bhágineyya Sangharakkhita&lt;/b&gt;. A monk who lived   in the Kotagerukapásada during his illness. His cell could accommodate just   one bed, yet the devas of two deva worlds, led by Sakka, were present there to   wait upon him. MT. 552.&lt;/p&gt;</data>

Near by was a man digging up lotus plants for their fibres, but to him the goddess said nothing. When questioned, her answer was that in a man like the Bodhisatta, seeking for purity, a sin even as large as a hair tip showed like a dark, cloud in the sky. The Bodhisatta, greatly impressed, thanked her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The goddess is identified with Uppalavanná.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to a monk who was upbraided by a deity in a forest tract in Kosala for smelling a lotus.

Chatta, the Kosala king's son, escaped, and became an ascetic near Takkasilá with a following of five hundred. Later he came with his followers to Benares, won the heart of the king by his demeanour, and lived in the royal park. There, by means of a spell, he discovered the buried treasure, and taking his followers into his confidence, took the treasure to Sávatthi and made the city impregnable. When Brahmadatta discovered his loss and its results, he was disconsolate, but was comforted by his minister, who was the Bodhisatta, and who pointed out to him that Chatta had but taken what belonged to him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to a knavish monk, identified with Chatta.

He did great good and was born as Sakka. The son squandered all his wealth in drinking and amusements and fell into poverty. Sakka took pity on him and gave him the Bhadraghata (Wishing Cup), asking him to take care of it. But one day, when the son was drunk, he threw the cup into the air and smashed it, thus reducing himself once again to misery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to a ne'er-do-well nephew of Anáthapindika. His uncle helped him again and again, but he squandered everything, and one day Anáthapindika had him turned out of his house. The two squanderers were the same.

The Buddha is said to have stayed there (D.ii.118;, Ud.vi.1; S.v.259). It was a pre Buddhist shrine and, according to the Commentaries (E.g., UdA.323; SA.ii.128, etc.), was a many branched nigrodha tree where persons prayed for sons to the deva of the tree. Hence its name.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/maha_kassapa_th')"&gt;Mahá Kassapa&lt;/a&gt; says that while yet a &quot;learner&quot; he paid homage to the Buddha at a Bahuputtaka-nigrodha where the Buddha had gone to meet him. The Buddha taught him of the training to be followed and, profiting by the lesson, eight days later Mahá Kassapa became an arahant. This nigrodha, however, was on the road from &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/r/raajagaha')"&gt;Rájagaha&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; to &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/n/naalandaa')"&gt;Nálandá&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; and was three leagues from Rájagaha*.

Bhalluka thereupon marched on Anurádhapura and pitched his camp at Kolambahálaka. Dutthagámani marched against him, and a battle took place in the precincts of the Mahávihára. Bhalluka shot an arrow at the king, and, believing that it had pierced his mouth, set up a great shout, but Phussadeva, who was seated on Kandula immediately behind the king, shot at Bhalluka, who thereupon fell dead prostrate at the feet of the king.

While they were going along with five hundred trading carts, these stopped near the Rájáyatana tree where the Buddha was sitting, eight weeks after his Enlightenment. When they investigated the cause for their carts thus stopping, a deity, their kinsman in a former life (their mother according to AA.i.207), pointed out to them the Buddha and asked them to give him a meal as he had eaten nothing for seven weeks. Not waiting to cook, the merchants gave the Buddha some butter and honey in a bowl provided by the Four Regent Gods. At the end of the meal the Buddha talked to them. They accepted the Buddha and the Dhamma as their Refuge (the Dvevácikasarana, they thus became the Buddha's first lay disciples; A.i.26), and obtained from the Buddha a few hairs as an object of worship. Later, when the Buddha was in &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/r/raajagaha')"&gt;Rájagaha&lt;/a&gt; after the preaching of his First Sermon, the merchants visited him and listened to his preaching. Tapassu became a sotápanna, and Bhallika entered the Order and became an arahant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past, Bhallika had given fruit to a Pacceka Buddha, named Sumana. During this life of Sikhí Buddha, he was a brahmin of Arunavatí, and hearing that Ujita and Ojita had given the Buddha his first meal, he and his friend invited the Buddha to eat at their house, and resolved to win a similar distinction for themselves in the future. They were herdsmen in the life of Kassapa Buddha, and for many years supplied milk rice to the Buddha and the monks (ThagA.i.48f.; AA.i.207f.; Vin.i.3f.; J.i.80. Mhv.iii.303f).&lt;/p&gt;</data>
<data>&lt;p&gt;The Theragáthá (vs.7), contains a verse spoken by Bhallika when Mára tried to frighten him by assuming a hideous form.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is said that the hair (eight handfuls) given by the Buddha was deposited in a cetiya in Asitañjana and that on fast days blue rays shone from the cetiya. AA.i.208. There is a tradition in Ceylon (recorded in the Pújávaliya) that Tapassu and Bhalluka visited the east coast of Ceylon and built a cetiya, there.

It was one of the four places of pilgrimage for the Buddhists -the others being &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kapilavatthu')"&gt;Kapilavatthu&lt;/a&gt;, Buddhagayá and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kusinaaraa')"&gt;Kusinára&lt;/a&gt; - because it was at, the Migadáya in &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/i_/isipatana')"&gt;Isipatana&lt;/a&gt; near Báránasí that the Buddha preached his first sermon to the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/pancavaggiya')"&gt;Pañcavaggiyá&lt;/a&gt; (D.ii.141). This was the spot at which all Buddhas set in motion the Wheel of the Law (Dhamma-cakka). It is the custom of Buddhas to travel by air from the Bodhi-tree to the scene of their first sermon, a distance of eighteen leagues (MA.i.388; Bu.A.242, etc.), but the present Buddha did all the journey on foot in order to be able to meet on the way the Ajívaka &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/upaka')"&gt;Upaka&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Benares was an important centre of trade and industry. There was direct trade between there and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/saavatthi')"&gt;Sávatthi&lt;/a&gt; (DhA.iii.429), the road passing through &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bhaddiya')"&gt;Bhaddiya&lt;/a&gt; (Vin.i.189), and between there and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/t/takkasilaa')"&gt;Takkasilá&lt;/a&gt; (DhA.i.123). It was the custom for enthusiastic young men of Benares to go to the university at Takkasilá (E.g., J.ii.4; DhA.i.250), but there seem to have been educational institutions at Benares also, some of which were older than even those of Takkasilá (KhA.198; see also DhA.iii.445, where&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/susiima')"&gt;Susíma&lt;/a&gt;, Sankha's son, goes from Takkasilá to Benares for purposes of study). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From Verañjá to Benares there seem to have been two routes: one rather circuitous, passing through Soreyya, and the other direct, </data>
<data>crossing the Ganges at Payágatittha. From Benares the road continued to Vesáli (Sp.i.201). On the road from Benares to Rájagaha was Andhakavinda (Vin.i.220). There seems to have been friendly intercourse between the chieftains of Benares and the kings of Magadha, as shown by the fact that Bimbisára sent his own physician, Jívaka, to attend to the son of the Treasurer of Benares (Vin.i.275). The distance from Kosambí to Benares was thirty leagues by river (MA.ii.929).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The extent of the city of Benares, including its suburbs, at the time when it was the capital of an independent kingdom, is often stated (E.g., J.iv.377; vi.160; MA.ii.608) to have been twelve leagues. The names of several kings are mentioned in the Játakas, among them being those of Anga, Uggasena, Udaya, Kikí, Dhanañjaya, Mahásílava, Vissasena, and Samyama. (The SNA. on the Khaggavisána Sutta contains the names of several kings of Benares who renounced the world and became Pacceka Buddhas). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The name which occurs most frequently, however, is that of Brahmadatta, which seems to have been the dynastic name of the Benares kings. In the Mahágovinda Sutta, the foundation of Báránasí is attributed to Mahágovinda, its first king being Dhatarattha, contemporary of Renu (D.ii.235). The Ceylon Chronicles (MT. 127,129,130) mention the names of others who reigned in Benares-  e.g., Duppasaha and sixty of his descendants; Asoka, son of Samankara, and eighty four thousand of his descendants; also sixteen kings, ancestors of Okkáka. The city itself had been known by different names at different periods; thus, in the time of the Udaya Játaka it was called Surundhana; in that of the Sutasoma, Sudassana; in that of the Sonananda, Brahmavaddhana; in that of the Khandahála, Pupphavatí; in that of the Yuvañjaya, Rammanagara (J.iv.119f); and in that of the Sankha, Moliní (J.iv.15). It was </data>
<data>also called Kásinagara and Kásipura (E.g., J.v.54; vi.165; DhA.i.87), being the capital of Kási. The Bhojájániya Játaka (J.i.178) says that &quot;all the kings around coveted the kingdom of Benares.&quot; In the Braháchatta Játaka (J.iii.116), the king of Benares is mentioned as having captured the whole of Kosala. At the time of the Buddha, however, Benares had lost its great political importance. Kosala was already the paramount power in India, and several successful invasions of Kási by the Kosalans under their kings Vanka, Dabbasena and Kamsa, are referred to. The final conquest would seem to be ascribed to Kamsa because the epithet Báránasíggha (conqueror of Benares) is an established addition to his name (J.ii.403).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later, when Ajátasattu succeeded in establishing his sway over Kosala, with the help of the Licchavis, Kásí, too, was included in his kingdom. Even in the Buddha's time the city of Benares was wealthy and prosperous and was included in the list of great cities suggested by Ananda as suitable places for the Parinibbána of the Buddha (D.ii.146).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mention is also made of a Bánárasísetthi (E.g., DhA.i.412; iii. 87, 365) and a Santhágárasálá (Mote Hall), which was then, however, no longer being used so much for the transaction of public business as for public discussions on religious and philosophical questions. E.g., J.iv.74; ascetics who came to the city found lodging for the night in the Potters' Hall (e.g., DhA.i.39). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Near Benares was a grove of seven sirísaka trees where the Buddha preached to the Nága king Erakapatta (DhA.iii.230), and also the Kemiyambavana where Udena met Ghotamukha (M.ii.158); on the other side of the river was Vásabhagáma, and beyond that another village called Cundatthila (PvA.168).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha is several times spoken of as staying in </data>
<data>Benares, where he preached several sermons (E.g., A.i.110f., 279f.; iii.392ff., 399ff.; S.i.105; v.406; Vin.i.189, 216f., 289) and converted many people including Yasa, whose home was in Benares (Vin.i.15), and his friends Vimala, Subáhu, Punnaji and Gavampati, all members of eminent families (Vin.i.19). Isipatana (q.v.) became a monastic centre in the Buddha's time and continued so for long after. From there came twelve thousand monks under the leadership of Dhammasena to be present at the ceremony of the foundation of the Mahá Thúpa (Mhv.xxix.31).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past, Báránasí was the birthplace of Kassapa Buddha (Bu.xxv.33). In the time of Metteyya Buddha, Báránasí will be known as Ketumatí at the head of eighty four thousand towns. Sankha will be Cakkavatti there, but he will renounce the world and will become an arahant under Metteyya (D.iii.75f). Báránasí evidently derives its name from the fact that it lies between the two rivers Barná and Asi (CAGI.499f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

One day, having left his cell in order to drive away his drowsiness, he fell as he was stepping on to the terrace, and, urged thereby to further effort, he accomplished self mastery and won arahantship. Later, when he was living in the bliss of fruition, the Buddha came to congratulate him on his solitude. Thag.vss.271-4; ThagA.i.380f.; cf. M.iii.155; Vin.i.350, ii.182; DhA.i.56, 133; J.i.140, iii.489; Mil.107.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is said (SA.ii.222; this sermon is referred to as the Kilesya Sutta) that, on this occasion, the Buddha, after his meal, preached to Bhagu for a whole day and a whole night. The next day Bhagu accompanied the Buddha on his alms round, and turned back when the Buddha proceeded to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/pacinavamsamigadaya')"&gt;Pácínavamsa-migadáya&lt;/a&gt; to see Anuruddha and the others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Padumuttara Buddha, Bhagu, was a householder, and, after the Buddha's death, offered flowers to his relics. As a result he was born among the Nimmánaratí gods (ThagA.i.380).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is probably identical with Játipupphiya of the Apadána (Ap.ii.405f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A monk named Bhagu is mentioned (Vin.i.300) as staying with Játipupphiya at the Kukkutáráma in Pátaliputta, but he is probably a different person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

They respected no one, and when they visited at a house where their conversation was not appreciated, they received one penny to go away. Once when the festival was being held in Sávatthi, the Buddha's followers requested him not to leave the monastery, and provided him and the monks with all requisites so that they did not have to go out.

At J.111.382 the potter's wife is addressed as &quot;Bhaggaví.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Samyutta Nikáya (S.i.36, 60) the Buddha addresses Ghatíkára Brahmá as &quot;Bhaggava&quot;; he had been a potter of Vehalinga in his previous birth and the name &quot;Ghatíkára&quot; itself means &quot;jar maker.&quot; The Commentaries give no explanation of the word; perhaps the potters claimed their descent from Bhrgu. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bhaggava is sometimes given as an example of a gotta. E.g., Sp.i.160 (with Gotama). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;See also &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bhaggavagotta')"&gt;Bhaggavagotta&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

While the king was absent, quelling a frontier rebellion, his queen sinned with all the messengers sent by the king to inquire after her welfare. On the day of the king's return, the chaplain, while decorating the palace, entered the queen's apartments, and she asked him to satisfy her lust. When he refused the queen (feigning illness) charged him with having ill treated her. Thereupon the king ordered that the chaplain be beheaded, but the latter begged to be brought before the king, where he protested his innocence and proved, by the testimony of the king's messengers, the queen's wickedness. The king wished to put to death the queen and all the messengers, but the chaplain interceded on their behalf and they were pardoned. He himself retired to the Himáya, where he became an ascetic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to the attempt of &lt;b&gt;Ciñcá&lt;/b&gt; to bring calumny upon the Buddha. The queen is identified with Ciññcá and the king with &lt;b&gt;Ananda&lt;/b&gt;. J.i.437ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Baka&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A Brahmá. When the Buddha was once staying at  &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/ukkatthaa')"&gt;Ukkatthá&lt;/a&gt; in the  &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/subhagavana')"&gt;Subhagavana&lt;/a&gt;, he read the thoughts of Baka, who had conceived the idea that this world was permanent and free from decay and death; and the Buddha visited him in order to point out his error. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Baka welcomed the Buddha but, owing to the influence of&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/maara')"&gt;Mára&lt;/a&gt;, refused to acknowledge his error, until the Buddha, by the exercise of his magical power, prevented Baka from disappearing from sight, while he himself dissolved into complete darkness. The Buddha then proceeded to tell him of four incidents connected with his previous birth as &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kesava')"&gt;Kesava&lt;/a&gt; (M.i.326ff.; S.i.142ff). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Baka was once born in a noble family, but he renounced the world and became an ascetic named Kesava. One day, seeing a caravan in distress in the desert, by his supernatural power he turned a river into the desert, thereby rescuing the members of the caravan. On another occasion, while staying on the banks of the river &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/e/enii')"&gt;Ení&lt;/a&gt;, near a frontier village, he found the village being attacked by dacoits, whom he drove away by causing them to see a vision of the royal police approaching, with himself at their head. On another day he saw people floating down the river in boats, making merry, singing and drinking. The Nága of the river, incensed at their behaviour, appeared before them, threatening destruction. Kesava, assuming the form of a Garuda, frightened the Nága away. The fourth incident is related in the&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kesava_jat_346')"&gt;Kesava Játaka&lt;/a&gt;. The Bodhisatta, known as &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kappa')"&gt;Kappa&lt;/a&gt;, was the pupil of Kesava. Kesava, practising </data>

While there he developed the third jhána and was born in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/subhakinna')"&gt;Subhakinha&lt;/a&gt; world. Thence he descended to the&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/aa/aabhassara')"&gt;Abhassara&lt;/a&gt; world, and, later, by practising the first jhána, he was reborn in the same world, but with a span of life of only a single kappa (J.iii.358 ff.; SA.i.164 f.; MA.i.553 ff). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;See also &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bakabrahma_sutta')"&gt;Bakabrahma Sutta&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Baka 2.&lt;/b&gt; The Bodhisatta, born as the king of Benares.

He was the child of a poor man of Rájagaha, and went one day with his father in a cart to the forest to collect firewood. By the time they returned to the town gate, evening had fallen. The cart was halted awhile, and the oxen, having got free from the yoke, entered the town. Telling the child to sit near the cart, the father set off after the oxen. Before he could return, the gate was shut, and the child owed his escape during the night from wild beasts and demons to his ñánavipphára-iddhi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the place where he slept was near to a cemetery, no evil spirit could harm the boy as that birth was destined to be his last. He later joined the Order and became an arahant, being famed as Bhútapála Thera. PSA. 493f.; Vsm.379f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2.

Baka Játaka (No.38)&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A crane, living near a pond, where the water dried up in summer, offered to carry the fish to a distant pond where water was plentiful. The fish, very suspicious, sent one of their numbers with the crane to verify his words, and when he returned with a favourable report, they accepted the crane's offer. One by one the fish were carried off and eaten by the crane, till only a crab was left. The wily crab agreed to go too, but he clung round the crane's neck while being carried along and cut off his head with his pincers when he discovered the crane's intentions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to a monk of Jetavana who was a clever robe maker. He could make robes of rags, which he dyed so skilfully that they looked new and costly. Visiting monks, on seeing them, would exchange their new robes for his old ones and not discover their folly till later. A similar robe maker lived in a hamlet at some distance from Jetavana, who, hearing of the Jetavana monk succeeded in cheating him. The monk was the crane and the hamlet dweller the crab of the story. J.i.220 ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;2.

A crane, who wished to eat them, stood on the bank of the pond with outstretched wings, gazing vacantly into space. The fish were impressed by his pious demeanour, but were warned against him by the Bodhisatta. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to a hypocrite who is identified with the crane.

One day, in a frontier village, a very rich landowner saw him, and, pleased with his appearance, brought him a very luxurious meal. The king took the food and passed it to his chaplain; the latter gave it to an ascetic who happened to be by. The ascetic placed it in the bowl of a Pacceka Buddha sitting near them. The Pacceka Buddha proceeded, without a word, to eat the meal. The landowner was astonished and asked them the reason for their action, and, on learning that each one was progressively greater in virtue than the king, he rejoiced greatly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to a landowner of Sávatthi, a devout follower of the Buddha. Being anxious to honour the Dhamma also, he consulted the Buddha, and, acting on his advice, invited Ananda to his house and gave him choice food and three costly robes. Ananda took them and offered them to Sáriputta, who, in his turn, made a gift of them to the Buddha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ananda was the king of the story, Sáriputta the chaplain, while the ascetic was the Bodhisatta.

An anágámí, one of seven   persons who became arahants as soon as they were born in Avihá. S.i.35, 60;   ThigA. 222, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Bhaddiya Thera. &lt;/b&gt;Called Káligodháputta, chief among monks of aristocratic birth (uccakulikánam) (A.i.23). He belonged to a family of the Sákyan rájas of Kapilavatthu and entered the Order in the Anupiya Mango grove with Anuruddha and the others, soon afterwards attaining to arahantship. Dwelling in the bliss of Nibbána, under a tree in a lonely spot, Bhaddiya used to exclaim &quot;Aho sukham, aho sukham.&quot; When this was reported to the Buddha, he questioned Bhaddiya, who answered that when he was ruling his principality he was well protected, yet was ever fearful and nervous, whereas now, having renounced all, he was free from all fear (Thag.vss.842-65; UdA.ii.10; Vin.i.183f.; J.i.140). This incident was the occasion for the preaching of the Sukhavihárí Játaka (q.v.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bhaddiya was the son of Káligodhá, the senior Sákyan lady of her time. For five hundred births Bhaddiya had been king, hence his eminence in this life, though there were others more aristocratic (AA.i.109). His resolve to gain this distinction was formed in the time of Padumuttara Buddha, when he was born in a very rich family and did various good deeds towards that end. In the interval between Kassapa Buddha and Gotama Buddha, he was a householder of Benares and, discovering that Pacceka Buddhas took their meals on the banks of the Ganges, placed seven stone planks for them to sit on (ThagA.ii.55f.; Ap.i.95f). When Bhaddiya was ruling his Sákyan principality he had as general Sona Potiriyaputta, who later joined the Order (ThagA.i.316). Anuruddha was Bhaddiya's great friend, and when Anuruddha wished to renounce the world, his </data>
<data>mother agreed only on condition that Bhaddiya should accompany him, hoping, in this way, to hold him back. But Anuruddha overcame all Bhaddiya's objections and persuaded him to renounce the household life within a week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is said (Vin.ii.182f) that Bhaddiya attained arahantship in the first rainy season after his ordination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a name="3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;. Bhaddiya. &lt;/b&gt;A city in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/anga')"&gt;Anga&lt;/a&gt; kingdom (DhA.i.384; also iii.363). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha visited there several times and stayed sometimes at the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/j/jaatiyaavana')"&gt;Játiyávana&lt;/a&gt; where &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/me_mu/mendaka')"&gt;Mendaka&lt;/a&gt;, who lived there, came to see him (Vin.ii.242; DhA.iii.363; also A.iii.36). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was there that the precept was laid down forbidding monks to wear sandals. Vin.i.190; DhA.iii.451f.; also another ruling re the Párájiká (Vin.iii.37f). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bhaddiya was also the residence of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bhaddaji_th')"&gt;Bhaddaji Thera&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/visaakhaa')"&gt;Visákhá&lt;/a&gt;. v.l.

Cv.lxxxi.6.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Bhuvanekabáhu.&lt;/b&gt; The younger son of Vijayabáhu   III. When Parakkamabáhu II. came to the throne, Bhuvanekabáhu was made   Yuvarája. By the king's orders he learnt the Tipitaka, in which he became well   versed, and later instructed the Theras therein. Cv.lxxxi.68; lxxxii.4;   lxxxiv.29. See also Bhuvanekabáhu-parivena.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Bhuvanekabáhu.&lt;/b&gt; The second of the five sons of Parakkamabáhu II. He was entrusted (by Vijayabáhu IV.) with the defence of the north of Ceylon with his headquarters at Sundarapabbata. He later built a town there where he settled. When Vijayabáhu died and Mitta usurped the throne, Bhuvanekabáhu fled from the capital (Jambuddoni) and narrowly escaped death on the way. But soon after, the Ariya soldiers revolted against Mitta and restored Bhuvanekabáhu to the throne, where he ruled for eleven years (1237-84 A.C.) as Bhuvanekabáhu I. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among other acts of piety, he appointed scribes to copy the whole of the Tipitaka, and gave copies to the chief viháras of Ceylon.

Ananda, overhearing the conversation, reports it to the Buddha, who says that both Pañcakanga and Udáyi are correct because he himself classified feelings in various ways; sensual pleasures might be pleasant, but are not the highest pleasures; far better and more excellent are the pleasures enjoyed by a monk who develops the four jhánas, the plane of infinity of consciousness and the plane of nought. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;M.i.396ff.; the Sutta is repeated at S.iv.223ff., under the name of Pañcakanga Sutta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Bráhmana Sutta.&lt;/b&gt; The brahmin Unnábha visits Ananda at the Ghositáráma and questions him. Ananda tells him that the life of a recluse has for its object the abandonment of desire and that this is brought about by the cultivation of the four iddhi&lt;span lang="en-us"&gt;-pádas.

<data>is infinite, and that both teachers claim omniscience. How can one know which teaching is true? The Buddha dismisses their question and teaches them that it is not by trying to walk to the end of the world that the end of the world can be reached, but by understanding the five strands of sense-desire (kámaguna). This can be accomplished by the cultivation of the jhánas. A.iv.428f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

For three months he avoided the Buddha, until, just before the Buddha was starting on a journey, Bhaddáli, acting on the advice of his fellow monks, confessed his fault to the Buddha and begged for forgiveness (M.i.437ff). The Buddha praised this action and preached to him the Bhaddáli Sutta (q.v.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is said (MA.ii.648) that, in a previous birth, Bhaddáli had been a crow, therefore in this life he was always hungry and was known among his fellows as the Great Eater (Maháchátaka).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thirty kappas ago he met Sumedha Buddha in the forest, wrapt in meditation, and, having tidied the place where the Buddha was sitting, he erected over him a pavilion.

Desirous of eating venison cooked on charcoal, he gave the kingdom in charge of his courtiers and went to the Himálaya on a hunting expedition. While wandering about near Gandhamádana, among pleasant streams and groves, he came across two kinnaras fondly embracing each other and then weeping and wailing most pitifully. The king quieted his hounds, laid down his weapons, and approached the kinnaras. In answer to his questions, the female told him that one day, while she was picking flowers on the opposite bank for a garland for her lover, it grew late and a storm arose. The stream which separated the two lovers swelled in flood and they had to spend the night apart from each other. The memory of one night, thus passed in separation, had filled them with sorrow for six hundred and ninety seven years, and they still wept whenever they thought of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to a quarrel between &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/pasenadi')"&gt;Pasenadi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/mallikaa')"&gt;Malliká&lt;/a&gt; about conjugal rights.

Uttara therefore visited the Buddha and, having seen the thirty two marks, resolved to observe the Buddha in his every posture and, to this end, followed him about for seven months. He then returned to Brahmáyu and told him of the result of his investigations. Brahmáyu folded his palms reverently and uttered the praises of the Buddha. Soon after, the Buddha came to Mithilá and took up his residence in the Makhádeva ambavana. Brahmáyu, having sent a messenger to announce his arrival, visited the Buddha. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is said that all those present rose to greet him, but Brahmáyu signed to them to be seated. He satisfied any remaining doubts he had as to the marks on the Buddha's body and then proceeded to ask him questions on various topics. At the end of the discussion he fell at the Buddha's feet, stroking them and proclaiming his name. The Buddha asked him to compose himself, and preached to him on &quot;progressive&quot; discourse. Brahmáyu invited the Buddha and his monks to his house, where he entertained them for a week. His death occurred not long after, and the Buddha, when told of it, said that Brahmáyu had become an Anágámí (M.ii.133ff). Brahmáyu's salutation of the Buddha is described as panipáta.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Bhaddavággiyá&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A group of thirty young men, converted by the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddha')"&gt;Buddha&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They had gone picnicking with their wives in a forest glade between &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/baranasi')"&gt;Báránasi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/uruvelaa')"&gt;Uruvelá&lt;/a&gt;. One of them had no wife, and for him they found a courtesan; but she awaited the opportunity and ran away with their goods. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While seeking for her, they saw the Buddha and enquired if he had seen a woman. But he answered, should they not rather seek the &quot;self&quot; than a woman. They all agreed thereto, and he preached to them. At the end of the sermon they realized the Truth and were ordained (Vin.i.23f.; DhA.ii.33f). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their conversion was one of the subjects sculptured in the Relic Chamber of the Mahá Thúpa.

Bodhi&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He lived at &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/sumsumaaragiri')"&gt;Sumsumáragiri&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bhagga')"&gt;Bhagga&lt;/a&gt; country and built a palace called &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kokanada')"&gt;Kokanada&lt;/a&gt;. When the palace was completed, the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddha')"&gt;Buddha&lt;/a&gt; was staying at &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bhesakalavava')"&gt;Bhesakalávana&lt;/a&gt; near by, and Bodhi sent a message by &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sanjikaputta')"&gt;Sañjikáputta&lt;/a&gt;, inviting the Buddha to the palace, that he might bless it by being its first occupant. The Buddha agreed to come and, the next day, arrived with the monks for a meal. Bodhi came, with his retinue, to meet them at the foot of the steps and asked the Buddha to step on to the carpeting which was spread there. Three times the request was made, three times the Buddha kept silence. Thereupon &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/aa/aananda')"&gt;Ananda&lt;/a&gt; asked for the carpeting to be removed, saying that the Buddha's refusal to step thereon was as an example to future generations. After the meal, Bodhi had a discussion with the Buddha (Vin.ii.127f.; M.ii.91ff), recorded in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bodhirajakumara_s')"&gt;Bodhirájakumára Sutta&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commentary adds (MA.ii.739ff) that one of the reasons for the Buddha's refusal to step on the carpet was that he knew the thoughts of Bodhi. Bodhi was saying to himself: &quot;If I am to have a son, the Buddha will step on this carpet, if not, he will not.&quot; The Buddha knew also that Bodhi was not destined to have a son because in a previous life he and his wife had lived on an island and eaten young birds. DhA.iii.137ff adds that the Buddha actually told Bodhi of the non fulfillment of his wish for a son, and related to him the </data>
<data>story of his past life in which he and his wife ate birds' eggs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bodhi was the son of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/udena')"&gt;Udena&lt;/a&gt;, king of&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kosambii')"&gt;Kosambi&lt;/a&gt;, and his mother was the daughter of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/cannda_ppajjota')"&gt;Candappajjota&lt;/a&gt;. Bodhi was skilled in the art of managing elephants (see also M.ii.94), which art he learned from his father, a master in this direction. It is said (M.ii.97)  that, while Bodhi was yet in his mother's womb, she visited the Buddha at the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/g/ghositaaraama')"&gt;Ghositáráma&lt;/a&gt; in Kosambí and declared that whatever child was born to her it would accept the Buddha, his teaching and the Order, as its abiding refuge. Later, after Bodhi's birth, his nurse took him to the Buddha at Bhesakalávana and made a similar declaration. When, therefore, Bodhi acknowledged the Buddha as his teacher, at the conclusion of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bodhirajakumara_s')"&gt;Bodhirájakumára Sutta&lt;/a&gt;, he was seeking the Buddha's refuge for the third time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some accounts* of the building of Bodhi's palace add that as it was being completed, Bodhi conceived the idea of killing the architect or of blinding him so that he could never design a similar house for anyone else. He confided this idea to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sanjikaputta')"&gt;Sanjikáputta&lt;/a&gt;, who warned the architect. The latter, therefore, obtained special timber from Bodhi, saying it was for the palace, and made out of it a wooden bird large enough to hold himself and his family. When it was ready, he made it fly out of the window, and he and his family escaped to the Himálaya country, where he founded a kingdom and came to be known as King &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/katthavaahana')"&gt;Katthaváhana&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;* E.g., DhA.iii.134ff.; in J.iii.157 it is stated </data>
<data>  briefly that Bodhi did actually blind the architect. In a previous birth he   put out the eyes of one thousand warriors.

While meditating in a forest tract in Kosala, he grew slothful and rough in speech. One day the Buddha, seeing his maturing insight, appeared before him in a ray of glory and admonished him with averse. Belatthánika was filled with agitation and soon after became an arahant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Vipassí Buddha he was a brahmin teacher, and, while wandering about with his pupils, he saw the Buddha and offered him seven flowers. Twenty nine kappas ago he became king under the name of Vipulábhása (Thag.vs.101; ThagA.i.205f). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is probably identical with Campakapupphiya of the Apadána.

She could travel fifteen leagues in a day (DhA.i.196). Udena made use of her in his elopement with Vásuladattá (DhA.i.198). At first the king paid her great honour, declaring that his life, queen and kingdom were all due to her; her stall was smeared with perfumed earth and hung with coloured hangings, a lamp burned perfumed oil and a dish of incense was set on one side. She stood on a coloured carpet and ate royal food of many flavours. But when she grew old she was neglected and became destitute. One day she saw the Buddha entering the city for alms, fell at his feet, and complained of the king's neglect. The Buddha reported the matter to the notice of Udena, and all former honours were restored to Bhaddavatí. This incident led to the preaching of the Dalhadhamma Játaka.

One day he heard a brahmin soothsayer announce that if a brigand were to commence his activities under a certain combination of planets, he would conquer the whole of Ceylon. Tissa, acting on this idea, turned robber and sent word to the king that he should hand over his throne to him. At the same time seven Damilas, with their followers, arrived in Mahátittha with the same demand. The king thereupon sent word to Tissa that the kingdom would be his if he could defeat the Damilas. Tissa agreed to this and marched against them, but was taken captive in a battle near Sanketahála. The Páli Commentaries give further details. Tissa plundered the land for twelve long years; food became so scarce that, owing to starvation, people lost even their sexual desires, and the birth of a child was such a rare occurrence that all the land rejoiced over such a birth (SA.ii.83). Tissa's activities were at their height when Vattagámaní was in hiding. The stores of food in Cittalapabbata vihára and in Tissamaháráma were laid waste by enormous rats and the monks could obtain no food, Tissa having ravished the land. They therefore sent eight Theras to Sakka, begging him to rid the country of Tissa; but Sakka sent reply that he was powerless, and suggested that the monks should go over the seas. Some took his advice and sailed from Jambukola, but the </data>
<data>leaders of the community &lt;span lang="en-us"&gt;-  Samyuttabhánaka Cúlasíva, Isidatta and Mahásona &lt;span lang="en-us"&gt;-  remained behind awaiting better times (see also Nágá Therí, whose story given in AA.ii.654f.; also MA.i.546). The Mahávihára at Anurádhapura was deserted; the Mahá Thúpa was overgrown with trees. The monks had to live on lotus stalks and fruit rinds thrown away by the people. When Bráhmanatissa died, Vattagámaní once more came to the throne (VibhA.445&lt;span lang="en-us"&gt;-51). v.l. Bráhmanatiya cora (from which the Ceylon Chronicles derive the form Báminitiyá).

He was conceived after Sudinna had already been ordained. His wife came to him during her period and begged him to give her an offspring (bíjaka). As the rule against unchastity had not then been promulgated, Sudinna yielded to her importunities, thus becoming guilty of the first Párájiká. The son was called Bíjaka, and so Sudinna came to be called Bíjakapitá and the mother Bíjakamátá. Both Bíjaka and his mother later left the world and became arahants.

Bíjaka also agreed that Guna's teaching accorded with his own experience. He remembered his previous life, when he had been born as Bhávasetthi of Sáketa and had done many acts of virtue and piety. But at present he was the son of a poor prostitute leading a wretched life. Even so, he always gave half his food to any who might desire it, kept the fast, and led, in every way, a virtuous life. But virtue, he said, was useless; it bore no fruit. So saying, he wept. When Rujá (q.v.) heard this, she said that Bíjaka's sufferings were due to evil actions done in the past in earlier lives (J.vi.227, 228, 229, 233, 235). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scholiast explains (J.vi.228) that in the time of Kassapa Buddha, while Bíjaka was seeking a lost ox, a monk enquired of him the way which he had lost. Bíjaka was angry and abused the monk, calling him a slave. His birth as Bhávasetthi was due to some earlier good done by him, but in </data>
<data>this birth he became a slave. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bíjaka is identified with Moggallána (J.vi.225).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

He was born in the family of a householder of Báhiya (Ap.ii.476 says he was born in Bhárukaccha) -  hence his name - and engaged himself in trade, voyaging in a ship. Seven times he sailed down the Indus and across the sea and returned safely home. On the eighth occasion, while on his way to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/suvannabhuumi')"&gt;Suvannabhúmi&lt;/a&gt;, his ship was wrecked, and he floated ashore on a plank, reaching land near &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/suppara')"&gt;Suppáraka&lt;/a&gt;. Having lost all his clothes, he made himself a bark garment, and went about, bowl in hand, for alms in Suppáraka. Men, seeing his garment and struck with his demeanour, paid him great honour. Though they offered him costly robes and many other luxuries, he refused them all and his fame increased. Because of his bark garment he was known as Dárucíriya. In due course he came himself to believe that he had attained arahantship, but a devatá (a Suddhávása-brahmá, who had been his fellow celibate in the time of Kassapa Buddha, says the Commentary, see below and also MA.i.340), reading his thoughts and wishing him well, pointed out to him his error and advised him to seek the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddha')"&gt;Buddha&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/saavatthi')"&gt;Sávatthi&lt;/a&gt;. By the power of the devatá, Báhiya reached Sávatthi in one night, a distance of one hundred and twenty leagues, and was told that the Buddha was in the city begging alms. Báhiya followed him thither and begged to be taught something for his salvation. Twice he asked and twice the Buddha refused, saying that it was not the hour for teaching. But Báhiya insisted, saying that life was uncertain and that the Buddha or he might die. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commentaries say that Báhiya was excited by his </data>
<data>meeting with the Buddha and that the Buddha wished to give him time to regain his calm, hence his refusal. The Buddha knew of his impending death and of his upanissaya for arahantship. He was a pacchimabhavika.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha then taught him the proper method of regarding all sense experiences -  namely, as experiences and no more. Even as he listened, Báhiya became an &lt;a href="http://www.palikanon.com/english/wtb/a/ariya_puggala')"&gt;arahant&lt;/a&gt; and the Buddha left him. Shortly after, Báhiya was gored to death by a cow with calf (cp. the story of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pu/pukkusati')"&gt;Pukkusáti&lt;/a&gt;). The Buddha, seeing his body lying on the dung heap, asked the monks to remove it and to have it burnt, erecting a thúpa over the remains. In the assembly he declared Báhiya to be foremost among those who instantly comprehended the Truth (khippábhiññánam) (A.i.24; Ud.i.10).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Báhiya's resolve to attain to this eminence was made in the time of Padumuttara Buddha when he heard the Buddha declare a monk foremost in instantaneous comprehension. In the time of Kassapa Buddha, when the Buddha's teachings were fading from the minds of men, Báhiya was one of seven monks who climbed a rock, determined not to leave it until they had attained their goal. Their leader became an arahant and the second an anágámí -  passing into the Suddhávása world; the rest were reborn in this age as Pukkusáti, Kumára Kassapa, Dabba-Mallaputta, Sabhiya and Báhiya. Although Báhiya had kept the precepts in previous births, he had never given a bowl or a robe to a monk. For this reason the Buddha did not, at the end of his sermon, ordain him by the &quot;ehi bhikkhu pabbajá.&quot; The Buddha knew that Báhiya had not sufficient merit to obtain divine robes. Some say that he was once a brigand and had shot a Pacceka Buddha with an arrow and had taken possession of the Pacceka Buddha's begging </data>
<data>bowl and robe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Báhiya met his death while searching for a robe in which to be ordained (UdA.77ff.; AA.i.156ff.; DhA.ii.209ff.; Ap.ii.475ff). The cow, which killed Báhiya was identical with the one which killed &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pu/pukkusati')"&gt;Pukkusáti&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/t/tambadaathika')"&gt;Tambadáthika&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/suppabuddha')"&gt;Suppabuddha&lt;/a&gt; (for her story see DhA.ii.35f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Báhiya. &lt;/b&gt;A Damila usurper who reigned in Anurádhapura for two years (between 43 and 29 B.C.). He was commander in chief of Pulahattha whom he slew, being himself, in turn, slain by his own commander in chief, Panayamára. Mhv.xxxiii.56ff.; Dpv.xx.15.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Báhiya. &lt;/b&gt;A monk. He is said to have, come to the Buddha asking for a teaching in brief and the Buddha told him to dwell on the impermanence of the senses and of sense objects. Profiting by the lesson, Báhiya dwelt apart and, putting forth effort, soon became an arahant (S.iv.63f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is perhaps the same monk -  called Báhiya or Báhika -  who is mentioned elsewhere (S.v.165f) as asking for the Buddha for a lesson and being told to meditate on the four satipatthánas. This contemplation led to arahantship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Báhiya. &lt;/b&gt;A monk, fellow dweller of Anuruddha at the Ghositáráma. He seems to have taken a prominent part in the disputes of the Kosambí monks, helping them, but Anuruddha let him take his own way, not protesting at all. A.ii.239; cf. KhA.115.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;5. Báhiya, Báhika.&lt;/b&gt; The name of a country, residence of Bharata, the hunter mentioned in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/atthasadda_jat')"&gt;Atthasadda Játaka&lt;/a&gt; (J.iii.432).

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Bodhirukka&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The generic name given to the tree under which a Buddha attains Enlightenment (D.A.ii.416). The tree is different in the case of each Buddha. Thus, &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;for Gotama and also for Kondañña it was an asvattha;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;for Dípankara a sirísa; &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;for Mangala, Sumana, Revata and Sobhita a nága;   &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;for Anomadassí an ajjuna; &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;for Paduma and Nárada a mahásona; &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;for Padumuttara a salala; &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;for Sumedha a nimba; &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;for Sujáta a bamboo; &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;for Piyadassí a kakudha; &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;for Atthadassí a campaka; &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;for Dhammadassí a bimbajála; &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;for Siddhattha a kanikára; &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;for Tissa an asana; &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;for Phussa an ámanda; &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;for Vipassí a pátalí; &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;for Sikhí a pundaríka; &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;for Vessabhú a sála; &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;for Kakusandha a sirísa; &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;for Konágamma an udumbara; &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;for Kassapa a banyan (see passim; the details differ   some what at BuA.247). &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The site of the Bodhi tree is the same for all Buddhas (BuA.247), and it forms the navel of the earth (J.iv.233) (puthuvinábhi). No other place can support the weight of the Buddha's attainment. J.iv.229.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When no Bodhi tree grows, the Bodhimanda (ground round the Bodhi&lt;span lang="en-us"&gt;-tree), for a distance of one royal karísa, is devoid of all plants, even of any blade of grass, and is quite smooth, spread with sand like a silver plate, while all around it are grass, creepers and trees. None can travel in the air immediately above it, not </data>
<data>even Sakka (J.iv.232f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the world is destroyed at the end of a kappa, the Bodhimanda is the last spot to disappear; when the world emerges into existence again, it is the first to appear. A lotus springs there bringing it into view and if during the kappa thus begun a Buddha will be born, the lotus puts forth flowers, according to the number of Buddhas (DA.ii.412).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the case of Gotama Buddha, his Bodhi tree sprang up on the day he was born (DA.ii.425; BuA.248). After his Enlightenment, he spent a whole week in front of it, standing with unblinking eyes, gazing at it with gratitude. A shrine was later erected on the spot where he so stood, and was called the Animisalocana cetiya (q.v.). The spot was used as a shrine even in the lifetime of the Buddha, the only shrine that could be so used. While the Buddha was yet alive, in order that people might make their offerings in the name of the Buddha when he was away on pilgrimage, he sanctioned the planting of a seed from the Bodhi tree in Gayá in front of the gateway of Jetavana. For this purpose Moggallána took a fruit from a tree at Gayá as it dropped from its stalk, before it reached the ground. It was planted in a golden jar by Anáthapindika with great pomp and ceremony. A sapling immediately sprouted forth, fifty cubits high, and in order to consecrate it the Buddha spent one night under it, wrapt in meditation. This tree, because it was planted under the direction of Ananda, came to be known as the Ananda Bodhi (J.iv.228ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Ceylon Chronicles (e.g., Mhv.xv), branches from the Bodhi trees of all the Buddhas born during this kappa were planted in Ceylon on the spot where the sacred Bodhi tree stands today in Anurádhapura. The branch of Kakusandha's tree was brought by a nun called Rucánandá, Konagamana's by Kantakánandá (or Kanakadattá), and Kassapa's by </data>
<data>Sudhammá. Asoka was most diligent in paying homage to the Bodhi tree, and held a festival every year in its honour in the month of Kattika (Mhv.xvii.17). His queen, Tissarakkhá was jealous of the Tree, and three years after she became queen (i.e., in the nineteenth year of Asoka's reign), she caused the tree to be killed by means of mandu thorns (Mhv.xx.4f). The tree, however, grew again, and a great monastery was attached to the Bodhimanda. Among those present at the foundation of the Mahá Thúpa are mentioned thirty thousand monks, from this Vihára, led by Cittagutta (Mhv.xxix.41).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kittisirimegha of Ceylon, contemporary of Samudragupta, erected with the permission of Samudragupta, a Sangháráma near the Mahábodhi-vihára, chiefly for the use of the Singhalese monks who went to worship the Bodhi tree. The circumstances in connection with the Sangháráma are given by Hiouen Thsang (Beal, op. cit., 133ff) who gives a description of it as seen by himself. It was probably here that Buddhaghosa met the Elder Revata who persuaded him to come to Ceylon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the twelfth year of Asoka's reign the right branch of the Bodhi tree was brought by Sanghamittá to Anurádhapura and placed by Devánámpiyatissa in the Mahámeghavana. The Buddha, on his death bed, had resolved five things, one being that the branch which should be taken to Ceylon should detach itself (Mhv.xvii.46f). From Gayá, the branch was taken to Pátaliputta, thence to Támalittí, where it was placed in a ship and taken to Jambukola, across the sea; finally it arrived at Anurádhapura, staying on the way at Tivakka. Those who assisted the king at the ceremony of the planting of the Tree were the nobles of Kájaragáma and of Candanagáma and of Tivakka. From the seeds of a fruit which grew on the tree sprang eight saplings, which were planted respectively &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;</data>
<data>  &lt;li&gt;at Jambukola, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;in the village of Tivakka, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;at Thúpárámá, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;at Issaramanáráma, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;in the court of the Pathamacetiya, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;in Cetiyagiri, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;in Kájaragáma and &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;in Candanagáma (Mhv.xix.60ff.; for details in   connection with the bringing of the Bodhitree, see Mbv.144 ff). &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thirty-two other saplings, from four other fruits, were planted here and there at a distance of one yojana. Ceremonies were instituted in honour of the Tree, the supervision of which was given over to Bodháhárakula, at the head of which were the eight ministers of Asoka who, led by Bodhigutta and Sumitta (see Mbv.165f., for the names of the others), were sent as escorts of the Tree. Revenues were provided for these celebrations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later, King Dhátusena built a Bodhighara or roof over the Tree (Cv.xxxviii.431) while Silákála made daily offerings at the shrine (see Cv.Trs.i.32, n. 6; Cv.xli.29), and Kittisirimegha had the Bodhighara covered with tin plates (Cv.xli.65). Mahánága had the roof of the Bodhighara gilded, built a trench round the courtyard and set up Buddha images in the image house (Cv.xli.94). Aggabodhi I. erected a stone terrace round the Tree and placed, at the bottom of it, an oil pit to receive the oil for illuminations on festival days (Cv.xlii.19). Aggabodhi II. had a well dug for the use of pilgrims (Cv.xlii.66), and Moggallána III. held a great celebration in the Tree's honour (Cv.xliv.45). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aggabodhi VII found the Bodhighara in ruins and had it rebuilt (Cv.xlviii.70); Mahinda II instituted a regular offering in its honour (Cv.xlviii.124), and Udaya III gave a village near Anurádhapura to the service of the Bodhi tree.

She was foremost among nuns, of swift intuition, and was born in the family of a treasurer of Rájagaha. On the same day, a son was born to the king's chaplain under a constellation favourable to highwaymen, and was therefore called &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sattuka')"&gt;Sattuka&lt;/a&gt;. One day, through her lattice, Bhaddá saw Sattuka being led by the city guard to execution on a charge of robbery. She fell at once in love with him and refused to live without him. Her father, out of his love for her, bribed the guard to release Sattuka, let him be bathed in perfumed water, and brought him home, where Bhaddá, decked in jewels, waited upon him. Very soon, Sattuka began to covet her jewels and told her that he had made a vow to the deity of the Robbers' Cliff that, should he escape, he would bring him an offering. She trusted him and, making ready an offering, went with him arrayed in all her ornaments. On arriving at the top of the cliff, he told her of his purpose, and she, all undaunted, begged of him to let her embrace him on all sides. He agreed to this, and then, making as if to embrace him from the back, she pushed him over the cliff. The deity of the mountain praised her presence of mind saying that men were not in all cases wiser than women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unwilling to return home after what had happened; she joined the Order of the white robed Niganthas. As she wished to practise extreme austerities, they dragged out her hair with a palmyra comb. Her hair grew again in close curls, and so they called her Kundala-kesá (&quot;Curly-hair&quot;). Dissatisfied with the teaching of the Niganthas, she left them, and going to various teachers, became very, proficient in discussion and eager for debate. She would enter a village and, making a heap of sand at the gate, set up the </data>
<data>branch of a rose apple saying, &quot;Whoever wishes to enter into discussion with me, let him trample on this bough.&quot; One day, Sáriputta, seeing the bough outside Sávatthi, ordered some children to trample on it. Bhaddá then went to Jetavana accompanied by a large crowd whom she had invited to be present at the discussion. Sáriputta suggested that Bhaddá should first ask him questions; to all of these he replied until she fell silent. It was then his turn, and he asked &quot;One what is that?&quot; (probably meaning: &quot;state any one fact true for everyone&quot;)  She, unable to answer, asked him to be her teacher. But Sáriputta sent her to the Buddha, who preached to her that it were better to know one single stanza bringing calm and peace than one thousand verses bringing no profit. At the end of this sermon, Bhaddá attained arahantship, and the Buddha himself ordained her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Padumuttara Buddha, she had heard him preach and place as foremost among nuns one whose intuition was swift (khippábhiññá). She vowed that this rank should one day be hers. Later, when Kassapa was Buddha, she was one of the seven daughters of Kikí, king of Benares, and was named Bhikkhadáyiká (v.l. Bhikkhudásiká). For twenty thousand years she remained celibate and built a dwelling for the Order. A.i.25; AA.i.200ff.; ThigA.99ff.; Ap.ii.560ff. The DhA. Account (ii. 217 ff.) differs in various details. There Bhaddá is shut up by her parents at the top of a seven storied building with only a single woman to wait on her, for &quot;girls when young, burn for men!&quot; It was thus that she saw the robber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Therígáthá (Thig.vss.107-11) are included several verses spoken by her when she had been a nun for fifty years, wandering about in Anga, Magadha, Kási and Kosala, living on the people's alms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

King Bimbisára, having heard of her beauty, expressed to his purohita a wish to see her. The purohita, by the power of his spells, enlisted the assistance of a Yakkha, Kumbhíra, who took the king to Ujjeni. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She bore to the king a son, Abhayarájakumára, who later joined the Order and became an arahant. It was on his account that Padumavatí came to be called Abhayamátá. She heard Abhayarájakumára preach and leaving the world herself became an arahant (ThigA.31-2). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two verses attributed to her are found in the Therigatha (33,34). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of the Buddha Tissa, seeing him going round for alms, with glad heart she gave him a spoonful of food.

When the Buddha was on tour near there he was repeatedly warned by the cowherds not to go to Ambatittha as in the Jatila's hermitage in the village dwelt a mighty Nága. While the Buddha was yet in Bhaddavatiká the Elder Ságata went to the Jatila's hermitage and took up his abode near the fireplace. The Nága showed his resentment, but Ságata was able to overcome him by means of his iddhi-powers. Later Ságata visited the Buddha at Bhaddavatiká and went with him to Kosambí. The fame of the Elder's victory over the Nága had preceded him and the inhabitants of Kosambí were lavish in their hospitality to him. He drank wine in their houses and had to be carried to see the Buddha. The latter made this the occasion for declaring the drinking of intoxicants to be a pácittiya-offence.

The four &lt;a href="http://www.palikanon.com/english/wtb/s_t/satipatthaana')"&gt;satipattháná&lt;/a&gt; form the sole way that leads to the purification of beings, and to the realisation of Nibbana, etc. S.v.140.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Ambapáli Sutta.&lt;/b&gt;-A conversation between Anuruddha and Sáriputta in Ambálivana. Sáriputta asks the reason of Anuruddha's serenity and beauty of complexion. It is due to the practice of the four &lt;a href="http://www.palikanon.com/english/wtb/s_t/satipatthaana')"&gt;satipattháná&lt;/a&gt;, says Anuruddha; he himself spends all his time in the practice of them, and so generally do all arahants.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Ajagara&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A peta who lived in Gijjhakúta. He was seen there by Mogallána, but not by Moggallána's companion Lakkhana Thera. Later, in answer to a question by Lakkhana Thera, the Buddha revealed the peta's past. He had been a bandit in Kassapa Buddha's time, and having been unintentionally offended by the treasurer Sumangala, who had built a Gandhakuti for Kassapa, he sought to take revenge on him and to make him angry by committing various heinous crimes against him. But the latter showed no wrath, and once, after having given aims to the Buddha, he gave over the merit, so gained, to the bandit. He thereupon repented, but his evil kamma was too great for him to be able to win any special attainment. DhA.iii.60ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Ambatthala&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A little tableland immediately below the Silakúta of the Missaka Mountain in Ceylon. It was near here that Mahinda and his companions alighted after their aerial journey from Jambudípa (Mhv.xiii.20). There King Mahádáthika-Mahánága built the Ambatthala Thúpa, risking his own life in order to make the building secure. He made a cover for the whole thúpa and, at its dedication, held the great Giribhandapújá (Mhv.xxiv.68-81). Kanitthatissaka built a monastery attached to the thúpa (Mhv.xxxvi.9), which Gothábhaya renovated (Mhv.xxxvi.106).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vihára was rebuilt or enlarged by Dhátusena. He intended to give it into the charge of the Theravádins, but ultimately gave it to the Dhammarucikas at the latters' request (Cv.xxxviii.76). Sirimeghavanna had a life-size golden image of Mahinda placed in the Ambatthala Cetiya (Cv.xxxvii.69).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is said that the place was so called after the riddle of the mango tree (Mhv.xiv.17ff.) with which Mahinda put Devánampiyatissa's discernment to the test. Even now mango trees are planted near the ceitya in memory of the event (Cv.trans. i.4. n.5).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other names for the place are Cetiyambatthala (Cv.xxxvii.69) and Therambatthalaka (Mhv.xxxvi.106).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

When Dutthagámani planned to build the Mahá Thúpa silver appeared near a cave in this district by the power of the devas and was discovered by a merchant who reported the find to the king; the king himself came to gather the silver for the thúpa (Mhv.xxviii.20-35; MT.512).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later, Amandagámani Abhaya built the Rajatalena Vihára here (Mhv.xxxv.4, 5). It was in this district, in the neighbourhood of the Kuthári Vihára, that Moggallána defeated his brother the parricide Kassapa I. (Cv.xxxix.21ff)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Mahávamsa Tíká it was in Ambatthakola that King Mahácúlí Mahátissa worked in Sonnagiri in a sugar mill to earn money for an alms-giving (MT.624; Mhv.xxxiv.4f ) (v.l.

She saw the Buddha going on his begging round, and having nothing else to offer, gave him, with very pious heart, some dried flesh, old and salt less. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She thought constantly of her gift, and after death was born in a vimána in &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/t/taavatimsa')"&gt;Távatimsa&lt;/a&gt;, where &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/maha_moggallana_th')"&gt;Moggallána&lt;/a&gt; came across her and heard from her story' (v.l.

Later he renounced the world and, with a large band of followers, wandered about Anga, Magadha and Kururattha,, teaching a cult of nature-worship. The Buddha, seeing his upanissaya, sent Moggallána to convert him. Moggallána went to Aggidatta's hermitage, but being refused shelter there, vanquished, by a display of iddhi-power, a nágarája, Ahicchatta, who lived in the neighbourhood, and occupied the nága's abode. While Aggidatta and his followers stand awestruck at this event, the Buddha appears, and realising that the Buddha is even greater than Moggallána, they pay homage to him. The Buddha preaches to them on the error of their ways. At the end of the discourse they become arahants (DhA.iii.241-7).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Aggidatta.-A brahmin of Benares and father of the Bodhisatta, when the latter was born as Somadatta. The old man lived by ploughing, and one of his oxen having died, he decided, on the advice of his son, to ask the king for an ox. Somadatta, with great patience, trained him in all the formalities to be gone through in an appearance at court, but at the crucial moment when Aggidatta was making his petition to the king, he used the word &quot;take&quot; where he meant to use &quot;give.&quot; Somadatta's presence of mind saved the situation (DhA.iii.124-5). In the Somadatta Játaka the name Aggidatta does not appear. In the present age he was the Thera Láludáyí. J.ii.164f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Ambattha-gotta&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The clan to which Ambattha-mánava belonged. The Kanháyana-gotta was probably one of its chief sections, or, perhaps, the family of its original ancestors. In the Buddha's time the clan was evidently considered very aristocratic, at least by its own members, for they looked down upon even the Sákiyans as scorings from their kinsmen's feet, though the Sákiyans themselves seem to have laughed at the pretensions of the Ambatthas (See Ambattha-mánava above). Nor were the Ambatthas brahmins by birth; some of them were farmers and traders and some even sold their daughters for gold. J.iv.363; they were called brahmins by courtesy voháravasena (ibid., 366).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Mánavadhammasástra, they were not sprung from Ksatriya father and a slave (presumably Sudra) mother, as given in the Ambattha Sutta, but from a brahmin father and a Vaisya mother.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Ambatthas were of an old stock and were well known. Besides the Ambattha-mánava mentioned above, another Ambattha, called Súra, is spoken of in the Pitakas (E.g., A.i.26; iii.451).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

He lived in the heap of sand which was made by Aggidatta (q.v.) and his followers, who had made a vow to bring from somewhere a jar of sand and empty it at an agreed spot whenever a sinful thought occurred to them. When Moggallána visited Aggidatta and asked him for a lodging, Aggidatta refused to give him one, but Moggallána, in spite of his protests, occupied the sand-hill. Moggallána overcame the power of the Nága king by his iddhi-power, and when Aggidatta and his followers visited him the next morning, they found Ahicchatta standing with his hood over Moggallána's head as protection for him from the sun.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Aggikkhandopama Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preached by the Buddha while touring in Kosala with a large concourse of monks, the sight of a blazing fire being made the occasion for the discourse. It were better for a man to seek shelter in, embrace and lie down upon the raging flames than to live in the guise of a monk and accept the alms of the faithful while being guilty of evil conduct (A.iv.128f). It is said that while the sutta was being preached sixty monks vomited hot blood, sixty left the Order in diffidence and sixty others became arahants (A.iv.135). The Commentary adds that the Buddha foresaw this result, and that later many of the monks, hearing of the discourse and fearing dire consequences for themselves, returned to the lay-life in such large numbers that the Order became rapidly depleted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was to counteract this result that the Cúlaccharásangháta Sutta was preached (AA.i.38-40). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This sutta is mentioned as an example of a sermon based on some immediate experience, in this case, a fire (MA.i.14; also AA.i.32, 267). It was preached by Mahinda in Ceylon, in the Nandana pleasance, on the day the Mahámeghavana was gifted to the Sangha (Mhv.xv.176; Mbv.133); and also by Yonaka Dhammarakhita, in Aparantaka (Mhv.xii.34; Mbv.114).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vomiting of hot blood, mentioned here, is made the subject of a dilemma in the Milinda (p.164).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Once, during a festival, he left the monkey with a corn-factor (the Bodhisatta) and set out to earn money by making sport with the snake. The monkey was well looked after by the Bodhisatta. Seven days later the snake-charmer returned drunk and ill-treated the monkey. When the man was asleep the monkey escaped and refused to come back in spite of his former owner's fine words.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told with reference to a novice who was ordained by a distinguished Elder. The Elder ill-treated the lad who, in exasperation, left the Order. The Elder persuaded him to return, but when this had happened twice again, the lad refused to come back (J.iii.197-9). The novice is identified with the monkey of the story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Mahosadha, while seeking for a wife, met her as she was taking a meal to her father and entered into conversation with her. He asked her various questions and she answered in riddles. Mahosadha went to her father's house and plied his trade as a tailor, taking the opportunity of observing the girl's behaviour. He tested her temper and her character in various ways, and being satisfied that she was altogether desirable, he married her with the approval of Queen Udumbará. She became popular with everybody and was of great assistance to her husband in frustrating the attempts of his enemies to work him harm (J.vi.364-72, 392; the story appears also in Mtu.ii.83).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the present age Amará was the beautiful Bimbádeví (J.vi.478).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Milinda (pp.205ff ) the king mentions the story of Amarádeví having been left behind in the village while her husband was away on a journey, and of her resisting a temptation to be unfaithful to him. &quot;If that be true, how,&quot; asks the king, &quot;could you justify the Buddha's statement (*) that all women will go wrong, failing others, even with a cripple?&quot; Nágasena explains this by saying that Amará did not sin because she had neither real secrecy nor opportunity nor the right-wooer!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;(*) Incidentally, these words do not   really belong to the Buddha. They appear in the Kunála Játaka (J.v.435), which   is a specimen of Indian folklore and not of Buddhist belief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

At the end of the conversation he became arahant with a thousand followers and entered the Order (SnA.587, but see ThagA. [infra], where he is said to have become an arahant later).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was the son of a Brahmin of Sávatthi, price-assessor (aggásaniya) to the King of Kosala (ThagA.i.73f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Anguttara Commentary (i.184) he was the nephew of Bávarí, and the latter particularly asked him to come back to him with news of the interview with the Buddha (ThagA.loc cit).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a previous birth he offered a kapittha-fruit to Vipassí Buddha. He is probably to be identified with the Kapittha-phaladáyaka Thera of the Apadána (Ap.ii.449).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A verse attributed to Ajita-mánava is found in the Theragáthá (v.20).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Ajita-pucchá are referred to in the Samyutta, (ii.47f) where they are expounded by the Buddha to Sáriputta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Alagakkonára&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;An eminent prince of Ceylon in the time of Vikkamabáhu IV. He was of the Giri family and lived in Peraddoní (modern Perádeniya). The Cúlavamsa does not recount much of him, save that he was full of virtue and piety and that he did many good deeds, such as the advancement of the Order; also that he was the founder of Jayavaddhanakotta, which soon after became the capital of Ceylon (Cv.xci.3-9). The Sinhalese chronicles, however (See Cv.Trs.ii.212, n.4), tell us a good deal about him, the most important fact being that he succeeded in breaking the power of the Jaffna king which was then at its height. Formerly it was believed that Alagakkonára later became king under the name of Bhuvanekabáhu V., but now that opinion has been given up.

The story is related regarding a brother who was very zealous in his duties, doing everything well and wholeheartedly. Because of his great goodness the people fed regularly every day five hundred of the Brethren. J.i.449-51.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Amba Játaka (No. 474).&lt;/b&gt;-The story of a brahmin youth who learnt a charm from a wise Candála. The charm had the power of making lovely and fragrant mangoes grow out of season. The youth exhibited his skill before the king, but when asked the name of his teacher he lied and said he had been taught in Takkasilá. Immediately the charm escaped his memory and all his power deserted him. At the king's suggestion he went back to the teacher to ask his forgiveness and to learn the charm anew, but the teacher would have none of him and the youth wandered away into the forest and died there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story is told in reference to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/devadatta')"&gt;Devadatta&lt;/a&gt; who had repudiated the Buddha as his teacher and as a result was born in Avíci (J.iv.200-7).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The youth was a former birth of Devadatta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Akanitthá devá&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A class of devas, living in the highest of the five Suddhávasá (Pure Mansions) (D.iii.237).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahapadana_s')"&gt;Mahápadána Sutta&lt;/a&gt; (D.ii.52f) the Buddha mentions that he visited their abode and conversed with beings who were born there as a result of the holy lives they had lived under various Buddhas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sakkapanha_sutta')"&gt;Sakkapañha Sutta&lt;/a&gt; (D.ii.286) &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sakka')"&gt;Sakka&lt;/a&gt; speaks of them as the highest devas, and expresses his satisfaction that he, too, will be born among them in his last life.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddhagosa')"&gt;Buddhaghosa&lt;/a&gt; says they are so called because of their supremacy in virtue and in happiness, and because there are no juniors among them (sabbeh'eva sagunehi ca bhavasampattiyá ca jetthá n'atth'ettha kanittháti akanitthá). DA.ii.480. VbhA.521 [áyuná ca paññaya ca Akanitthá jetthaká sabba-devehi panítatará devá (=DA.iii.739)].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/visuddhi_magga')"&gt;Visuddhi Magga&lt;/a&gt; (p. 634) their world is spoken of as a Brahma loka where Anágámís are born and enter complete Nibbána (p. 710) (also ItA.40; DA.iii.740). The duration of life among these devas is 16,000 Kalpas (Kvu.207). Sometimes Anágámí are born among the Avihá devas and finish their existence, in a subsequent birth, among the Akanitthás. These are called &quot;Uddhamsotá.&quot; (DhA.iii.289f.; see also S.v.201).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Akanittha-bhavana is the upper limit of the rúpvacara-bhúmi (Ps.i.84); it is also spoken of as the highest point of the universe, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/aviici')"&gt;Avíci&lt;/a&gt; being the lowest. Thus the quarrel among the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kosambii')"&gt;Kosambí&lt;/a&gt; monks spread even up to the Akanitthá devá (J.iii.487), as did the shouts of the assembly at the severing of </data>

Ambalatthiká.&lt;/b&gt;-A royal park on the road between &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/r/raajagaha')"&gt;Rájagaha&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/n/naalandaa')"&gt;Nálandá&lt;/a&gt;. It contained a royal rest-house (rájágáraka) in which the Buddha and members of the Order used to stay in the course of their journeying. It was on one such occasion that the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/brahmajala_s')"&gt;Brahmajála Sutta&lt;/a&gt; was preached (Vin.ii.287; D.i.1). Buddhaghosa (DA.i.41-2) says that it was a shady and well-watered park, so called because of a mango sapling which stood by the gateway. It was surrounded and well guarded by a rampart, and its rest-house was adorned with paintings for the king's amusement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was one of the spots in which the Buddha rested during his last tour, and we are told that while there he discoursed to a large number of monks (D.ii.81; he remained there one night, UdA.408). But the most famous of the Buddha's sermons in Ambalatthiká seems to have been the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/r/raahulovaada_s')"&gt;Ráhulováda Sutta&lt;/a&gt; named Ambalatthika-Ráhulováda Sutta, because of its having been preached in the park (M.i.414ff). From the context it appears as though Ambalatthiká was within walking distance from the Kalandakanivápa in Rájagaha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But see below (4) for a more probable explanation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Ambalatthiká.&lt;/b&gt;-A park in the brahmin village Khánumata. The Buddha went there during one of his tours through Magadha. On this occasion was preached the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kuutadanta_s')"&gt;Kútadanta Sutta&lt;/a&gt; (D.i.127). Buddhaghosa (DA.i.294) says the park was like the pleasance of the same name between Rájagaha and Nálandá.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Ambalatthiká.&lt;/b&gt;-There was a place of </data>
<data>this name to the east of the Lohapásáda in Anurádhapura. Once when the Díghabhánaka Theras recited the Brahmajála Sutta there, the earth trembled from the water upwards (DA.i.131).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On another occasion King Vasabha heard the Díghabhánakas reciting the Mahásudassana Sutta, and thinking that they were discussing what they had eaten and drunk, he approached closer to listen; when he discovered the truth he applauded the monks (DA.ii.635).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The place referred to here was probably not a park, but a building which formed part of the Lohapásáda. In the Mahávamsa account (Mhv.xxvii.11-20) of the building of the Lohapásáda we are told that the plans were copied from the gem-palace of the goddess Bíraní. The central part of the palace was called the Ambalatthikapásáda. &quot;It was visible from every side, bright, with pennons hung out.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dutthagámani probably included a similar central part in the Lohapásáda. This view is strengthened by No. 4 below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Ambalatthiká.&lt;/b&gt;-According to Buddhaghosa (MA.ii.635), the Ambalatthiká, in which the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/r/raahulovaada_s')"&gt;Ráhulováda Sutta&lt;/a&gt; of that name was preached, was not a pleasance, but a pásáda, a kind of meditation hall (padhánagharasankhepa) built in the outskirts of Veluvanavihára for the use of those who desired solitude. It is said that &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/r/raahula')"&gt;Ráhula&lt;/a&gt; spent most of his time there, from the day of his ordination as a seven-year-old boy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

The king, having heard of Bimbádeví's affliction, ordered that she should be continually supplied with mango-syrup. On being told of the incident, the Buddha revealed this story of the past to show that it was not the first time that Sáriputta had obtained mango-syrup for Bimbádeví.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The atítavatthu is about the chief queen of a king of Benares. Sakka, becoming nervous on account of the austerities of an ascetic, wishes to destroy him, and arouses in the queen a desire for a &quot;Midmost Mango&quot; (Abbhantara-Amba). After prolonged search - during which the ascetic and his companions are driven from the royal park because they are reported to have eaten the mangoes there - a favourite parrot of the palace is commissioned to find the Midmost Mango. He goes to Himavá, and learns from the parrots of the seventh mountain range that the mango grows on a tree which belongs to Vessavana and which is most strictly guarded. He goes stealthily by night to the tree, but is caught by the guardian goblins, who decide to kill him. He tells them that he is delighted to die in the performance of his duty, and thereby wins their respect. Following their counsel, he seeks the assistance of an ascetic, Jotirasa, living in a hut called Kañcanapatti, to whom Vessavana sends a daily offering of four mangoes. The ascetic gives the parrot two mangoes, one for himself and one for the queen. J.ii.392-400.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ananda was the parrot and Sáriputta Jotirasa. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

In the time of the Buddha Padumuttara he lit a lamp in front of the Enlightened One. As a result of this he enjoyed happiness in heaven for 60,000 kappas, and when he was born from Tusita in this Buddha-age there was a great light on the day of his birth. He is stated to have been a disciple of Bávarí (Ap.i.337, 28), but he heard of the Buddha while in Himavá. Later he became an arahant.&lt;/p&gt;</data>

Aciravatí.&lt;/b&gt;-A river, the modern Rápti in Oudh; one of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/pancanadi')"&gt;Pañca-mahánadí&lt;/a&gt; (Vin.ii.237), the five great rivers flowing from the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/h/himava')"&gt;Himálaya&lt;/a&gt; eastwards (pácínaninná) (S.v.39, etc.) into the sea. During the hot season it ran dry, leaving a bed of sand (A.iv.101). It flowed through &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kosala')"&gt;Kosala&lt;/a&gt;, and at &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/saavatthi')"&gt;Sávatthi&lt;/a&gt; an udumbara grove grew on its banks; it, could be seen from the terrace of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/pasenadi')"&gt;Pasenadi's&lt;/a&gt; palace (Vin.iv.111-12; SnA.i.19). To the south of it was &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/manasaakata')"&gt;Manasákata&lt;/a&gt;, and on its southern bank was a mango grove where the Buddha sometimes resided (D.i.235-6). The Tevijja Sutta was preached here, and the Aciravatí is used in a simile to prove the futility of sacrifices and prayers: it is of no use standing on one bank of the river and calling to the other bank to come over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the river were many bathing places, in some of which courtesans bathed naked; the Bhikkhunís did likewise until a rule was passed prohibiting it (Vin.i.293; iv.278). The &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/chabbaggiyaa')"&gt;Chabbaggiya&lt;/a&gt; nuns, however, continued to do so even afterwards (Vin.iv.259f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The river was crossed in rafts (Vin.iii.63); it sometimes became so full (D.i.244-5; M.iii.117; J.iv.167) that disastrous floods occurred, in one of which &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/viduudabha')"&gt;Vidúdabha&lt;/a&gt; and his army were swept into the sea (DhA.i.360).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In sheltered spots monks and brahmins used to bathe (Vin.iv.161), and once &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/saariputta')"&gt;Sáriputta&lt;/a&gt; himself bathed there (AA.i.315). </data>
<data>The &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/s5_say')"&gt;Sattarasa-vaggiya&lt;/a&gt; monks frequented the river for water-sports (Vin.iv.111-12).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the Buddha was told that the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/pancavaggiya')"&gt;Pañcavaggiya&lt;/a&gt; monks were in the habit of seizing the cows that crossed the river (Vin.i.191).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The elder &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/siivalii')"&gt;Sivalí&lt;/a&gt; stopped on the banks of the Aciravatí while on his way to the Himálaya with five hundred monks (AA.i.139). In the time of Kassapa Buddha the river flowed round Sávatthi and, at the eastern fort, flowed into a wide and deep lake on which separate bathing places were made for the king, the people, the Buddha and the Order respectively (MA.i.371).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The people on the banks were in the habit of casting nets for fish (UdA.366). Near the river was &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/dandakappaka')"&gt;Dandakappa&lt;/a&gt;, a Kosalan village, and while staying there Ananda bathed in the river with many other monks (A.iii.402).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two occasions are mentioned on which monks hit in the eye swans flying over the river (J.i.418 and ii.366. See also DhA.iv.5 and 8f). It was here that &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/patacara')"&gt;Patácárá's&lt;/a&gt; child was drowned (DhA.ii.264).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kapila')"&gt;Kapila&lt;/a&gt; was born here as a golden fish as a result of his evil deeds (DhA.iv.41; see also &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/k3_kay')"&gt;Kapila S&lt;/a&gt;). In the Avadána Sataka (DhA.i.63; also ii.60) the name is given as Aciravatí, and according to I Tsing (p.156) means the river of the Aji (dragon).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2.

Monks should not accept or use a pond or any such thing, unless it has been properly gifted to them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if the real owners of the pond, etc., or their heirs, or, if no heirs exist, the chief of the district, having discovered that the pond was being used by monks, were to give it to the monks, then the gift becomes kappiya, &quot;as in the case of the bucket of water taken by the monk of Cittalapabbata and Alandanágarájamahesí&quot; - evidently meaning that the water was later given to the monk by the mahesí, thereby making it kappiya.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

He revealed the peta's story in the presence of the Buddha. In the long past men had erected a bower of leaves and grass on the banks of the river near &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/baranasi')"&gt;Benares&lt;/a&gt; for a Pacceka Buddha. Here residents from the city would visit him morning and evening with offerings. On the way they had to pass a field, which in their many journeying they trampled and damaged. The farmer tried in vain to prevent them. One day, in exasperation, when the Pacceka Buddha was away, the farmer burnt his bower, destroying everything in it. When he confessed his guilt the followers of the Pacceka Buddha beat him to death. He suffered in Avíci till the earth was elevated one league, and was thereafter born a peta, twenty-five leagues in length, his body enveloped in flames.

When the Bulis of Allakappa heard of the Buddha's death, they sent messengers to the Mallas asking for a portion of the relics, claiming that they too, like the Buddha, were khattiyas. Having obtained them, they later built a thúpa over them (D.ii.166-7; Bv.xxviii.2).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Allakappa seems to have had a republican form of government, but its importance was not very great. According to the Dhammapada Commentary (DhA.i.161), Allakappa was ten leagues in extent and its king was on intimate terms of friendship with the King of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/vethadiipa')"&gt;Vethadípaka&lt;/a&gt;. They spent a great deal of their time together, so that the two countries must have been near each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Allakappa.&lt;/b&gt;-The King of Allakappa and friend of King &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/vethadiipa')"&gt;Vethadípaka&lt;/a&gt;. They both renounced their kingdoms and became ascetics in the Himálaya. At first they lived in the same hermitage, but later separated and lived apart, meeting once a fortnight, on fast-days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vethadípaka died and was born a mighty king of devas. Soon after, when visiting Allakappa, he learned that the latter's asceticism was being disturbed by wild elephants. Vethadípaka gave him a lute with which to charm them, and spells whereby he might influence them. The lute had three strings; at the plucking of the first, the elephants ran away at once, of the second they ran away but looked back at each step, but when the third was plucked, the leader of the herd came and offered the player his back on which to sit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some time later, Allakappa met the Queen </data>
<data>of Parantapa, King of Kosambi, with her son Udena, who had been born in the forest, the queen having been carried thither by a large bird of prey. Allakappa took them to the hermitage and looked after them, in ignorance of their high estate. He later lived with the queen as his wife. One day he perceived, by the occultation of Parantapa's star, that the king was dead; he told this to the queen who then confessed her identity and that of Udena, the legitimate heir to the throne. Allakappa gave to Udena the magic lute and taught him the spells that by their power he might gain his heritage.

The festival lasted for seven days (Mhv.v.94). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Mahávamsa Tíká explains it by saying that the king fasted for seven days, standing gazing at the figure with unwinking eyes.

A brahmin youth of the Ambattha clan who lived with his teacher, Pokkharasádi, at Ukkatthá. He was learned in the three Vedas and the correlated branches of knowledge, including the Lokáyata, as recorded in the Ambattha Sutta (D.i.87ff). Once, at the request of his teacher, he visited the Buddha in the Icchánadkala wood and seems to have opened his conversation by reviling the Sákiyans and calling them menials. It appears that Ambattha had once gone on some business of Pokkharasádi's to Kapilavatthu, to the Mote Hall of the Sákyans, and had been insulted there (D.i.91).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked by the Buddha to what family he belonged, Ambattha replied that he came of the Kanháyana-gotta; thereupon the Buddha traced the family back to its ancestor, who had been the offspring of a slave girl of Okkáka, named Disá. The child had been able to talk as soon as he was born and, because of this devilish trait, had been called Kanha (devil), hence the family name. Kanha later became a mighty seer and married Maddarúpí, daughter of Okkáka (D.i.96-7).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ambattha makes no remonstrance against this genealogy and, under pressure, accepts it as true. This gives the Buddha an opportunity of preaching on the futility of feeling vanity regarding one's caste and on the worth of morality and conduct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the end of the discourse the Buddha walked up and down outside his chamber so that Ambattha might see on his body the thirty-two signs of a great man. Ambattha goes back to Pokkharasadi and reports the whole interview. Pokkharasádi is greatly incensed, abuses Ambattha and kicks him. Later Pokkharasádi goes himself to the Buddha and invites him for </data>
<data>a meal. At the end of the meal the Buddha instructs him in his Doctrine and is accepted as the Teacher both of Pokkharasádi himself and of his followers and dependants at Ukkatthá. Pokkharasádi himself becomes a Sotápanna (DA.i.278).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are not told that Ambattha became a follower of the Buddha. Buddhaghosa says (DA.i.274) that the Buddha knew that Ambattha would not profit by his discourse in his present life (iminá attabhávena magga-pátubhávo natthi), and that therefore a sermon with the idea of converting him would only have meant spending unnecessary time. Ambattha himself only visited the Buddha on account of his interest in physiognomy. According to Buddhaghosa the idea of the Buddha in preaching the Ambattha Sutta at such length was that it might be repeated to Pokkharasádi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is conjectured that the Ambattha, who is identified with Kávinda, one of the counsellors of King Vedeha, in the Ummagga Játaka (J.vi.478), probably refers to the Ambattha of this sutta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2.

It was in Uruvelá, on the banks of the Nerañjara, near the Bodhi tree, and a week after the Enlightenment the Buddha went there and spent a week cross-legged at the foot of the tree. There he met the Huhunkajátika Brahmin (Vin.i.2-3). Two weeks later he went there again from the Rajáyatana (Vin.i.4). It was then that the Brahma Sahampati appeared to him and persuaded him to preach the doctrine, in spite of the difficulty of the task (Vin.i.5-7; in the eighth week after the Enlightenment, says Buddhaghosa, SA.i.152). This was immediately after the meal offered by Tapassu and Bhalluka, so says the Majjhima Atthakathá (i.385; J.i.81). When the Buddha wishes to have someone as his teacher, Sahampati appears again and suggests to him that the Dhamma be considered his teacher (A.ii.20f.; S.i.138f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Ajapála-nigrodha it was, too, that, immediately after the Enlightenment, Mara tried to persuade the Buddha to die at once (D.ii.112). Several other conversations held here with Mara are recorded in the Samyutta (S.i.103f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, also, the Buddha spent some time before the Enlightenment (D.ii.267), and it was here that Sujata offered him a meal of milk-rice (J.i.16, 69).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, in the fifth week after the Enlightenment, Mara's daughters tried to tempt the Buddha (J.i.78, 469).'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several etymologies are suggested for the name: (a) in its shadow goatherds (ajapálá) rest; (b) old brahmins, incapable of reciting the Vedas, live here in dwellings protected by walls and ramparts (this derivation being as follows: na japantí ti =ajapá, mantánam anajjháyaká=ajapá, álenti aríyanti nivásam ettháti=Ajapálo ti); (c) it shelters </data>
<data>the goats that seek its shade at midday (UdA.51). The northern Buddhists say that the tree was planted by a shepherd boy, during the Bodhisatta's six years' penance, to shelter him (Beal, Romantic Legend of Buddha,192, 238; Mtu.iii.302).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Brahmá Sutta (S.v.167) and the Magga Sutta (S.v.185), both on the four satipatthána, and another Brahmá Sutta (S.v.232f) on the five indriyáni, were concerning thoughts that occurred to the Buddha on various occasions at the foot of this tree, when he sat there soon after the Enlightenment. On all these occasions Brahma Sahampati appeared to him and confirmed his thoughts. Several old brahmins, advanced in years, visited the Buddha during this period and questioned him as to whether it were true that he did not pay respect to age. To them he preached the four Thera-karaná dhamma. A.ii.22.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

So she sent a man to ask the Buddha's advice and he permitted her to be ordained by a messenger (Thig.vv.25-6; ThigA.30ff.; Vin.ii.277; Ap. ii. 610-11). Her case established a precedent (Sp.i.242). Later she attained arahantship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has been suggested (VT.iii.360, n.3; and VT.ii.195-6, n.3) that her name &quot;half Kásí&quot; might mean that she charged five hundred pieces from her patrons. For, according to Buddhaghosa, Kásí means one thousand, and anything worth one thousand is called kásiya.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another explanation is, however, given by Dhammapála (ThigA.32). The revenue which accrued to the king for one day from Kásí was a thousand. Addhakásí's patrons had to give a like sum to spend a night with her. This is referred to in one of the verses attributed to her in the Theragáthá (v.25). For this reason she was called Kásí. But later, many men, not being able to afford a thousand, would pay half the amount and spend the day with her. As a result she became known as Addhakásí.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

He was a nihilist by persuasion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once while going through the city he saw a beautiful woman. Wishing to possess her, he commandeered her husband's services and one day ordered him to bring mud and lotuses from a pond three leagues away, his life to be the penalty if he did not return the same evening. Meanwhile Ambasakkhara ordered the guards to shut the city gates earlier than usual. The woman's husband returned to the city before nightfall, but finding the gates shut, he asked a thief, who was impaled just outside, to bear witness to his having arrived before sunset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The thief's uncle had been a pious merchant in Vesáli, but had been beheaded for alleged implication in his nephew's theft. He had been reborn as a peta, and because of his good deeds he possessed various powers. By reason, however, of having once hidden, in jest, the clothes of a friend who was bathing in the river, he was born naked. Every night he came to see his nephew and encouraged him to go on living, in spite of his impalement, because the peta knew that suffering in hell awaited the thief after death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the man with the lotuses asked the thief's assistance in proving his innocence, he was advised to await the peta's arrival that night and to get his counsel. This the man did, and when, the next day, he was summoned before Ambasakkhara, he cited the peta as witness for his defence. Ambasakkhara agreed to test the truth of the story, and in the night he saw the peta and learnt all that had happened. Greatly marvelling, he offered to </data>
<data>help the peta in getting rid of his nudity. He was asked to seek the holy Elder &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kappitaka_th')"&gt;Kappitaka&lt;/a&gt; who lived in &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kapinacanaa')"&gt;Kapinaccaná&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/va/vajjii')"&gt;Vajji&lt;/a&gt; country and give him robes in the peta's name. This was done, and the peta immediately appeared before them clad in heavenly robes. From that time Ambasakkhara was converted to the Faith, and after having listened to a sermon by Kappitaka became a Sotápanna. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The impaled thief was set free and was cured by the royal physician; he later attained to the state of an arahant.

He had been warned by his father about the wiles of women, and lived in the forest practising the most severe austerities. By virtue of the power of these austerities, Sakka's abode trembled, and Sakka, fearing his rivalry, sent down a beautiful celestial nymph, Alambusá, to tempt him and despoil him of his virtue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This she succeeded in doing, and for three years he lay unconscious in her embrace. At last, realising what had happened, he forthwith forsook sensual desire, and developing mystic meditation, attained to jhána. Alambusá pleaded for forgiveness, which was readily granted. The story was related in reference to the temptation of a monk by the wife he had had during his lay life (J.v.152-61. See also the Naliniká J.

The gardener found her at the foot of a mango tree - hence her name - and brought her to the city. She grew up so full of beauty and of grace that many young princes vied with each other for the honour of her hand. Finally, in order to end their strife, they appointed her courtesan. Later she became a devout follower of the Buddha, and building a vihára in her own garden, gave it to him and the Order. This was during the Buddha's last visit to Vesáli shortly before his death. It is said that when Ambapálí heard of the Buddha's visit to Kotigáma near Vesáli she and her retinue drove out of the city in magnificent chariots to meet him, and, after hearing a discourse, invited him and the monks to a meal the next day. The Buddha accepted this invitation and had, as a result, to refuse that of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/l/licchavi')"&gt;Licchavis&lt;/a&gt; of Vesáli.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While returning from her visit to the Buddha, Ambapálí was so elated at the idea of having the Buddha to a meal the next day, that she refused to make way for the Licchavi princes who were on their way to the Buddha. She refused to give up her invitation for anything in the world. The DA. says that just before Ambapálí's visit to him, the Buddha admonished the monks to be steadfast and mindful, lest they should lose their heads about her (DA.ii.545).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was after this meal that Ambapálí gave over her park, the Ambapálivana, to the Buddha and the Order. The Buddha accepted the gift and stayed there some time before going on to Beluva. Vin.i.231-3; D.ii.95-8; the two accounts vary in details, e.g. in the Digha </data>
<data>version the Buddha was already in Ambapálivana, and not in Kotigáma, when the courtesan visited him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ambapálí had a son, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/vimalakondanna_thera')"&gt;Vimala-Kondañña&lt;/a&gt;, who was an eminent Elder. Having heard him preach one day, she renounced the world and, working for insight by studying the law of impermanence as illustrated in her own ageing body, she attained arahantship (ThigA.206-7).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nineteen verses ascribed to her are found in the Therígáthá (252-70).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/sikhii')"&gt;Sikhí Buddha&lt;/a&gt; she had entered the Order. While yet a novice, she took part in a procession of Bhikkhunís, and was doing homage at a shrine when an arahant Therí in front of her hastily spat in the court of the shrine. Seeing the spittle and not knowing who had committed the fault, she said in reproof, &quot;What prostitute has been spitting here?&quot; It was owing to this remark that she was born as a courtesan in her last birth (ThigA.206-7).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Apadána (quoted also in ThigA) gives some more details about her. She had been a daughter of a Khattiya family in the time of Phussa Buddha and had done many good deeds in order to be beautiful in later births. As a result of the abuse of the nun (referred to above) she had been born in hell and later had, for ten thousand lives, been a courtesan. In Kassapa Buddha's time she had practised celibacy (Ap.ii.613ff. ; ThigA.213f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is said that she charged fifty kahápanas a night from her patrons and that Vesáli became very prosperous through her. It was this that prompted Bimbisára to get a courtesan for his own city of Rájagaha (Vin.i.268).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among Ambapálí's patrons was &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bimbisara')"&gt;Bimbisára&lt;/a&gt;, and he was the father of her son Vimala-Kondañña (ThagA.i.146).&lt;/p&gt;</data>
<data>&lt;p&gt;In the Theragáthá (vv.1020-21; ThagA.ii.129) there are two verses which, according to tradition, were spoken by &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/aa/aananda')"&gt;Ananda&lt;/a&gt; in admonition of monks who lost their heads at the sight of Ambapálí. Whether this was before or after she joined the Order we are not told.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

He annoyed the sage Gotama and was destroyed in spite of his bulk and his thousand arms (J.v.267). In the Sarabhanga Játaka he is mentioned as having sinned against Angírasa (J.v.135; also DA.i.266). He is identified with Arjuna, called Kártavíraya of the Kathásaritságara (ii.639), and in the Uttarakanda of the Rámáyana (Sarga 32).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He used to offer sacrifices to the gods (J.vi.201).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;6.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Aggálava Cetiya&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chief shrine at Álaví (SnA.i.344; SA.i.207) (hence probably the name), originally a pagan place of worship, but later converted into a Buddhist vihára. The Buddha stopped here on many occasions during his wanderings, and this was the scene of several Vinaya rules, e.g. against monks digging the ground (Vin.iv.32) and cutting trees (Vin.iv.34), using unfiltered water for building purposes (Vin.iv.48), sleeping in the company of novices (Vin.iv.16), giving new buildings in hand (Vin.ii.172f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Chabbaggiyá are censured here for a nissaggiya offence (Vin.iii.224). The Vangísa Sutta was preached there to Vangísa, on the occasion of the death of his preceptor, Nigrodhakappa (Sn.59f). In the early years of Vangísa's novitiate he stayed at the shrine with his preceptor, and disaffection arose within him twice, once because of women, the second time because of his tutor's solitary habits (S.i.185-6), and later, again, through pride in his own powers of improvisation (patibhána) (S.i.187). Here, again, the Buddha utters the praises of Hatthaka Alavaka, who visits him with a large following, whose fealty has been won (according to Hatthaka) by observing the four characteristics of sympathy (sangahavatthúni) learnt from the Buddha (A.iv.216-20).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many lay-women and nuns flocked there by day to hear the Buddha preach, but none were there when he preached in the evenings (J.i.160). It was here that the Manikantha Játaka was related (J.ii.282), also the Brahmadatta Játaka (J.iii.78), and the Atthisena Játaka (J.iii.351), all in connection with the rules for building cells.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Ajatasattu&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Son of Bimbisára, King of Magadha, and therefore half-brother to Abhayarájakumara. He succeeded his father to the throne. His mother was a daughter of Mahákosala (J.iii.121), and he married Vajirá, Pasenadi's daughter (J.iv.343), by whom be had a son Udáyibhadda (D.i.50).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ajatasattu grew up to be a noble and handsome youth. Devadatta was, at this time, looking for ways and means of taking revenge on the Buddha, and seeing in the prince a very desirable weapon, he exerted all his strength to win him to his side. Ajatasattu was greatly impressed by Devadatta's powers of iddhi and became his devoted follower (Vin.ii.185; J.i.185-6). He built for him a monastery at Gayásísa and waited upon him morning and evening carrying food for him, sometimes as much as five hundred cartloads in five hundred cooking pans (S.ii.242).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Devadatta incited him to seize the throne, killing his father if necessary. When Bimbisára learnt of the prince's intentions he abdicated in his favour. But Devadatta was not satisfied till Bimbisára, who was one of the Buddha's foremost supporters, was killed. (DA.i.135-7). According to the Sankicca Játaka (J.v.262ff.) he had killed his father in previous births too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ajátasattu helped Devadatta in several of the latter's attempts to kill the Buddha (See Devadatta). In the Sanjiva Játaka (J. i. &lt;st2:frenchfranctoeuro ProductID="510 f"&gt;510 f&lt;/st2:frenchfranctoeuro&gt;.) we are told that in past lives he had associated with the sinful and once lost his life as a result. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later he was filled with remorse for these past misdeeds as he confesses himself (D.i.85); but evidently, for very shame, he refrained from visiting the Buddha till he was won over by the </data>
<data>persuasions of his physician Jívaka Komárabhacca. And when in the end he did go to the Buddha, it was in great fear and trembling; so nervous was he that he imagined conspirators in the very silence surrounding the Buddha where he dwelt in the monastery, in Jivaka's Mango grove at Rájagaha (D.i.49-50; J.v.262-9. An illustration of this visit is the subject of one of the bas-reliefs on the Barhut Tope; Cunningham, Pl. xvi., fig.36, and p.135). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was on the occasion of this visit that the Sámaññaphala Sutta was preached. The king admits that he had been to various teachers before, but had failed to find satisfaction in their teachings. It is noteworthy that the Buddha greets the king cordially on his arrival and makes no mention whatever of the king's impiety. Instead, when Ajátasattu expresses his repentance at the end of the discourse, the Buddha accepts his confession and lets him off almost too lightly. But after the king had departed the Buddha tells the monks how the king's misdeeds had wrought his undoing both in this world and the next, for if he had not been guilty of them, the Eye of Truth (Sotápattimagga, says the Commentary) would have been opened for him on the occasion of this sermon. (D.i.85-6). It is said that from the day of his father's death he could not sleep on account of terrifying dreams, particularly after he had heard of Devadatta's dire fate (J.i.508). He slept after his visit to the Buddha (DA.i.238). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Henceforth the king became a loyal adherent of the Buddha's faith, though, as far as we know, he never waited again either upon the Buddha or upon any member of the Order for the discussion of ethical matters. (But see DA.i.238, where we are told &quot;tinnam ratanánam mahásakkáram akási&quot;). He was so full of love and respect for the Buddha that when he heard of Upaka Mandikáputta having spoken rather impolitely to the </data>
<data>Buddha, he at once flew into a rage (A.ii.182).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sakka said of him that among the puthujjanas he was most possessed of piety (DA.ii.610). When the Buddha died, in the eighth year of Ajátasattu reign (Mhv.ii.32), the latter's ministers decided not to tell him the news at once, in case he should die of a broken heart. On the pretext of warding off the evil effects of a dream, they placed him in a vat filled with the four kinds of sweet (catumadhura) and broke the sad news gently to him. He immediately fainted, and it was not till they put him in two other vats and repeated the tidings that he realised their implication (DA.ii.605-6). He forthwith gave himself up to great lamentation and despair, &quot;like a madman,&quot; calling to mind the Buddha's various virtues and visiting various places associated in his mind with the Buddha. Later he sent messengers to claim his share of the Buddha's relics, and when he obtained them he prolonged the rites held in their honour till the arahants had to seek Sakka's aid to make the king take the relics away to Rájagaha, where he erected over them a stone thupa (DA.ii.610). Two months afterwards, when the first Council was held, he gave the undertaking his royal patronage and assisted the monks who took part in it with all his power (Sp.i.10-11; DA.i.8-9).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several incidents connected with Ajátasattu's reign are mentioned in the books.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bimbisára had married a sister of Pasenadi, and when he was killed she died of grief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The revenue of a Kásí village had been given to her by her father, Mahákosala, as part of her dowry, but after Bimbisára's murder, Pasenadi refused to continue it. Thereupon Ajátasattu declared war on his uncle. Before this, uncle and nephew seem to have been on very friendly terms. Once Ajátasattu sent Pasenadi a wonderful piece of foreign </data>
<data>fabric, sixteen cubits long and eight broad, mounted on a pole to serve as a canopy. This Pasenadi gave to Ananda (M.ii.116). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At first he was victorious in three battles, but, later, he was defeated by Pasenadi, who followed the military advice of an old monk, the Elder Dhanuggahatissa; Ajátasattu was taken captive with his army. On giving an undertaking not to resort to violence again, he was released, and to seal the friendship, Pasenadi gave him his daughter Vajirá as wife, and the revenue of the disputed village was gifted to her as bath-money (S.i.82-5; J.ii.403-4; Avas. 54-7; J.iv.343f.; DhA.iii.259.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ajátasattu evidently took his reverses very unsportingly. (See the Haritamáta Játaka, J.ii.237f.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later, when through the treachery of Pasenadi's minister, Dígha Káráyana, his son Vidúdabha usurped the throne, Pasenadi, finding himself deserted, went towards Rájagaha to seek Ajátasattu’s help, but on the way he died of exposure and Ajátasattu gave him burial (See Pasenadi).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About a year before the Buddha's death, Ajátasattu sent his chief minister and confidant, the brahmin Vassakára, to the Buddha to intimate to him his desire to make war on the Vajjians and to find out what prediction the Buddha would make regarding his chances of victory. The Buddha informed the brahmin that the Vajjians practised the seven conditions of welfare which they had learnt from him, and that they were therefore invincible (D.ii.72f). The Samyutta Nikáya mentions the Buddha as saying that the time would come when the Vajjians would relinquish their strenuous mode of living and that then would come Ajátasattu’s chance. (S.ii.268). According to the Jainas, Ajátasattu fought with Cedaga, king of Vesáli, for the possession of an extraordinary elephant (Hoernle on Ájivaka in ERE i.). &lt;/p&gt;</data>
<data>&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This chance came about three years later, for by the treachery of Vassakára, he succeeded in sowing dissension among the leading families of Vesáli. Having thus weakened them, he swooped down upon the place with an overwhelming force and completely destroyed it (For details see Licchavi). Rumours are mentioned of King Candappajjota making preparations for a war on Ajátasattu to avenge the death of his friend Bimbisára, but no mention is made of actual fighting (M.iii.7; MA.ii.853; see also Buddhist India, p.13).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the end of Ajátasattu’s reign the books mention very little except that he was killed by his son Udaya or Udáyíbhadda (Mhv.iv.l), who had been born on the day that Bimbisára died as a result of his tortures (DA.i.137).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are told that Ajátasattu had feared that his son might kill him and had therefore secretly hoped that Udaya would become a monk (DA.i.153). Ajátasattu’s reign lasted thirty-two years (Mhv.ii.31; but see Geiger's Introd. to Mhv. trans. xi ff.; also Samaddar: Glories of Magadha, 17, n. 3; also Vincent Smith: Early History of India, pp. &lt;st2:frenchfranctoeuro ProductID="26 ff"&gt;26 ff&lt;/st2:frenchfranctoeuro&gt;.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was he who built the fortress of Pálátiputta, which later became the capital of Magadha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We do not know what Ajátasattu’s real name was. By the Jains he is called Kunika or Konika, which again is probably a nickname (Dial. ii.79, n.1). The title Vedehiputta which always accompanies his name probably means &quot;son of the Videha lady.&quot; At the time of Buddhaghosa there seems to have been much confusion about the meaning of this word. According to Buddhaghosa (DA.i.139) Vedehi means &quot;wise.&quot; There seems to have been another explanation which Buddhaghosa rejects - that Ajátasattu was the son of the </data>
<data>Videha queen. Videhi was probably the maiden, family, or tribal (not personal) name of his mother.  According to a Tibetan authority her personal name was Vásaví, and she was called Videhi because she was from Videha (Rockhill, p. 63. In the Pali books he is often referred to as Kosaladeví). (See also Vedehiká.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two explanations are given of the epithet Ajátasattu. According to Buddhaghosa he was so called because the soothsayers predicted his enmity to his father even before his birth, and a story is told of how his mother, at the time of his conception, had a longing to drink blood from Bimbisára’s right hand. The longing was satisfied, but when the queen heard the soothsayer's prediction, she tried, in many ways, to bring about a miscarriage. (DA.i.133ff.; J.iii.121-2) The park where she tried to bring about the miscarriage was called Maddakucchi (SA.i.61). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this she was prevented by the king. Later both parents grew to be very fond of him. There is a story of the prince, holding his father's finger, visiting Jotika's marvellous palace and thinking that his father was a fool for not taking Jotika's wealth. When he became king he acquired Jotika's palace. (DhA.iv.211 and 222f). As a boy he used to visit the Buddha with his father (DA.i.152).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To show Bimbisára’s love for the babe, an incident is mentioned of how once, when the prince was yelling with pain because of a boil on his finger, the nurses took him to the king who was then holding court. To soothe the child, the king put the offending finger in his mouth, where the boil burst. Unable to spit the pus out the king swallowed it (DA.i.138). The other explanation is that also found in the Upanisads, (Dial.ii.78f ) and this is probably the correct one. It says that the word means &quot;he against whom there has arisen no foe.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</data>
<data>&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Digha Commentary, (i.237-8) Ajátasattu was born in the Lohakumbhiya niraya after his death. He will suffer there for 60,000 years, and later will reach nibbana as a Pacceka Buddha named Viditavisesa (Vijitáví). Ajátasattu’s crime of parricide is often given as an example of an upacchedaka-kamma which has the power of destroying the effect of meritorious deeds (E.g., AA.i.369). He is also mentioned as the worst kind of parricide (E.g. AA.i.335).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ajátasattu seems to have been held in hatred by the Niganthas. The reason is probably that given in the Dhammapada Commentary (iii.66f), where it is said that when Moggallána had been killed by thieves, spies were sent out by the king to discover the murderers. When arrested, the murderers confessed that they had been incited by the Niganthas. The king thereupon buried five hundred Niganthas waist-deep in pits dug in the palace court and had their heads ploughed off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

He was a brahmin magnate of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/baranasi')"&gt;Benares&lt;/a&gt;, who, after giving away all his wealth in charity, retired to the forest with his sister, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/y/yasavatii')"&gt;Yasavatí&lt;/a&gt;. When gifts were brought to him as homage to his holiness, he sought obscurity, and, leaving his sister, dwelt in Káradípa, then known as Ahidípa, eating the leaves of a Kára-tree sprinkled with water. By virtue of his asceticism Sakka's throne was heated, and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sakka')"&gt;Sakka&lt;/a&gt; (Anuruddha in a previous birth), having tested him, and being satisfied that worldly attainments were not his aim, granted him various boons, including one that Sakka should not visit him any more and disturb his asceticism! (J.iv.236f). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His story is given in the Cariyápitaka (p.1), to illustrate dána-paramitá. In the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/n/nimi_jat_541')"&gt;Nimi Játaka&lt;/a&gt; he is mentioned in a list of eleven sages (*), who, by their holy lives; passed the Peta world to be born in Brahma's heaven. In the Játaka-málá (no.7) his name occurs as Agastya, but he should not be confused with the Vedic sage of that name (See Vedic Index). Perhaps he belonged to the Kassapagotta, because, in the conversation related in the Játaka story, Sakka addresses him as &quot;Kassapa.&quot; (J.iv.240-1)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(*) J.vi.99, the others being the seven brothers Yámahanu, Somayága, Manojava, Samudda, Mágha, Bharata and Kálikarakkhiya; and Angírasa, Kassapa and Kisavaccha.

The Buddha, while on his rounds, sees him tending the fire and preparing oblations, and stands for alms in front of his house. The brahmin abuses him, calling him mundaka and vasala. Thereupon the Buddha preaches to him the  &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/va/vasala_sutta')"&gt;Vasala Sutta&lt;/a&gt; (or, as it is sometimes called. the Aggika Bháradvája Sutta), and wins him over to the faith (Sn.21-5). The sobriquet Aggika was given to him because he was a tender of the sacred fire. SnA.i.174f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Aggika-Bháradvája.&lt;/b&gt;-A brahmin of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/r/raajagaha')"&gt;Rájagaha&lt;/a&gt;, evidently different from the above, also a fire-tender. He prepares a meal for sacrifice, and when the Buddha, out of compassion for him, appears before his house for alms, he says the meal is meant only for one who has the &quot;threefold lore&quot; (the three Vedas). The Buddha gives the brahmin another interpretation of the &quot;threefold lore&quot;; (see &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/am/aggika_sutta')"&gt;Aggika Sutta&lt;/a&gt;). The brahmin, thereupon, becomes a convert, enters the Order, and, in due course, attains arahantship. S.i.166f.; SA.i.179.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3.

Being pleased with the Elder Mahánáma of Macchikásanda, Citta invited him to a meal, and after listening to his discourse, gave the grove to the Order. At the dedication of the gift the earth trembled. Later he built a splendid monastery there, the Ambátakáráma, for the use of monks from all parts (AA.i.209; DhA.ii.74). It became the residence of large numbers of monks, and discussions often took place there between Cittagahapati and the resident bhikkhus (S.iv.281-97).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among eminent Elders who visited the place were &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Isidatta of Avanti (who answered   Citta's questions regarding the reason for the existence of various views in   the world) (S.iv.283-8), &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Mahaka (who, by his magic powers,   produced rain and thunderstorms and later showed a special miracle to Citta)   (S.iv.288-91), &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Kámabhú (who discoursed to Citta on   various topics) (S.iv.291-5), and &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Godatta (S.iv.295-7). &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The Elder Lakuntaka Bhaddiya also   lived there, in solitude, wrapt in meditation (Thag.v.466).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Behind Ambataka was Migapathaka, which was Citta's tributary village (SA.iii.93) (v.l.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Aggi-Bhagava&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A deity (probably identical with the Vedic Agni), worship of whom brought, as reward, birth in the Brahma-world. On the day a son is born, a fire (játaggi) is kindled; when the son comes of age and wishes to renounce household life, this fire is taken to the forest and homage is paid to Aggi-Bhagavá (J.i.285).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/n/nanguttha_jat_144')"&gt;Nanguttha Játaka&lt;/a&gt; (J.i.494-5) the Bodhisatta, having received an ox as a gift, wishes to offer the flesh to Aggi-Bhagavá, but thinking that the deity will not relish a salt less meal, he goes away in search of salt. He returns to find that the ox has been eaten by hunters, only the tail, one leg and the skin being left. &quot;If thou, Aggi-Bhagavá, hast not the power to look after thine own, how canst thou guard me?&quot; So saying, he quenches the fire with water and becomes an anchorite. In the verses of this context Aggi is addressed as &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/j/j')"&gt;Játaveda&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/santhava_jat_162')"&gt;Santhava Játaka&lt;/a&gt; (J.ii.43-5), too, the Bodhisatta is a votary of the deity. Once when he makes an offering of milk mixed with ghee the flames blaze forth and burn his hut, and thereupon he loses faith. In this story Aggi-Bhagavá seems to be identified with Mahá Brahmá. See also KS.i.209, n.4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the exegesis to the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bhuridatta_jat_543')"&gt;Bhuridatta Játaka&lt;/a&gt; (J.vi.202), the deity is spoken of as Aggideva, and mention is made of an enquiry made of learned brahmins by a king, Mujalinda, as to the way to heaven. In answer he is told that Aggideva is the bráhmanadevatá par excellence, and that he should be offered fresh ghee.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Abhibhúta&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Thera. He was born in the Rájá's family in Vettha (v.l. Vetthipura) and succeeded to his father's estate. When the Buddha came to the city during a tour, Abhibhúta heard him and invited him for a meal; he later entered the Order and became an arahant. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three verses ascribed to Abhibhúta occur in the Theragáthá, uttered, it is said, when his kinsmen and retainers came to him lamenting that he had left them without a leader (Thag.vv.255-7; ThagA.i.372f). The second of these verses is elsewhere (S.i.156) attributed to Abhibhú, chief disciple of Sikhí Buddha. But in the Milindapañha (245), Nágasena ascribes the second verse to the Buddha, and in the Maháparinibbána Sutta (D.ii.121) the third verse also is ascribed to him. The second verse is also assigned to the Buddha in the Divyávadána (p.200), but elsewhere in the same books (p.569) it is said to have been uttered by devas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a former birth Abhibhúta had been a householder in the time of Vessabhú Buddha and became a believer in the Faith, to which he was led by his friends. When the Buddha died, the populace gathered together to obtain relics, but Abhibhúta, having quenched the pyre with fragrant water, was first able to take those which he desired (ThagA.i.372).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is evidently to be identified with Citakanibbápaka Thera of the Apadána (ii.408).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Sankhapála, thereupon, invited Alára to the Nága kingdom where, for a whole year, Alára lived in all splendour.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later, realising that the Nága's wonderful possessions were the fruit of good deeds done in the past, he became an ascetic in Himavá and afterwards took up his abode in the king's park in &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/baranasi')"&gt;Benares&lt;/a&gt;. The king, seeing him on his begging-rounds, was pleased with his deportment and invited him to the palace.

Arittha held that according to the Doctrine, as he understood it, the states of mind, e.g. pleasures of sense, declared by the Buddha to be stumbling-blocks, are not such at all to the man who indulges in them. The Buddha questioned Arittha regarding this, and when Arittha acknowledged that such was his view, the Buddha rebuked him as having not even a spark of illumination regarding the Dhamma and the Vinaya.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Foolish persons, who have learned the Doctrine by heart but fail to study its import, quite miss the real meaning of their memorising and find no joy in it, using it solely as a means of stricture on others or of bandying verbal quotations; they are like a man who, finding a serpent, seizes it by its tail or coils and gets bitten, meeting thereby death or deadly hurt. But those, who comprehend all that the Doctrine embodies, resemble a man who pins a serpent securely down with a forked stick and grasps it firmly by its neck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This sutta also contains the parable of the raft. The Doctrine is like a raft to be used in crossing the flood and then to be abandoned. Even good things must eventually be discarded, therefore, how much more bad things?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last part of the sutta contains questions, chiefly on the mastery of self, asked by various monks, which the Buddha proceeds to explain (M.i.130ff.; MA.i.321ff). The sutta is quoted by Buddhaghosa (MA.i.136) as an example of a discourse of which the meaning is illustrated by a variety of similes (atthena upamam pariváretvá). (v.l.

As a result, in later births her body was the colour of the lotus and bore the perfume of the lotus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seventy times she reigned as queen of heaven and she was chief queen of sixty-three cakkavattis (ThigA. loc. cit.). She is evidently to be identified with Sattuppalamáliká of the Apadána (ii.517-18).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Abhidhamma Pitaka&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The third division of the Pitakas. It consists of seven books: the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Dhammasanganí, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Vibhanga, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Kathávatthu, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Puggalapaññatí, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Dhátukathá, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Yamaka and &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Patthána, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;all designated by the name of Pakarana. Only in the Chronicles and the Commentaries is the word used as the title of a third Pitaka (See the discussion of this in DA.i.15, 18f). In the Canon itself (E.g., Vin.i.64; iii.144; iv.344) the word means &quot;special dhamma,&quot; i.e. the Doctrine pure and simple (without admixture of literary treatment or personalities, etc.), and is sometimes coupled with the word abhivinaya (E.g., D.iii.267; M.i.272). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has been suggested (New Páli Dict. s.v.) that, as the word abhidhamma standing alone is not found either in the Sutta Nipáta, the Samyutta, or the Anguttara, and only once or twice in the Digha and Majjhima, it probably came into use only towards the end of the period in which the four great Nikáyas grew up (See Dial.iii.199 on a possible origin of the Adhidhamma).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Mahásanghikas refused to include the Abhidhamma in the Pitakas at all, as they did not regard it as the word of the Buddha. (Dpv.v.32-8).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Dighabhánakas the Abhidhamma Pitaka also included the whole of the Khuddaka Nikáya except the Cariyápitaka, Apadána and Buddhavamsa (DA.i.15).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to another division, the five Nikáyas are not divisions of the Dhamma but of the whole Canon, and in the fifth </data>
<data>are included both the Vinaya and the Abhidhamma (DA.i.28).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a legend recorded by Buddhaghosa that the Abhidhamma was first preached by the Buddha in Távatimsa at the foot of the Páricchataka tree, when he was seated on Sakka's throne, during his visit to his mother in Távatimsa. Later it was taught by him to Sáriputta on the banks of the Anotatta Lake, whither Sáriputta had gone to minister to the Buddha during the latter's visit to Távatimsa (VibhA. p.1; AA.i.71, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The legend further relates that after the Enlightenment the Buddha spent the fourth week in the Ratanaghara, revolving in his mind the intricate doctrines of the Abhidhamma in all their details (J.i.78).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Cullavagga version of the Councils (Chaps. xi. and xii; but see DA.i.15 contra) the Abhidhamma Pitaka was not rehearsed at either Council.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fact that the Abhidhamma is not mentioned in the suttas and that only Dhamma and Vinaya are usually referred to, only proves that at one time the Abhidhamma did not form a separate Pitaka. As a matter of fact, it is not held even by the commentators to be the word of the Buddha in the same sense as the suttas. One section of it, the Kathávatthu (but see Kathávatthu), was taught only at the Third Council.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As far as we know, the seven books of the Abhidhamma are peculiar to the Theravádins, though there is evidence that other schools, chiefly the Vaibhásikas (Sarvástivádins) and the Sautrántikas, held the Abhidhamma books sacred. See Táránátha: Geschichte des Buddhismus (56) 156 (296).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As far as the contents of the Abhidhamma are concerned, they do not form a systematic philosophy, but are a special treatment of the Dhamma as found in the Sutta-Pitaka. Most of the matter is </data>
<data>psychological and logical; the fundamental doctrines mentioned or discussed are those already propounded in the suttas and, therefore, taken for granted. For a discussion of the contents see article on Abhidhamma in ERE. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apart from the Commentaries on the seven books, an exegetical work on the whole Pitaka, called the Abhidhamma Múlatíká, was written by Ananda Vanaratanatissa of the Vanavásí school in Ceylon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Tíká was evidently based on Buddhaghosa's Commentaries, but Ananda occasionally dissents from Buddhaghosa. The work was written at the request of an Elder, Buddhamitta, and was revised by Mahá Kassapa of Pulatthipura.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An Anutíká was written by Culla Dhammapála. Gv.60, 69. For details see P.L.C., pp. 210-12. The Gv. (72) also mentions Abhidhammagandhi, probably a glossary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

The brahmin exalts the knowledge of the three Vedas. The Buddha tells him that a mere babbling of Vedic runes does not make a brahmin of a man who is defiled within and is deceitful. He should have knowledge of former lives, of other worlds and of the higher lore (abhiññá) that gives cessation of birth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aggika-Bháradvája offers the Buddha the prepared meal as a fee for his teaching, but the Buddha rejects it because &quot;the Buddhas do not accept wages.&quot; The brahmin should, if he so desire, extend his hospitality to him for his holiness, and not for his ability to chant verses.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Ambalatthika-Ráhulováda Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preached by the Buddha at Ambalatthiká (near Veluvana) to Ráhula. It deals with falsehood. Like a minute drop of water is the recluse ship of those who shrink not from deliberate lying, it is thrown away, upset; it is empty and void. There is nothing evil they will not do, they run every risk, like an elephant who guards not his trunk. One should practise constant reflection, thereby abandoning all things conducive to woe, either to oneself or to others, and develop self-control and purity (M.i.414-20). Ráhula was evidently yet very young at the time of this sermon, for we find the Buddha making use of frequent similes, and pointing them out to him. According to the Cy., he was at the time only 7 years old (MA. ii. 636).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commentary says that it was preached because very young novices might be tempted to say things both proper and improper; they were likely to imagine things. This sutta is to warn Ráhula against the use of lies (MA.ii.635f.; AA.i.145; ii.547).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Ambalatthika-Ráhulováda Sutta is among the portions of scripture mentioned in the Bhábrá Edict of Asoka as being essentially worthy of study by all monks (See Mookerji: Asoka, p.119) (v.l.

He was a Brahmin of Sávatthi who, having heard the Buddha preach, entered the Order. One day, while going to the village for alms, he was disturbed in mind by an attractively dressed woman, but he recollected himself and developed insight (Thag.v.98; ThagA.i.201-2).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a former birth he had met Sumedha Buddha in the forest and had offered him a wreath of salala-flowers. Nineteen kappas ago he was born sixteen times as king, his name being Nimmita. He is probably to be identified with the Thera Vatamsakiya of the Apadána (i.174).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Abhaya&lt;/b&gt;.-Commonly called &lt;b&gt;Abhayarájakumára&lt;/b&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was the son of King &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bimbisara')"&gt;Bimbisára&lt;/a&gt; and of&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/padumavati')"&gt;Padumavatí&lt;/a&gt;, the belle of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/ujjenii')"&gt;Ujjeni&lt;/a&gt;. When the boy was seven years old, his mother sent him to the king and he grew up with the boys of the court. He first came under the influence of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/n/nigantha_nataputta')"&gt;Nigantha Nátaputta&lt;/a&gt;, who taught him a dilemma to set the &quot;Samana Gotama.&quot; In the Buddha's reply, the prince recognised the defeat of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/n/niganthaa')"&gt;Nigantha&lt;/a&gt; and the supreme Enlightenment of the Exalted One, whose disciple he then became. Later, when the king died, Abhaya was disturbed in mind, and entered the Order. On the occasion of the preaching of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/t/t1_th')"&gt;Tálacchiggalúpama Sutta&lt;/a&gt; (probably the same as S.v.455 and M.iii.169), he became a Stream-enterer and afterwards attained arahantship (Thag.26; ThagA.i.83-4 also ThagA.39. In ThagA. his mother's name does not </data>
<data>appear). The &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/am/abhayaraajakumaara_s')"&gt;Abhayarájakumára Sutta&lt;/a&gt; (M.i.392ff ) contains the dilemma episode. It also mentions that at the time the prince had a little son of whom he was evidently very fond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Samyutta Nikáya (S.v.126-8) he is stated as having visited the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddha')"&gt;Buddha&lt;/a&gt; at&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/g/gijjhakuuta')"&gt;Gijjhakúta&lt;/a&gt; and discussed with him the views of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pu/purana_kassapa')"&gt;Púrana Kassapa&lt;/a&gt;. The Buddha teaches him about the seven &lt;a href="http://www.palikanon.com/english/wtb/b_f/bojjhanga')"&gt;bojjhangas&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Vinaya (i.269), Abhaya is mentioned as having discovered &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/j/jiivaka')"&gt;Jívaka Komárabhacca&lt;/a&gt; lying on a dung-heap (cast there by the orders of his mother, the courtesan Sálávatí), and having brought him up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Anguttara Commentary (i.216), on the other hand, says that Abhaya was Jívaka's natural father.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a reward for quelling a disturbance on the frontier, Abhaya was given a skilled nautch girl by his father, Bimbisára. For seven days he enjoyed her company to the exclusion of all else, but on the seventh day she died. Disconsolate, he sought comfort from the Buddha, who assuaged his grief (DhA.iii.166-67; cf. the story of Santati).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Apadána (ii.502-4) gives the story of his past. He had been a brahmin of Hamsavatí, skilled in the Vedas; having heard the Buddha Padumuttara preach, he was converted and joined the Order, where he spent his time singing the greatness of the Buddha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Theragáthá Commentary (i.83-4) quotes, in his story, some verses in the Apadána, which in the Apadána itself are ascribed to a Thera Ketakapupphiya. They state that he offered a ketaka-flower to the Buddha Vipassí, Perhaps Ketakapupphiya was the title of another Thera, </data>
<data>whose real name was Abhaya, and hence the stories were confused (ii.449-50).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;See also Abhaya (3).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Abhaya.&lt;/b&gt;-A Licchavi of Vesáli generally (E.g., GS.i.200, n.2; ii.211, n.2; KS.v.107, n.2.), but wrongly, identified with Abhayarájakumára. On one occasion he comes with another Licchavi, Pandita Kumáraka, to Ananda in the Kútágárasálá in Vesáli, and discusses with him certain views held by Nigantha Nátaputta. Ananda teaches him the Buddha's three Ways of purification (For details see A.i.220-2). On another occasion he visits the Buddha, again at Vesáli, with the Licchavi Sálha; the latter asks the Buddha's views on purity of morals and self-mortification. The Buddha tells him of the Ariyan Way and explains its implications by various similes (See A.ii.202-4). We are not told that either of them became converts on this occasion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Abhaya&lt;/b&gt;.-A Thera. He and Tissadatta Thera are mentioned together, in several Commentaries (DA.iii.786; MA.i.234; AA.i.273; VibhA.275) as examples of persons worthy of being associated with, because of their possession of ready attention (upatthita-sati). This perhaps refers to Abhaya (1) or, more probably, to one of the three Abhayas mentioned with their titles in the Digha Commentary on the Maháparinibbána Sutta (DA.ii.530: Mahágatimba-Abhaya, Dighabhánaka-Abhaya and Tipitaka Culábhaya) in its exegesis on the word upatthita-sati.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a name="5"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;.

Abhaya.&lt;/b&gt;-King of Ceylon (414-394 B.C.). He was the eldest son of Panduvásudeva and reigned in Upatissagáma. Later, when the usurper Pandukábhaya came to the throne, he killed all his other </data>
<data>nine uncles, sparing only Abhaya, because the latter had befriended both him and his mother, Ummádacittá. (It was he who prevented Cittá from being killed at birth, Mhv.ix.3). Abhaya was made Nagaraguttika (Guardian of the City), administering the government by night; he was the first holder of that office. Mhv.ix.3, 9; x.52, 80, 105.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;7. Abhaya.&lt;/b&gt;-Personal attendant of Atthadassí Buddha. Bu.xv.19.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;8. Abhaya.&lt;/b&gt;-Eldest son of King Mutasíva of Ceylon. He renounced the succession in favour of his younger brother, Tissa, who later became known as Devánampiyatissa (MT.302).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;9. Abhaya.&lt;/b&gt;-Father of Khañjadeva. Mhv.xxiii.78.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;10. Abhaya.&lt;/b&gt;-A monk, chief of the ascetics who dwelt in the Pañca-parivenamúla monastery.

The whole book is a dictionary of synonyms, all the names given to one particular thing being grouped together and put into verse for the purpose of memorisation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Samvannaná was written by a Burmese Officer-of-State under King Kittisíhasúra (A.D. 1351), and there exists a Burmese translation of the eighteenth century. In Ceylon itself a sanna (paraphrase) and a tíká have been written, the sanna being the older and by far the more valuable work.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Abhayagiri&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A celebrated monastic establishment on the north side of Anurádhapura, consisting of a vihára and a mighty thúpa. Only the thúpa now stands. It was built by King Vattagámani Abhaya on the site of the ancient Tittháráma, 217 years, 10 months and 10 days after the founding of the Mahávihára (Mhv.xxxvii.78-83). Tradition states that when the king was fleeing from the Tamils he passed the Tittháráma on his way, and the Nigantha Giri, who then lived there, made insulting remarks about him. The king vowed, if he were returned to the throne, to build a vihára on that spot (Mhv.xxxvii.43-4); he fulfilled his vow, and the name of the vihára was a combination of his own name and of that of the Nigantha. The monastery was given in charge of the Thera Mahátissa of Kuppikala and of two other monks, Kuppikala having befriended the king in his misfortunes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vihára advanced rapidly in wealth and in power, but quite soon the monks seceded from the Mahávihára fraternity because, according to the Mahávamsa (Mhv.xxxvii.95ff), an incumbent of the Mahávihára, Mahátissa by name, was expelled from the monastery for frequenting lay families. His disciple, Bahalamassutissa, went in anger to Abhayagiri and formed a separate faction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Sinhalese chronicle, the Nikáya Sahgraha (pp.11, 12; also P.L.C.42), states that these dissentients were soon after joined by a body of Vajjiputtaka monks from the Palláráma in India, under the leadership of a teacher called Dhammaruci, and the sect which they together founded in Ceylon became known as the Dhammaruci Nikáya, with headquarters in Abhayagiri.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For quite a long while the two fraternities, that of the Mahávihára and that of the Abhayagiri, seem to have </data>
<data>lived in amity, alike enjoying the munificence of patrons (Ibid., 52f.; Mhv.xxxv.20, 57, 119-22; xxxvi.7-14). Thus, Gajabáhukagámani raised the height of Abhayuttara-thúpa (as the thúpa at Abhayagiri seems to have been called) and made the Gámanitissa-tank to be used for the cultivation of land for the maintenance of the vihara (Ibid., xxxv.119-22); Kanitthatissa built a splendid structure in the same vihára for the Thera Mahánága; it was called the Ratanapásáda (xxxvi.7, 8.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in the reign of Vohárakatissa, the Abhayagiri monks openly adopted the heretical Vaitulya Pitaka (of the Maháyánists see Mhv. trans. 259, n.2). An inquiry was held by the king with the help of his minister Kapila, the heretical books were burnt and the monks of Abhayagiri disgraced (Mhv.xxxvi.40-1).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soon afterwards, however, the heretics won over the king Mahásena to their side and destroyed the establishment of the Mahávihára, carrying away all the materials to Abhayagiri (P.L.C. 53; Mhv.xxxvii.10-16). Later, Mahásena repented of his ways, burnt the books of the Abhayagiri monks and transferred his patronage to the Mahávihára. But the Abhayagiri fraternity must soon have recovered its prestige, for we find Mahásena's successor, Sirimeghavanna, planting a bodhi tree (called Tissavasabha) (Cv.trans. i.9, n.3) in Abhayagiri and surrounding it with a stone terrace ((Cv.xxxvii.91)). A few years later both Mahánáma (409-31) and his queen became active supporters of Abhaya Giri (Cv.xxxvii.212). Dhátusena is stated to have enlarged the Abhayuttara-vihára (Cv.xxxviii.61), and Silákála is credited with several benefactions to the vihára and its bodhi tree (Cv.xli.31-2); Mahánága gave the weaver's village of Jambela to the Uttaravihára (another name for Abhayagiri; see Cv. trans. i.8, n.2; 61, n.6.); Aggabodhi I. built a </data>
<data>bathing-tank there (Cv.xlii.28), while his successor, Aggabodhi II., built the Dáthággabodhi house, so called after himself and his queen (Cv.xlii.63-5).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the monastery at Abhayagiri there seems to have been a stone image of the Buddha, referred to under various names, Silásambuddha, Kálasela, Kálasatthá, Silásatthá and Silámayamuninda. Cv.xxxix.7; xxxviii.65; 61.2; see also vv.51, 77, 87. There was also in Abhayagiri another image called the Abhiseka (q.v.). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was evidently held peculiarly sacred. Buddhadása placed a nágamani in its eye (Cv.xxxvii.123); this was soon lost, and we find Dhátusena replacing it, adorning and decorating the statue in various ways (For details see Cv.xxxviii.62ff). Silámeghavanna had it restored and redecorated and made provision for its maintenance (Cv.xliv.68). The same king, we are told, attempted to carry out a reform of the Abhayagiri monks, but this attempt ultimately brought disaster on him (Cv.xliv.75ff). Jetthatissa gave to the vihára the village of Mahádáragiri (Cv.xliv.96). Dáthopatissa built the Kappúra-parivena attached to the vihára, and also a monastery Tiputthulla, encroaching on the precincts of the Mahávihára, notwithstanding the protests of the monks belonging to the&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Latter (Cv.xlv.29ff). Aggabodhi VII, added the Sabhattudesabhoga (Cv.xlviii.64), and Mahinda II. the Mahálekha-parivena as well as the many-storeyed Ratanapásáda with its costly ornamentation (Cv.xlviii.135-40; see also Geiger's trans. 123, n.2).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sena I. built the Virankuráráma and gave it to the Mahásanghikas (Cv.l.68-9), while his consort, Sanghá, erected a dwelling house, Mahindasena (Cv.l.79), and his courtier, Uttara, yet another dwelling house, called Uttarasena, for the maintenance of which he provided. Two other courtiers, Vajira and Rakkhasa, built two dwelling houses, called </data>
<data>respectively Vajirasenaka and Rakkhasa (Cv.l.83).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the reign of Sena II. the Pamsukulika monks, who till then had evidently lived in Abhayagiri (Cv. trans. i.108, n.1), separated and formed special groups. Sanghá, queen of Udaya II., erected and endowed the building known as the Sanghasenapabbata (Cv.li.86-7). Kassapa IV. built a pásáda bearing his name and assigned to it a village (Cv.lii.13; Cv.trs. i.162, n.4), while his successor, Kassapa V., erected the Bhandiká-parivena and the Silámeghapabbata, endowing each with a village (Cv.lii.58-9).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sena III. spent 40,000 kahápanas for a stone paving round the cetiya. The Abhayagiri monks befriended both Vijayabáhu I. (then known as Kitti) and his brother, and out of gratitude Vijayabáhu built the Uttaramúla-parivena, which was probably attached to the vihara itself (Cv.lvii.18, 23).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the reign of Parakkamabáhu I., when that monarch had established himself on the throne, it is said that he tried to reform the monks of the Abhayagiri, but he found the task hopeless (Cv.lxxviii.21ff). He found that the Abhayagiri-thúpa had been destroyed by the vandalism of the Tamils, and he had it restored to a height of 160 cubits (Cv.lxxviii.98). When Anurádhapura was finally abandoned, Abhayagiri fell into ruin and decay, the monastery being completely destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is clear that even at the outset there was considerable rivalry between the monks of Abhayagiri and those of the Mahávihára. The rivalry seems originally to have been mainly personal, but it later developed into differences in doctrinal opinion. Of the exact nature of these latter we have no information, owing, chiefly, to the book-burnings carried out by pious kings in the excess of their zeal for the purity of the </data>
<data>Faith. For the same reason we are unable to ascertain what part, if any, the Abhayagiri fraternity played in literary activity. It has been suggested, however, that both the Játakatthakathá (P.L.C.124, 125) and the Sahassavatthuppakarana (P.L.C.128), another compilation of tales, were the work of the Abhayagiri monks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fa-Hsien evidently spent the two years of his stay in Ceylon with the Abhayagiri fraternity because the books he took away with him were those of the unorthodox schools. According to him, there were, at this time, 5,000 monks in Abhayagiri (Fa Hsien's Travels, 67ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the chronicles Abhayagiri is referred to under several names Abhayuttara, Abhayavihára, Abhayácala and Uttaravihára.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Aláta&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A minister and general of Angati, King of Videha. He is described as wise, smiling, a father of sons and full of experience. When Angati consulted his ministers as to ways and means of finding diversion for himself and his subjects, Aláta's counsel was that they should set out to battle with a countless host of men. The suggestion of another minister, Vijaya, was that the king should visit some samana or brahmin, and this idea it was that won the king's approval. Thereupon Aláta persuaded Angati to visit the Ájívika Guna of the Kassapa family, who evidently enjoyed Aláta's patronage. When Guna preached his doctrine that good and evil actions were alike fruitless, he was supported by Aláta, who stated that in a previous birth he had been Pingala, a cowkilling huntsman in Benares, and that he had committed many sins for which, however, he had never suffered any evil consequences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later, Angati's daughter Rujá explains that Aláta's present prosperity is the result of certain past acts of righteousness and that time will eventually bring him suffering on account of his evil deeds. Aláta himself, she says, is not aware of this because he can remember only one previous birth, while she herself can recall seven. See the Mahá Nárada-Kasappa Játaka (J.vi.222ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aláta was a previous birth of Devadatta (J.vi.255).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the text he is sometimes (E.g., pp.221, 230) also called Alátaka, perhaps for the purposes of metre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

It was in &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/vesaali')"&gt;Vesáli&lt;/a&gt; and was given to the Buddha during his last tour in that town, at the conclusion of the meal to which Ambapálí had invited him (Vin.i.231-3). But both the Buddha and the monks seem to have stayed there previously during their visits to Vesáli (thus according to D.ii.94 the Buddha was already in the grove before Ambapálí visited him; see also S.v.301, which must refer to an incident before the Buddha's last tour, because Sáriputta was still alive). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha is stated to have preached three suttas in the grove, two of them being on the value of the &lt;a href="http://www.palikanon.com/english/wtb/s_t/satipatthaana')"&gt;satipattháná&lt;/a&gt; (S.v.141ff).

In the Arunavatí Sutta it is said that he went with Sikhí to a Brahma-world and, at the Buddha's request, preached a sermon to the accompaniment of great magical powers. He proved that by using just such speech as if he were preaching to a gathering of monks, he could, standing in the Brahma-world, make his voice heard by its thousand realms (S.i.154f). The verses spoken on this occasion are, in the Theragáthá, ascribed to Abhibhúta (v.1147-8).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Anguttara Nikáya (i.226f.; AA.i.436f ) we find Ananda asking the Buddha how far Abhibhú's powers bore relation to those of a Buddha, and the Buddha replying that Abhibhú was a mere disciple, and proceeding to describe the immeasurable powers of the Tathágata.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abhibhú was a brahmin because we find him so addressed in the Arunavatí Sutta referred to above, but in the Buddhavamsa Commentary (p.202) he is spoken of as a rájaputta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Patisambhidhámagga Commentary (488f ) his story is given as an example of vikubbana-iddhi whereby a person could make himself seen in many places at the same time. We are told that he developed nílakasina, to attract to himself the attention of the world systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Thera Adhopupphiya had been a hermit in Himavá during the time of Sikhí Buddha and had offered flowers to Abhibhú. Ap.i.128-9.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Abhibhú.&lt;/b&gt;-A class of devas belonging to the Arúpa-plane (M.i.1). They live in the same plane as the Vehapphalá. In the Múlapariyáya Sutta the word is used to denote all the Asaññasattádevá. Buddhaghosa explains the word by saying abhibhaví ti Abhibhú; </data>
<data>kim abhibhaví ti ? cattáro khandhe, arúpino. They are beautiful and long-lived, and are therefore considered to be eternal and identical with Brahmá (MA.i.30).

Abhibhú.&lt;/b&gt;-The name of a Bodhisatta who obtained vivarana under Gotama. He will become the sixth Buddha after Gotama. Anágata Vamsa, p.37.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Abhibhú Sutta.&lt;/b&gt;-On the immeasurableness of a Buddha's powers.

Owing to her great beauty and charm she became known as Abhirúpá-Nandá.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the day appointed for her to select her husband, the Sákiyan youth, on whom her choice was to have fallen, died, and her parents made her leave the world against her will. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Apadána account (ii. 609) does not mention the suitor's death, but states that many sought her hand and caused great trouble, to avoid which her parents made her join the Order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even after she had entered the Order she avoided going into the Buddha's presence, being infatuated with her own beauty and fearing the Master's rebuke. In order to induce her to come to him, the Buddha directed Mahá Pajápatí to see that all the nuns came for instruction. When Nandá's turn came she sent another in her place. The Buddha refused to recognise the substitute, and Nandá was compelled to go herself. As she listened to the Buddha preaching, he, by his magic power, conjured up a beautiful woman and showed her becoming aged and fading, causing anguish to arise in Nandá's heart. At the opportune moment, the Buddha drove home the truth of the impermanence of beauty. Meditating on this topic, she later became an arahant (ThigA.81f. ; SnA.i.241-2).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two verses preached to her by the Buddha, which she made the subject of her meditations, are given in the Therígáthá (vv.19, 20).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Vipassí Buddha, Nandá had been the daughter of a wealthy burgess in the Buddha's native town of Bandhumatí. Having heard the Buddha preach she became his pious follower, and, at his death, made an offering of a golden umbrella decked with jewels to the shrine built </data>

The correct verses are found in the Apadána under the name of Abhirúpa Nandá, and agree with the story given in the text of the Therígáthá Commentary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

There was a large Buddhist community there and it is said, in the Mahávamsa (xxix.40), that on the occasion of the foundation of the Mahá Thúpa by Dutthagámani, the thera Yonaka Mahá Dhammarakkhita came to Anurádhapura from Alasanda with 30,000 monks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Milindapañha (p.327) Alasandá is mentioned in a list of places, among which are China, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/baranasi')"&gt;Benares&lt;/a&gt; and Gandhára.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere in the same book (82,83), King Milinda is mentioned as saying that he was born in a village named Kalasi in Alasandá, but he speaks of Alasandá as an island. It was about two hundred leagues from Ságala.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is generally accepted (E.g., in Questions of King Milinda, i., p.xxiii, see also CHI., p.550) that Alasandá was the name of an island in the Indus in the territory of Baktria.

In great pain he came to the carpenters and lay down before them. They removed the splinter and owing to their treatment the wound healed. The elephant, in gratitude, spent the rest of his life working for them, and, before his death, he enlisted his son, white in colour, magnificent and high-bred, in their service. One day a half-dry cake of the young one's dung was carried into the river by the flood (we are told that noble animals never dung or stale in water), and, floating down, stuck near the bathing place of the king's elephants in Benares. The royal elephants, scenting the noble animal, refused to enter the water and fled. Having discovered the reason for their behaviour, the king decided to obtain the animal for himself, and going up-stream in a raft, he saw the carpenters and the white elephant working for them. The merchants agreed to give him to the king, but the elephant refused to move till the carpenters were adequately compensated. The animal was taken in procession to the city and with his help the king became supreme ruler over India.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In course of time the Queen Consort bore a son to the king, but the king died before his birth. The Kosala king thereupon laid siege to Benares, but desisted from attack for seven days, astrologers having predicted that at the end of that time the child would be born. The men of Benares had agreed to surrender unless the baby proved to be a boy. After seven days the queen bore a son named Alínacitta, and the in habitants of </data>
<data>Benares gave battle to the Kosala king. The queen, being told that they were in danger of defeat, dressed the baby and took him to the elephant for protection. The elephant had been kept in ignorance of the king's death, lest he himself should die of a broken heart. But, on hearing the news, he sallied forth into battle and soon brought back the Kosala king as captive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alínacitta became, in due course, king over the whole of Jambudípa (J.ii.17-23). This story and that of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/samvara_jat_462')"&gt;Samvara Játaka&lt;/a&gt; were both related in connection with a monk who had become faint-hearted. For details see &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/samvara')"&gt;Samvara&lt;/a&gt;. The elephant of the Játaka was the faint-hearted monk and the father-elephant was Sáriputta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This Játaka also was related by the Buddha, with reference to the Elder &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/r/radha')"&gt;Rádha&lt;/a&gt; whom Sáriputta had taken under his special spiritual protection and guidance, in gratitude for a ladleful of food that Rádha, as layman, had once given him. The Buddha pointed out that this was not the first time that Sáriputta had shown his gratitude (DhA.ii.106).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

He was a nihilist who believed in neither good nor evil. In Tibetan sources he is stated to have taught that all beings must dwell in Samsara for 84,000 mahákalpas before they come to an end; nothing can prevent that (Rockhill: 103-4). The answer Ajita gave to Ajátasattu is given elsewhere (E.g., S.iii.207; M.i.515) as being the view of a typical sophist. His name is often introduced into the stereotyped list of the six teachers even where the views they are alleged to have expressed do not coincide with those attributed to Ajita in the Sámaññaphala Sutta. E.g., S.iv.398, where he is represented as talking about the rebirths of his adherents - he who denied rebirth. In A.i.286 he seems to have been confused with &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/makkhali_gosala')"&gt;Makkhali Gosála&lt;/a&gt;. He was called Kesakambali because he wore a blanket of human hair, which is described as being the most miserable garment. It was cold in cold weather, hot in the hot, evil-smelling and uncouth (DA.i.144; MA.i.422-3).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahabodhi_jat_528')"&gt;Mahábodhi Játaka&lt;/a&gt; the Buddha had already refuted Ajita's view in previous births (J.v.246). Ajita was </data>
<data>evidently much older in years than the Buddha, for we find &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/pasenadi')"&gt;Pasenadi&lt;/a&gt;, in the early years of his friendship with the Buddha, telling him that he was a young novice compared with Ajita. S.i.68.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/me_mu/milindapanha')"&gt;Milinda-pañha&lt;/a&gt; the king says that he had visited a teacher named Ajitakesakambala. This cannot possibly refer to our Ajita; the reference is probably to a teacher belonging to the same school of thought (&quot;There is neither fruit nor result of good or evil karma,&quot; p.4. His views are given on p.25 without mention being made of his name. But see note 2 to the Mil. trans., p.8.). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;References to ascetics wearing hair garments are found in several passages of the Pali canon. D.i.167; M.i.77, 238; A.i.240; for a discussion of Ajita's views see Barua: Pre-Buddhistic Indian Philosophy, pp.287ff. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Inda.&lt;/b&gt;-Given in the Átánátiya Sutta as the name of the ninety-one sons of Dhatarattha, king of the Gandhabbas. They are represented as being of great strength and followers of the Buddha (D.iii.197).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The name is also given as that of the ninety-one sons of Virúlha, king of the Kumbhandas (D.iii.198); of Virúpakkha, king of the Nágas (p.199); and of Kuvera, king of the Yakkhas (p.202). Further on in the same sutta, Inda is mentioned with Soma, Varuna and others as a Yakkha, to whom appeal should be made by disciples of the Buddha when needing protection (p.204). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Mahá Samaya Sutta (D.ii.257f), also, Inda is mentioned as the name of the Sons of the Regent Gods of the Four Quarters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Inda&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Páli equivalent of the Vedic Indra. He is referred to only very seldom in the Nikáyas. In one such passage (D.i.244-5) he is mentioned with &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/soma')"&gt;Soma&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/va/varuna')"&gt;Varuna&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/i_/iisaana')"&gt;Isána&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/pajapati')"&gt;Pajápati&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/brahmaloka')"&gt;Brahmá&lt;/a&gt;, Mahiddi and Yáma, as a god whom brahmins invoke and pray to, for union with Brahma after death. In another place, he is described as being seated in the company of Pajápati and other gods in the Assembly Hall, named Sudhamma. Two of his companions, having listened to the admonition of Gopaka, became disciples of the Buddha and, as a result, far surpassed in glory Inda and his other companion devas. In the same context, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/va/vaasava')"&gt;Vásava&lt;/a&gt;, ruler of the gods, identified with </data>
<data>&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sakka')"&gt;Sakka&lt;/a&gt;, is addressed by &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/g/gopaka')"&gt;Gopaka&lt;/a&gt; as &quot;Indra.&quot; (Ibid., ii.274; in M.i.140; J.v.411 and vi.568, he is mentioned with Brahmá and Pajápati; in J.iv.568, 571 is a list in which Inda appears with Brahmá, Pajápati, Soma, Yama and Vessavana).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the time of the compilation of the Nikáyas, the hold of the Vedic god Indra on the mind of the people seems to have become greatly weakened and Indra has been merged in Sakka, although, strictly speaking, Indra and Sakka are quite different conceptions. (See Sakka).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the later literature, however, particularly in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/j/jaatakatthakathaa')"&gt;Játakatthakathá&lt;/a&gt;, Indra's name occurs frequently, but always as identified or identifiable with Sakka. In one place at least (J.v.115) the scholiast says, &quot;Sakko ti Indo.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/ayakuuta_jat_347')"&gt;Ayakúta Játaka&lt;/a&gt; (J.iii.146), for example, Indra is called king of the gods (devárájá) in one verse, and in the next he is identified with Maghavá, husband of Sujá, and described as &quot;devánam indo.&quot; Indra is most revered of the gods (Sn.vs.316). He is free from old age and death, and is, therefore, the happiest type of king (Sn.vs.515), a condition that could be attained by sacrifice (Sn.vs.517). Alone he conquered the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/asura')"&gt;Asuras&lt;/a&gt; (J.iv.347; he is therefore called Asurinda and Asurádhipa ; see Asura). He is spoken of, as the lord of victors (jayatam pati) (J.v.322), and he is the embodiment of the greatest valour (Mhv.xxx.10).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes he visits the earth in disguise (J.v.33). He is also represented as punishing people guilty of heinous </data>
<data>crimes; with his thunderbolt he smites them (DhA.iv.105).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scene of his pleasures is in the Nandana pleasance (J.v.158), and his is the ideal enjoyment of pleasure, surrounded by friends (J.v.506; Sn.v.679) and by adoring wives (J.vi.240). The gods of Távatimsa are called Inda-purohitá, because, with Inda as their chief, they seek to promote the welfare of gods and men (J.vi.127; the Távatimsa gods are also described as being Sa-Indaká, ibid., 568). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inda is called Tidivapuravara and Suravaratara (D.iii.176). His capital is Masakkasára (J.vi.271; but see Amarávatí).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the sacrifice the palásayatthi (Butea shoot), used by the sacrificing priest, is described as Indra's right hand (J.vi.212).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indra's gotta, or clan, is the Kosiya (J.vi.501) ; he is called Vatrabhú in reference to his victory over Vatra (Skt. Vrtra) (J.v.153), and mention is made of his thunderbolt, the Indavajira (J.i.354) ; thus he is called Vajirahattha (D.ii.259; DA.ii.689). The sound of Indra's thunderbolt striking its victim, surpasses all other sounds by its intensity, its volume and its fearfulness (UdA.67); no obstruction can stop the progress of Indra's Vajira and it never misses its mark; it is avirajjhanaka (VibhA.333).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After his victory over the Asuras, images of him were made (Indapatimá) and placed round Cittakúta to frighten the Asuras away, in case they attempted to retrieve their lost honour (J.vi.125-6; see also J.i.203-4; DhA.i.280).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be born into the company of Indra (Indasahavyatá) is considered very fortunate (E.g., J.v.411).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A species of coral red insect (kimi), noticeable after rain, are called Indagopaká. The reason for this name is not clear. (See Brethren, p.18 n., and N.P.D ).&lt;/p&gt;</data>
<data>&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Udána Commentary (p.75, n.12) seems to give Vidojá as an epithet of Indra; but this is probably a wrong reading, the correct one being, as in some MSS., &quot;Visamucchájapam japanti.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inda was a special protector of cows, and when men began to kill these creatures he visited his wrath on them.

She then repeated them to the five hundred women of Udena's palace, chief of whom was Sámávatí. In order to emphasise to her audience the fact that she was reporting the Buddha's words and not her own, she prefaced each sutta with the phrase quoted above. There was no need to describe any special circumstances in which the suttas were preached, because they were familiar to Khujjuttará's audience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Rájagaha Council, Ananda repeated the suttas to the Assembly and they were gathered into this collection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Itivuttaka is also the name given to one of the nine divisions (anga) into which the Buddha's preaching is divided and it is defined as follows: vuttam h'etam Bhagavatá ti ádinayappavattá dasuttarasatam suttantá Itivuttakam ti veditabbam (DA.i.24).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the scholiast of the Kummásapinda Játaka (J.iii.409; l.21)), the Itivuttaka is mentioned in the plural (Itivuttakesu) and a sutta is quoted from it, extolling the virtues of generosity. Perhaps, the Itivuttaka was compiled as a result of a critical study of the authentic teachings of the Buddha, considered in a certain light and made for a specific purpose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

In order to hide the deed from her husband, she took him to the monastery to hear the Buddha preach. Some relatives of hers came to the house and discovering what had happened, released the servant. She went to the monastery where her mistress was listening to the Buddha's sermon and proclaimed aloud the wrong done to her. The Buddha, thereupon, pointed out the folly of doing evil in the hope that it would not be found out. We are told that both the woman and her husband became Sotápanna at the end of the sermon. The servant was set free (DhA.iii.486-7).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Ananda was succeeded by his son Cúlábhaya and he by his younger sister Sívalí. After Sívalí had reigned for four months, Ilanaga dethroned her and became king himself. In the first year of his reign he incurred the displeasure of the powerful Lambakannas and was deprived of his throne and taken captive. It is said that the king was rescued from prison by his state elephant and that he escaped to Rohana. Three years later he gave battle to the Lambakannas at Kapallakkhanda and massacred most of them. He had the noses and toes of the rest cut off as punishment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was succeeded by his son Candamukha Siva. To his state elephant, who had helped him, he gave the tract of land called Hatthibhoga. During his exile in Rohana, Ilanaga built two tanks, the Tissa and the Dúra, and restored the Nágamahávihára, which he gave to Mahápaduma, thera of Tuládhára, who had preached to him the Kapi Játaka.

When the Buddha was staying at Indakúta, the yakkha questioned him as to how the soul finds its material counterpart. The Buddha, in reply, described how the embryo evolved into its final shape by the laws of physical growth and not by a soul's fiat (S.i.206).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buddhaghosa says (SA.i.231) that the yakkha was an animist (puggalavádin).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Indaka&lt;/b&gt;.-A deva. He had been a youth who gave a spoonful of food to Anuruddha. In consequence he was born in Távatimsa as a deva of great power and majesty. When the Buddha went to Távatimsa to preach the Abhidhamma, in the assembly of the gods who gathered there, those of lesser powers had to yield place to their superiors. Thus Ankura (q.v.), who, at the start, was very near the Buddha, found himself twelve leagues away. But not so Indaka; the power of his merit was very great and no deva was mighty enough to displace him; he had been lucky in the recipient of his gift. Ankura's generosity, much more lavish than Indaka's, had been bestowed on men who were not holy. Such was the explanation the Buddha gave in the assembly of the gods, on seeing the discrepancy between the positions of the two devas, Indaka surpassing the other in ten qualities. (Pv.pp.27f; PvA.136-8; DhA.iii.219-20; 80-1).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one place, in the Petavatthu (p.28, v.69), Indaka is called a yakkha, but the Commentary (p.139) says it means deva-putta. He is, therefore, different from Indaka (1).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Indaka Sutta&lt;/b&gt;.-Contains the question asked by Indaka and the Buddha's reply.

The further question is asked as to whom, when given, does a gift bear much fruit. To the virtuous, irrespective of class, says the Buddha, and he instances the case of a youth skilled in war as opposed to one who is untrained and unskilled, no matter what his social status. The Buddha proceeds to describe the qualities which are possessed by the virtuous man (S.i.98f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commentary (SA.i.129f) describes this interview as a public one, taking place before a large audience, among whom are teachers of rival schools, &quot;scratching the ground with their feet.&quot; Their fame had suffered owing to the popularity of the Buddha and they had represented him as exhorting the people to give only to himself and to his followers.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Ísána&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the chief devas.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/t/tevijja_s')"&gt;Tevijja Sutta&lt;/a&gt; (D.i.244) he is mentioned with &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/i_/inda')"&gt;Indra&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/soma')"&gt;Soma&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/va/varuna')"&gt;Varuna&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/pajapati')"&gt;Pajápati&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/brahmaloka')"&gt;Brahmá&lt;/a&gt;, as being invoked by the brahmins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was in the battle of the devas against the Asuras and led a section of the deva host. Indra tells the devas that if, during the struggle, they felt faint-hearted, they should look at the crest of his own banner or at that of Pajápati, Varuna or &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/i_/iisaana')"&gt;Ísána&lt;/a&gt;, and their fear would disappear (S.i.219).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the assembly of the gods, Ísána gets the fourth seat next to Varuna. He is in beauty and longevity equal to Indra (SA.i.262).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ísána is an older name for Rudra (Siva) (Böthlinck and Roth: Wörterbuch). The conception of him had so far changed by the time of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddhagosa')"&gt;Buddhaghosa&lt;/a&gt; that in Buddhaghosa's accounts he is given a seat near&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sakka')"&gt;Sakka&lt;/a&gt; and inferior to his. Perhaps he was one of the thirty-three gods of&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/t/taavatimsa')"&gt;Távatimsa&lt;/a&gt; (KS.i.281, n.4).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Questions are asked as to what makes for lordship among men, what is the supreme commodity, etc., and the answer is that power of command it is which brings lordship and that women are the supreme commodity, etc. S.i.43.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Indriya Sutta.-The monk possessed of six qualities - the five indriyas (saddhá, etc.), and the freedom of mind brought about by the destruction of the ásavas - is worthy of offerings, etc. A.iii.281.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Indriya Sutta.-Where control of the faculties of sense (indriya) is not found, morality ceases to exist and, in consequence, concentration, insight into and knowledge of reality as it is, detachment and the feeling of revulsion, insight into liberation - these also cease to exist. When such control is present all the other qualities are also present. A.iii.360.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Indriya Sutta.-If a monk, observing the rise and fall in the faculties of sense, is repelled by them and lusts not for them, the knowledge arises in him that he is free and that for him there is no hereafter. Thus would he be perfect in faculty. S.iv.140.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4. Indriya Sutta.-The five indriyas (saddhá, etc.), are called the Path that goes to the Uncompounded (asankhata). S.iv.361.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;5. Indriya Sutta.-The five indriyas (saddhá, etc.), when practised with singleness of heart, dispassion, and cessation that conduces to abandonment, form the Path leading to the Uncompounded. S.iv.365.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;6. Indriya Sutta.-Anuruddha tells his colleagues that by cultivating the four satipatthánas, he knows, as they really are, the nature of the minds of other beings, of other persons (indriyaparopariyatti).

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Isipatana&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Isipatana.&lt;/b&gt;-An open space near &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/baranasi')"&gt;Benares&lt;/a&gt;, the site of the famous Migadáya or Deer Park. It was eighteen leagues from &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/uruvelaa')"&gt;Uruvelá&lt;/a&gt;, and when &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/g/gotama')"&gt;Gotama&lt;/a&gt; gave up his austere penances his friends, the&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/pancavaggiya')"&gt;Pañcavaggiya&lt;/a&gt; monks, left him and went to Isipatana (J.i.68). After his Enlightenment the Buddha, leaving Uruvela, joined them in Isipatana, and it was there that he preached his first sermon, the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/dhammacakkappavattana')"&gt;Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta&lt;/a&gt;, on the full-moon day of Ásálha. Vin.i.10f.; on this occasion 80 kotis of Brahmas and innumerable gods attained the comprehension of the Truth (Mil.30); (130 kotis says Mil.350). The Lal. (528) gives details of the stages of this journey. The Buddha, having no money with which to pay the ferryman, crossed the Ganges through the air. When &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bimbisara')"&gt;Bimbisára&lt;/a&gt; heard of this, he abolished the toll for ascetics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There, also, the Buddha spent his first rainy season (BuA., p.3).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All the Buddhas preach their first sermon at the Migadáya in Isipatana; it is one of the four avijahitatthánáni (unchanging spots), the others being the bodhi-pallanka, the spot at the gate of Sankassa, where the Buddha first touches the earth on his return from &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/t/taavatimsa')"&gt;Távatimsa&lt;/a&gt;, and the site of the bed in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/g/gandhakuti')"&gt;Gandhakuti&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/j/jetavana')"&gt;Jetavana&lt;/a&gt; (BuA.247; DA.ii.424).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Isipatana is mentioned by the Buddha as </data>
<data>one of the four places of pilgrimage which his devout followers should visit (D.ii.141).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Isipatana was so-called because sages, on their way through the air (from the Himalayas), alight here or start from here on their aerial flight (isayo ettha nipatanti uppatanti cáti-Isipatanam).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Migadáya was so-called because deer were allowed to roam about there unmolested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pacceka Buddhas, having spent seven days in contemplation in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/g/gandhamaadana')"&gt;Gandhamádana&lt;/a&gt;, bathe in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/anotatta')"&gt;Anotatta&lt;/a&gt; Lake and come to the habitations of men through the air, in search of alms. They descend to earth at Isipatana (MA.i.387; AA.i.347 adds that sages also held the uposatha at Isipatana).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the Pacceka Buddhas come to Isipatana from &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/n/nandamulapabbhara')"&gt;Nandamúlaka-pabbhára&lt;/a&gt; (MA.ii.1019; PsA.437-8).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several other incidents connected with the Buddha, besides the preaching of the first sermon, are mentioned as having taken place in Isipatana. Here it was that one day at dawn &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/y/yasa')"&gt;Yasa&lt;/a&gt; came to the Buddha and became an arahant (Vin.i.15f). It was at Isipatana, too, that the rule was passed prohibiting the use of sandals made of talipot leaves (Vin.i.189). On another occasion when the Buddha was staying at Isipatana, having gone there from &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/r/raajagaha')"&gt;Rájagaha&lt;/a&gt;, he instituted rules forbidding the use of certain kinds of flesh, including human flesh (Vin.i.216ff.; the rule regarding human flesh was necessary because &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/suppiyaa')"&gt;Suppiyá&lt;/a&gt; made broth out of her own flesh for a sick monk). Twice, while the Buddha was at Isipatana, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/maara')"&gt;Mára&lt;/a&gt; visited him but had </data>
<data>to go away discomfited (S.i.105f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides the Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta mentioned above, several other suttas were preached by the Buddha while staying at Isipatana, among them  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;the Pañca Sutta (S.iii.66f), &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;the Rathakára or Pacetana Sutta (A.i.110f), &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;the two Pása Suttas (S.i.105f), &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;the Samaya Sutta (A.iii.320ff), &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;the Katuviya Sutta (A.i.279f.), &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;a discourse on the Metteyyapañha of the Paráyana (A.iii.399f), and &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;the Dhammadinna Sutta (S.v.406f), preached to the distinguished layman &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/dhammadinna')"&gt;Dhammadinna&lt;/a&gt;, who came to see the Buddha.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the most eminent members of the Sangha seem to have resided at Isipatana from time to time; among recorded conversations at Isipatana are several between &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/saariputta')"&gt;Sáriputta&lt;/a&gt; and&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/maha_kotthita')"&gt;Mahákotthita&lt;/a&gt; (S.ii.112f;iii.167f;iv.162f; 384ff), and one between Mahákotthita and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/citta')"&gt;Citta-Hatthisáriputta&lt;/a&gt; (A.iii.392f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mention is made, too, of a discourse in which several monks staying at Isipatana tried to help &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/channa')"&gt;Channa&lt;/a&gt; in his difficulties (S.iii.132f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahavamsa')"&gt;Mahávamsa&lt;/a&gt;, there was a large community of monks at Isipatana in the second century B.C. For, we are told that at the foundation ceremony of the Mahá Thúpa in Anurádhapura, twelve thousand monks were present from Isipatana led by the Elder Dhammasena (Mhv.xxix.31).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/h/hiuen_tsang')"&gt;Hiouen Thsang&lt;/a&gt; (Beal: Records of the </data>
<data>Western World, ii.45ff ) found, at Isipatana, fifteen hundred monks studying the Hínayána. In the enclosure of the Sangháráma was a vihára about two hundred feet high, strongly built, its roof surmounted by a golden figure of the mango. In the centre of the vihára was a life-size statue of the Buddha turning the wheel of the Law. To the south-west were the remains of a stone stupa built by &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/asoka')"&gt;Asoka&lt;/a&gt;. The Divy. (389-94) mentions Asoka as intimating to Upagupta his desire to visit the places connected with the Buddha's activities, and to erect thupas there. Thus he visited Lumbiní, Bodhimúla, Isipatana, Migadáya and Kusinagara; this is confirmed by Asoka's lithic records, e.g. Rock Edict, viii.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In front of it was a stone pillar to mark the spot where the Buddha preached his first sermon. Near by was another stupa on the site where the Pañcavaggiyas spent their time in meditation before the Buddha's arrival, and another where five hundred Pacceka Buddhas entered Nibbána. Close to it was another building where the future Buddha Metteyya received assurance of his becoming a Buddha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hiouen Thsang quotes the Nigrodhamiga Játaka (J.i.145ff) to account for the origin of the Migadáya. According to him the Deer Park was the forest gifted by the king of Benares of the Játaka, where the deer might wander unmolested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Udapána Játaka (J.ii.354ff ) there was a very ancient well near Isipatana which, in the Buddha's time, was used by the monks living there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In past ages Isipatana sometimes retained its own name, E.g., in the time of Phussa Buddha (Bu.xix.18), Dhammadassí (BuA.182) and Kassapa (BuA.218). Kassapa was born there (ibid., 217).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But more often Isipatana was known by different names (for these names see under those of the different Buddhas). Thus </data>
<data>in Vipassí's time it was known as Khema-uyyána. It is the custom for all Buddhas to go through the air to Isipatana to preach their first sermon. Gotama, however, walked all the way, eighteen leagues, because he knew that by so doing he would meet Upaka, the Ajivaka, to whom he could be of service (DA.ii.471).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Isipatana is identified with the modern Saranath, six miles from Benares. Cunningham (Arch. Reports, i. p. 107) found the Migadáya represented by a fine wood, covering an area of about half a mile, extending from the great tomb of Dhammek on the north to the Chaukundi mound on the south.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Isipatana.&lt;/b&gt;-A monastery built by Parakkamabáhu I. in the suburb Rájavesibhujanga, of Pulatthipura. Cv.lxxviii.79; but see lxxiii.151-5 and Cv.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Iccánanagala&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A brahmin village in the Kosala country. It was while staying in the woodland thicket (vanasanda) there that the Buddha preached the Ambattha Sutta (D.i.87). From this sutta, the village would seem to have been near Pokkharasádi's domain of Ukkatthá. It was the residence of &quot;Mahásála&quot; brahmins. The Sutta Nipáta (p.115) (which spells the name as Icchánankala) mentions several eminent brahmins who lived there, among them Cankí, Tárukkha, Pokkarasáti, Jánussoni and Todeyya. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were also two learned youths, Vásettha and Bharadvája at Icchánankala, who, finding it impossible to bring their discussion to a conclusion, sought the Buddha, then staying in the village. Their interview with the Buddha is recorded in the Vásettha Sutta (Ibid., 115ff.; M ii.146ff). Buddhaghosa (SnA.ii.462) says that learned brahmins of Kosala, deeply versed in the Vedas, were in the habit of meeting together from time to time (once in six months, MA.ii.796) at Icchánangala in order to recite the Vedas and discuss their interpretation. These brahmins met at Ukkatthá, under Pokkharasáti, when they wished to cleanse their caste (játisodhanattham), and at Icchánankala in order to revise their Vedic hymns (mante sodhetu-kámá), MA.ii.796.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Samyutta Nikáya (v.325), the Buddha once stayed for three months in the jungle thicket at Icchánangala, in almost complete solitude, visited only by a single monk who brought him his food. But from the Anguttara Nikáya (iii.30f.; cf. iii.341 and iv.340ff), it would appear that the Buddha was not left to enjoy the solitude which he desired, for we are told that the residents of Icchánangala, having heard of the Buddha's visit, came to him in large numbers and created a </data>
<data>disturbance by their shouts. The Buddha had to send Nágita, who was then his personal attendant, to curb the enthusiasm of his admirers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Illisa&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A setthi of Rájagaha. At the opening of the story the king of Benares is mentioned, but it is to Rájagaha that Sakka comes (see p.350), so Rájagaha was evidently Illisa's residence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was lame and hunch-backed and also had a squint. He was an infidel and a miser, never giving away any of his wealth nor enjoying it himself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For seven generations his ancestors had been generous, but Illisa burnt down the almonry and drove away the poor from his house.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once, at the sight of a yokel drinking, with a piece of dried fish as a relish, Illisa was sorely tempted to drink himself. For a long time he fought the temptation, but he sickened with longing, and having sent a slave with a single penny to the tavern, he got some toddy; he ordered the slave to put the jar of spirits in a thicket by the riverside so that he might drink unseen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile Illisa's father, who had been born as Sakka, having learnt, as a result of investigations, that his son had become a miser, came down to earth to wean him from his folly. Assuming in every detail the form of Illisa, he entered the king's palace and offered all the wealth of Illisa to the king. On the offer being refused, he went to Illisa's house and gave orders to the servants to throw open all the treasure chambers and give the wealth to the poor. The servants took the disguised Sakka to be Illisa himself, and Illisa's wife, believing her husband's sudden generosity to be due to his drunkenness, acquiesced in the instructions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among those who profited by this unexpected good fortune was a countryman who had been Illisa's carriage-driver. Filling the carriage with seven things of value, he set out along the road, passing by the thicket wherein Illisa lay drinking. The man was singing Illisa's </data>
<data>praises, and at mention of his name Illisa came out, and seeing the man going away with his belongings tried to stop him. But the man, not recognising him, knocked him down and went on his way. Illisa hurried home but was turned out of his house by the porters, and at length he sought the king. The king, having heard his story, made enquiries and discovered the existence of two Illisas, alike in every respect, down to the minutest detail, even to a wart on the head.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not even Illisa's wife and children, not even his barber, could distinguish him from the second Illisa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bereft of all hope, Illisa swoons, Sakka reveals himself and tells Illisa that the wealth is really his and not Illisa's, the latter not having earned it. He urges Illisa to do good and practise generosity, or he would die, smitten by Indra's thunderbolt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Illisa, taking heed of the warning, becomes a virtuous man (J.i.349ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Isidatta&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Isidatta.&lt;/b&gt;-A thera. He was the son of a caravan guide at Vaddhagáma (v.l. Velugáma) in Avanti. By correspondence he became the unseen friend of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/citta')"&gt;Citta-gahapati&lt;/a&gt; of Macchikásanda. The latter once sent him a letter regarding the excellences of the Buddha, and Isidatta, being pleased with the account given of the Buddha's religion, entered the Order under &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/maha_kaccaana')"&gt;Mahá-Kaccána&lt;/a&gt; and in due course became an arahant. Later, with Mahá-Kaccána's leave, he visited the Buddha in the Majjhimadesa and was warmly received by him (ThagA.i.238). A verse uttered by Isidatta, in response to the Buddha's enquiry regarding his welfare, is recorded in the Therágáthá (v.120).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Isidatta had been a householder in the time of Vipassí Buddha and once, having seen the Buddha walking along the street and being pleased with his demeanour, he gave him an ámoda-fruit (ThagA. loc. cit.). He is, probably, identical with Amodapaliya of the Apadána (ii.447).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Samyutta Nikáya (iv.283-8, also AA.i.210), Isidatta was once staying with a number of senior monks at Macchikásanda in the Ambátaka grove. Citta-gahapati invited the monks to a meal. On this occasion Citta asked a question regarding the Buddha's teaching on the diversity of the elements. The chief Elder, being unable to answer, remained silent. Isidatta, though the most junior of the whole company, obtained the chief Elder's permission, and answered the question to the satisfaction of Citta. Citta likewise asked questions regarding various views, such as the infinity of the world, etc. At the end of the discourse, Citta discovered, by accident, that the Elder who had preached to him was none other </data>
<data>than his unseen friend, Isidatta. Delighted with the discovery, he invited Isidatta to spend his time at a Macchikásanda, promising to provide him with all requisites. But that same day Isidatta left Macchikásanda and never returned. Because, says Buddhaghosa (AA.i.210), he did not wish to stay after having been recognised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Isidatta.&lt;/b&gt;-An equerry or chamberlain (thapati) of Pasenadi, King of Kosala. Isidatta is always mentioned with Purána. Their duty was to look after the ladies of the king's harem when these went riding the elephant into the park. This often brought them into close contact with the ladies, and they confessed to the Buddha that it was difficult not to have evil thoughts regarding them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Isidatta and Purána were once at Sádhuka' on some business (their own property, according to Buddhaghosa, SA.i.215). They heard that the Buddha was having a robe made before starting on his rounds and they waited for an opportunity to talk to him. When the opportunity came they followed the Buddha and told him how glad they always were when he was near them and how sad when he was away on tour. The Buddha preaches to them the glory of the homeless life and urges them to put forth energy. He speaks very appreciatively of their loyalty to him and to his religion and congratulates them on the possession of virtuous qualities, such as sharing all their goods with holy men, a rare quality (S.v.348-52; Netti. 134f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Samyutta Commentary (i.215), Isidatta was a Sakadágámí and Purána a Sotápanna.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Dhammacetiya Sutta (M.ii.123f), Pasenadi tells the Buddha how impressed he is by the reverence Isidatta and Purána show for the Buddha and his teachings. &quot;They are my carriage-builders,&quot; says the king, &quot;and they depend on me for their livelihood and all their </data>
<data>honours, yet these men do not serve me as whole-heartedly as they do the Lord.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the king spent the night in a cramped little house. Isidatta and Purána, who were with him, having spent the best part of the night in discussing the Doctrine, lay down to rest with their heads in the direction in which they thought the Buddha to be, and their feet towards the king!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Isidatta was the uncle of the woman-disciple Migasálá, whose father was Purána.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Purána is described as a brahmacári, but not Isidatta, yet, after death, they were both born in Tusita. Migasálá asks Ananda how it was that people of different characters could have the same rebirth. A.iii.348f.; v.138f., 143f. From MA.ii.756, it would appear as if Isidatta was the brahmacári. The word cannot here mean &quot;celibate,&quot; for Purána must have had a wife because Migasálá calls him her father (pitá).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Isidatta is mentioned by the Buddha among those who had the six qualities that brought realisation of immortality - unwavering loyalty to the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha, Ariyan virtue, wisdom and liberation (A.iii.451).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Anágata Vamsa (v.58) says that when the future Buddha Metteyya leaves the household life, eighty-four thousand others, led by Isidatta and Purána, will accompany him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Isidatta.&lt;/b&gt;-King of Soreyya. Anomadassí Buddha preached to him and to eighty thousand of his followers. They all became arahants. BuA.143-4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Isidatta.&lt;/b&gt;-One of the three leaders of the monks in Ceylon during the time that Bráhmanatissa-cora laid waste the land. The other two were Cúlasíva and Mahásona. For the story connected with them see s.v. Mahásona.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Indriyabhávaná Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preached at Kajangalá in the Mukheluvana. When a young brahmin, Uttara, pupil of Párápariya, visits the Buddha, the Buddha asks him what was the teaching of Párásariya on the development of the indriyas. It is that a man should neither see forms with his eyes, nor hear words with his ears, says Uttara. Whereupon the Buddha retorts that in that case the deaf and the blind have reached development. When Uttara sits silent and discomfited, Ananda intervenes and begs the Buddha to expound his teaching on the subject. The Buddha agrees and preaches this sutta, with a variety of similes (M.iii.298-302).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Theragáthá Commentary (ii.17) we are told that the thera Párápariya (probably identical with Párásariya mentioned above) was taught the Indriyabhávana Sutta by the Buddha. He learnt it by heart, and pondering over its meaning, attained insight. The Theragáthá (vv.726ff) gives a summary of the musings of Párápariya which lead to his attainment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only connection between the Sutta and this summary is identity of subject, not identity of treatment. Perhaps Párápariya's musings were only prompted by the sutta and were independent of its actual words.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

So she went to the Himálaya and having spread a bed of fragrant flowers, lay thereon and sang. Vessavana's nephew, a yakkha, Punnaka, heard her and offered himself as her husband. She took him to her father who agreed to give him Irandatí, if he could bring Vidhura's heart. When Punnaka fulfilled this condition, as described in the Vidhura-pandita Játaka, Irandatí became his wife. J.vi.263-327.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Near Nárada's hermitage was a river, on the banks of which courtesans used to sit, tempting men. Nárada saw one of these courtesans, and becoming enamoured of her, forsook his meditations and pined away for lack of food. Káladevala, being aware of this, tried to wean him from his desires. Nárada, however, refused to be comforted, even when his colleagues, Sálissara, Mendissara and Pabbatissara admonished him. In the end Sarabhanga himself was summoned and Nárada, having listened to the words of his Master, was persuaded to give up his passion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to a backsliding monk. He went about for alms with his teachers and instructors but, being their junior, he received very little attention. Dissatisfied with his food and treatment, he sought his wife of former days. She provided him with every comfort and gradually tempted him with the desire to become a householder again. When the monk's fellow-celibates discovered his wish, they took him to the Buddha who preached to him this Játaka, showing that in a past life, too, he had been sorely tempted by the same woman. Nárada was identified with the backsliding monk and the courtesan with the wife of his lay-days (J.iii.461-9).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha is stated on this occasion to have preached also the Kandina Játaka (J.i.153ff), the Rádha Játaka (J.i.495ff), the Ruhaka Játaka (J.ii.113ff), the Kanavera Játaka (J.iii.58ff), the Asanka Játaka (J.iii.248ff) and the Alambusá Játaka (J.v.152ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Indriya Játaka is also referred to in the Kámavilápa Játaka (J.ii.443ff), but the connection between the two </data>

He had a young elephant which he had reared; being headstrong and rough in speech, he would not listen to the warning of his teacher, the Bodhisatta, that it was dangerous to have such a pet. Once while the hermits were away the elephant was seized with a frenzy, and when his master returned it killed him (J.ii.41-3). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the man's name was Kosiya, because we are told (J.vi.501) that Inda was of the Kosiyagotta. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kátiyána, who was a brahmin of the Kosiyagotta (ThagA.i.450), is addressed in a verse (416) of the Theragáthá as  Indasagotta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

It was built by Devánampiyatissa on the spot where the prince Arittha dwelt with his five hundred followers after having received their ordination from Mahinda (Mhv.xx.14; xix.66). The building of this monastery was the seventh of the great tasks performed by Devánampiyatissa (Mhv.xx.20).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the eight saplings from the Bodhi-tree at Anurádhapura was planted at Issarasamanáráma (Mhv.xix.61; Mbv.162).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Candamukha Siva built a tank near Manikáragámaka and gave it for the use of the vihára (Mhv.xxxv.47), while Vasabha built in the monastery an uposatha-hall (Mhv.xxxv.87) and Voháraka Tissa constructed a wall round it (Mhv.xxxvi.36). Kassapa I. restored the buildings and enlarged the grounds. He also bought villages which he presented to the monastery for its maintenance. He had two daughters, Bodhí and Uppalavanná, and he gave their names and his own to the vihára. When the king wished to hand over the vihára to the Theraváda monks they refused to accept it, fearing the reproach of the people that it was the work of a parricide. Then the king dedicated it to the image of the Buddha and the monks accepted it saying that it belonged to their Master (Cv.xxxix.10-14; see also below).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Mahávamsa Tíká (pp. 407 and 652), the vihára was also called Kassapagiri, probably after its restoration by Kassapa I., mentioned above.' See also Kassapagiri. See also Cv. Trs.i.43, n.7, and Ep. Zeyl. i.31ff., where the vihára is called &quot;Isuramenu-.Bo-Upulvan-Kasubgiri&quot; in an inscription of Mahinda IV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It had originally been called Issarasamana because of its association with the five hundred noblemen (issaradáraká) </data>
<data>who joined the Order with Arittha (MT.416). The Tíká adds (607) that Sáliya, son of Dutthagámani, enlarged the vihára out of the tribute brought to him by the men of his tributary villages to the south of Anurádhapura. He used to observe the uposatha on fast days at the vihára and spend the day in the Mahindaguhá there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Samantapásádiká (i.100) the vihára is called Issaranimmána.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Vepacitti entered the hermitage by the principal gate, keeping his shoes on and his sword by his side, thereby insulting the seers and committing sin. Sakka, on the other hand, went in by the usual entrance, doffing his shoes and sword; with his canopy folded up, he stood to leeward of the seers, rendering them homage with clasped hands. The seers, addressing Sakka, asked him if he did not feel disgust at their smell, inasmuch as they were humans and he a god. Sakka answered that the scent of virtuous men is lovely, like unto a wreath of varied blossoms (S.i.226).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Isidásí Therí&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;She was the daughter of a good and wealthy merchant of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/ujjenii')"&gt;Ujjení&lt;/a&gt;. Having come of age, she was given in marriage to the son of a merchant in Sáketa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For one month she lived with him as a devoted wife; then because of her past kamma, her husband became estranged from her, and turned her out of the house. She was married again with the same result, and a third time to a friar. Isidásí's father persuaded him to give up the pilgrim's life; he dwelt with his wife only for a fortnight and refused to stay with her any more. Isidásí then met the therí&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/j/j')"&gt;Jinadattá&lt;/a&gt;, whom she entertained to a meal at her house. Under Jinadattá, Isidásí joined the Order and became an arahant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Therígáthá (vv.400-47), which contains forty-seven verses ascribed to her, describes not only her present life, but also her past lives. She had been a worker in gold in Erakaccha and had committed adultery in that life. As a result she was born in hell for a long time, and, in subsequent births became an ape, a goat, an ox, a hermaphrodite slave and a carter's daughter. In this last birth she was sold to a merchant in payment of her father's debts. When she was sixteen, the merchant's son, Giridása, fell in love with her and married her. He had already one wife, and the new one caused dissension between her and her husband. Therefore it was that in this life she was hated by her husbands. This account of her sojourn in samsára was related by Isidásí in response to a request by one of her fellow-nuns, Bodhí (ThigA.260ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mrs. Rhys Davids thinks (Sisters, Introd. pp.xxii f) that Isidásí's verses in the Therígáthá suggest late literary craft </data>
<data>and bear the impress of late literary creation. The scene is Pátaliputta, and not any of the usual towns mentioned in the Canon, and the name of Isidásí's sponsor – Jindattá - is, she says, significant. Perhaps there are traces here of Jainistic influence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Dípavamsa (xviii.9) Isidásí (Isidásiká) is mentioned in a list of eminent therís who were leaders of the Order of bhikkhunis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Isidinna&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A thera. He was the son of a setthi in Sunáparanta. He witnessed the miracle of the Buddha's acceptance of the Candana-málá (probably the Candanamálaka), and, having heard the Buddha preach, he became a Sotápanna. While still living the life of a householder, a compassionate spirit urged him to give it up. He entered the Order and soon after became an arahant (ThagA.i.312-3). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Theragáthás (vv.187-8) contains two verses which he uttered in confessing aññá. They were the same as were spoken to him by his friendly spirit. In the time of Vipassí Buddha, he was a householder and did homage to the Buddha's Bodhi-tree with a fan made of sumana-flowers (ThagA.312f). He is probably identical with Sumanavájaniya of the Apadána (Ap.ii.415).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

At that time there was a war between the gods and the Asuras. The seers considered the gods righteous but feared harm from the Asuras. They went, therefore, to Sambara, lord of the Asuras, and asked him for a pledge of safety; he refused, saying that the seers were followers of Sakka. The seers thereupon cursed him to suffer everlasting terror. It is said that that same night Sambara woke up thrice, seized with fright (S.i.227-8).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buddhaghosa (SA.i.266) adds that as a result of this curse, Sambara's mind became deranged and he came to be called Vepacitti (crazy-nerve).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

There was, on one side of it, a black stone called the Kálasilá. This was a favourite haunt of the Buddha and the members of the Order. See e.g., Viii.ii.76, where Dabba Mallaputta is asked by monks to provide for them accommodation there; see also Vin.iii.41.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was also the scene of the suicide of Godhika and Vakkali (S.i.121; iii.121f) and of the murder of Moggallána by the brigands (J.v.125f; DhA.iii.65).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Cúla Dukkhakkhanda Sutta it is said that a large number of Niganthas lived at Kálasilá, never sitting down, undergoing paroxysms of acute pain and agony, following the teachings of Nigantha Nátaputta. The Buddha questioned them as to their practises and preached to them the above-mentioned Sutta, which he afterwards repeated to Mahánáma (M.i.91ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once when the Buddha was dwelling at Kálasilá, he sang the praises of Rájagaha, giving Ananda a chance, if he so desired, of asking him to live on for a kappa; but Ananda did not take his opportunity (D.iii.116).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The books refer to several other visits of the Buddha to Isigilapassa. During one of these visits he heard Vangísa's high eulogy of Moggallána (S.i.194; Thag.1249ff). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Isigili Sutta (M.iii.68-71) the Buddha is represented as saying that while the other mountains round Rájagaha - Vebhára, Pandava, Vepulla and Gijjhakúta - had changed their old names, Isigili retained its former name and designation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Five hundred Pacceka Buddhas once resided in Isigili for a long time; they could be seen entering the mountain, but once entered, there was no more sign of them. Men, observing this, said that </data>
<data>the mountain swallowed up the sages and so it came by its name of Isigili (Isí gilatí ti = Isigili).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buddhaghosa adds (MA.ii.889) that when the Pacceka Buddhas returned from their begging rounds, the rock would open like a folding door to admit them.

Dutthagámaní consulted him with regard to all details and appointed him kammádhittháyaka from the commencement of the work (MT.550f). He had great psychic powers, and at the festival of the dedication of the Thúpa he created a parasol of copper, as great as the universe, to ward off any harm that might befall those taking part in the celebrations (Mhv.xxxi.85). He was at the side of the king throughout the festival (Mhv.xxxi.105), and, by virtue of his power, all the inhabitants of Ceylon, who wished to worship the relics at the Maháthúpa, were enabled to go to Anurádhapura the moment the wish to do so entered their hearts, and to return the same day (Mhv.xxxi.115).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This Indagutta is probably to be identified with the thera Indagutta, the head of a great parivena in Rájagaha, who came to Ceylon with eighty thousand monks to be present at the foundation-ceremony of the Maháthúpa (Mhv.xxix.30).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2.

Thirty thousand kappas ago, while on his way home laden with gifts, he found the river impassable and took his evening meal at a monastery. There he was pleased with the demeanour of the monks and gave them a meal of gruel with five savouries (? pañcanna yágu). After death, he was born in Távatimsa, and was king of gods thirty three times and king of men thirty times. Ap.ii.375f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Yasoja (v.l. Yasojoti) Thera&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was born outside the gates of Sávatthi in a fishing village, where his father was the headman of five hundred families. When he came of age, he was fishing one day in the Aciravatí, and, casting his net, caught a large golden colour fish. Yasoja and his companions took the fish to Pasenadi who sent them to the Buddha. The Buddha told them that the fish had been a wicked monk in the time of Kassapa Buddha, and had since suffered in purgatory, where his mother and sisters still were. He then preached to them the Kapila Sutta, and Yasoja and his companions, greatly moved, renounced the world (ThagA.i.356f.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Udána mentions (Ud.iii.3) how, later, Yasoja and five hundred of his companions went to see the Buddha at Jetavana. There they stood talking to the monks who lived there and made a great uproar. The Buddha, sending Ananda to fetch them, asked them to remove themselves from his presence, as they were behaving like fishermen. Taking his admonition to heart, they returned to the banks of the Vaggumudá in the Vajji country, and there they determined to lead such lives as would commend them to the Buddha. During the rainy season, they all put forth effort and attained arahantship. Some time after, the Buddha visited Vesáli during a journey and asked Amanda to send for Yasoja and his friends as he desired to see them. Ananda sent a message. When the monks arrived, they found the Buddha lost in meditation, and they, too, seated themselves and entered into samádhi, remaining thus throughout the night. Amanda could not understand why the Buddha, having sent for Yasoja and his companions, should have sunk into samádhi without greeting them, and three times during the night he tried to remind the Buddha of their arrival; but the Buddha </data>
<data>ignored his warnings and in the morning explained to him that it was more joy for them all to live in the bliss of samádhi than to indulge in mere conversation. It is said in UdA.185 that the Buddha spent the night in samádhi in order to show Yasoja and his companions that he regarded them as equals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is said (ThagA.i.357) that when Yasoja and the others visited the Buddha at Vesáli, they were very thin and had grown uncomely through their austerities. The Buddha commended their self denial in a verse, and Yasoja, appreciating the Buddha's praise, uttered two other verses, exalting the love of solitude (Thag.243 5).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Vipassí Buddha Yasoja belonged to a family of park-keepers (árámagopaká), and one day seeing the Buddha travel through the air, he gave him a labuja fruit (ThagA.i.356). In the time of Kassapa Buddha, Yasoja was the leader of a band of five hundred robbers. They were pursued by the villagers and fled into the forest for safety. There they saw a monk sitting on a stone and asked him for protection. He advised them to take the five precepts, and when they had done so, he exhorted them never to violate these precepts even if keeping them meant the loss of their lives. Soon after, they were captured and killed. But remembering the monk's admonition at the moment of death, they harboured no hatred against anyone, and after death were reborn in the deva world (UdA.179f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Vinaya relates (Vin.i.239) how once, when Yasoja was ill, drugs were brought for his use, but as the Buddha had forbidden the use of a special place for storing such things (kappiyabhúmi) they were left out of doors and were partly eaten by vermin, the remainder being carried away by robbers. When the matter was reported to the Buddha, he allowed the use of a duly chosen kappiyabhúmi. The Apadána verses ascribed to Yasoja in the </data>

Later, while journeying in the company of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sabhiya')"&gt;Sabhiya&lt;/a&gt;, he came to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/saavatthi')"&gt;Sávatthi&lt;/a&gt;, where he was present at the discussion between Sabhiya and the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddha')"&gt;Buddha&lt;/a&gt;. It was his purpose to try and discover flaws in the Buddha's argument. The Buddha knew what was in his mind, and at the end of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sabhiya')"&gt;Sabhiya Sutta&lt;/a&gt; admonished him in five verses (Thag.360 4). Yasadatta was greatly moved and entered the Order, winning arahantship in due course.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/padumuttara')"&gt;Padumuttara&lt;/a&gt; Buddha, he had been a very learned brahmin, living as an ascetic in the forest.

Yámá. &lt;/b&gt;A class of Devas, mentioned in lists of devas between those of Távatimsa and those of Tusita (E.g., Vin.i.12, A.i.228; iii.287; M.ii.194; iii.100, etc.). Two hundred years of human life are but one day to the Yáma devá, and two thousand Years, composed of such days, form their life period (A.i.213; iv.253). Sirimá, sister of Jívaka, was born after death in the Yáma world and became the wife of Suyáma, king of&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yámabhavana. From there she visited the Buddha with five hundred others. SNA i.244f.; see also VvA.246 for an upásaka born in the Yáma-world. In the Hatthipála Játaka (J.iv.475) mention is made of four Yáma-devas who were reborn as men. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The meaning of Yámá is explained in the Commentaries (E.g., VibhA.519; PSA.441) as &quot;those that have attained divine bliss&quot; (dibbam sukham yátá payátá sampattá ti Yámá). Other explanations are “misery freed&quot; or &quot;governing gods”. Compendium, p.138, n.2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2.

They do not please him, but a forest dwelling monk pleases him because he knows that, some day, that monk will find emancipation. A.iv.340ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

When she realized that her good fortune was due to her faith in the Buddha, she visited him at Jetavana and told him her story.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Yamaka Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Thera Yamaka held the view that, in so far as a monk has destroyed the ásavas, he is broken up and perishes at the break up of the body and becomes not after death. Yamaka's colleagues tried to correct this erroneous view (the heresy lies in the implication that &quot;a being is broken up and perishes”; SA.ii.226.) but failed, and so reported him to Sáriputta. Sáriputta visited Yamaka and argued with him that if it were false to say of anybody that he existed in truth, in reality, even in this very life, how much more so to speak of someone existing or not existing after death. Yamaka thereupon confessed his error. Sáriputta further elucidated the matter by using the simile of a man who enters the service of a rich householder with the intent to murder him. Such a man would always be a murderer, even though his master knew him not to be so. Even so, the disciple who regards body, etc., as permanent and so on, harbours a murderous view, even though he knows it not as such (S.iii.109ff). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sutta is often referred to. (E.g., VibhA.32; Vsm.479; cp. Vsm.626 (Yamakato sammasana). Does Yamakato here mean &quot;according to the Yamaka Sutta&quot;?). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is sometimes called the Yamakováda Sutta (E.g., Netti, p. 30).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Yama&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The god of death. (See, e.g., DhA.iii.337; Yamassa santikam = Maranasantikam).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When beings die they are led before him to be judged according to their deeds. Birth, old age, illness, punishment for crime and death, are regarded as his messengers, sent among men as a warning to abstain from ill and do good. Yama questions beings brought before him as to whether they have seen these messengers and profited by them. If the answer is in the negative, the nirayapálas take them away to the different hells (M.iii.179ff).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/maha_samaya_s')"&gt;Mahásamaya Sutta&lt;/a&gt; (D.ii.259) mention is made of two Yamas (duve Yamá), which the Commentary explains (DA.ii.690) by &quot;dve Yamakadevatá&quot; (the twins, whom Rhys Davids calls the Castor and Pollux of Indian Mythology, in Dial.ii.290, n.1). Elsewhere (AA.i.374; MA.ii.953) Buddhaghosa speaks of four Yamas (im c' esa eko va hoti, catusu pana dváresu cattáro janá honti) at the four gates (of the Nirayas?). He says that Yama is a Vemánikapetarájá, who sometimes enjoys all the pleasures of heaven, in a celestial mansion, surrounded by kapparukkhas, and at other times experiences the fruits of his kamma. He is a good king.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Játakas* the Nirayas are particularly mentioned as Yama's abode (Yamakkhaya, Yamanivesana, Yamasádana, etc.); but, more generally, all Samsára is considered as subject to Yama's rule, and escape from samsára means escape from Yama's influence, Yama being the god of Death. It is evidently in this sense that Yama is called Vesáyi (q.v.) (J.ii.317, 318). Yama is sometimes mentioned** with &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/i_/inda')"&gt;Indra&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/va/varuna')"&gt;Varuna&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/soma')"&gt;Soma&lt;/a&gt;,</data>

There is a tradition (A.i.142) that once Yama longed to be born as a human being and to sit at the feet of a Tathágata.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yama's Nayanáyudha is mentioned (SNA.i.225) among the most destructive of weapons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;* E.g., J.ii.318; iv.273; v.268, 274, 304. The Vetaraní is mentioned as forming the boundary of Yama's kingdom (i.21; J.ii.317; iii.472; but see ii.318). At J.iv.405, Yama's abode is called Ussadaniraya. DhA.i.334 explains Yamaloka by Catubbidham apáyalokam. Cp. PvA.33 (Yamaloko ti petaloko); ibid., 107 (Yamavisayam = Petalokam).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** E.g., J.vi.201; D.i.244; at Mil.37 the list includes Kuvera, Suyáma and Santusita; cp.

It is divided into ten chapters (called Yamaka)   Múla, Khandha, Áyatana, Dhátu, Sacca, Sankhárá, Anusaya, Citta, Dhamma and Indriya. The method of treatment of each of the ten divisions tends to be threefold.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Yamaka pátiháriya&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The miracle of the &quot;double appearances”. When the Buddha laid down a rule forbidding the exercise of supernatural powers by monks -  following on the miracle performed by Pindola Bháradvája (q.v.) -  the heretics went about saying that henceforth they would perform no miracles except with the Buddha. Bimbisára reported this to the Buddha, who at once accepted the challenge, explaining that the rule was for his disciples and did not apply to himself. He, therefore, went to Sávatthi, the place where all Buddhas perform the Miracle. In reply to Pasenadi, the Buddha said he would perform the miracle at the foot of the Gandamba tree on the full moon day of Asálha. This was in the seventh year after the Enlightenment (DA.i.57). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The heretics therefore uprooted all mango trees for one league around, but, on the promised day, the Buddha went to the king's garden, accepted the mango offered by Ganda, and caused a marvelous tree to sprout from its seed. The people, discovering what the heretics had done, attacked them, and they had to flee helter skelter. It was during this flight that Púrana Kassapa (q.v.) committed suicide. The multitude, assembled to witness the miracle, extended to a distance of thirty six leagues. The Buddha created a jewelled walk in the air by the side of the Gandamba. When the Buddha's disciples knew what was in his mind, several of them offered to perform miracles and so refute the insinuations of the heretics. Among such disciples were Gharaní, Culla Anátthapindika, Círá, Cunda, Uppalavanná and Moggallána. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha refused their offers and related the Kanhausabha and Nandivisála Játakas. Then, standing on the jewelled walk, he proceeded to perform the Yamaka-pátiháriya (Twin Miracle), so called because it consisted in the appearance of phenomena of </data>
<data>opposite character in pairs -  e.g., producing flames from the upper part of the body and a stream of water from the lower, and then alternatively. Flames of fire and streams of water also proceeded alternatively from the right side of his body and from the left. DA.l.57; DhA.iii.214f. explains how this was done. From every pore of his body rays of six colors darted forth, upwards to the realm of Brahmá and downwards to the edge of the Cakkavála. The Miracle lasted for a long while, and as the Buddha walked up and down the jewelled terrace he preached to the multitude from time to time. It is said that he performed miracles and preached sermons during sixteen days, according to the various dispositions of those present in the assembly. At the conclusion of the Miracle, the Buddha, following the example of his predecessors, made his way, in three strides, to Távatimsa, there to preach the Abhidhamma Pitaka to his mother, now born as a devaputta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Twin Miracle is described at DA.i.57, and in very great detail at DhA.iii.204; see also J.iv.263ff. The DhA. version appears to be entirely different from the Játaka version; the latter is very brief and lacks many details, especially regarding Pindola's miracle and the preaching of the Abhidhamma in Távatimsa. The account given in Dvy. (143-66) is again different; the Miracle was evidently repeatedly performed by the Buddha (see, e.g., Candanamálá), and it is often referred to -  e.g., J.i.77, 88, 193; Ps.i.125; SNA.i.36; AA.i.71; MA.ii.962; Mil. 349; Vsm.390; PvA.137; Dáthávamsa i.50. The miracle was also performed by the Buddha's relics; see, .e.g., Mhv.xvii.52f.; Sp.i.88, 92.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is said (Mil.349) that two hundred millions of beings penetrated to an understanding of the Dhamma at the conclusion of the Miracle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Twin Miracle can only be performed by the Buddha. </data>

He was the eldest of one thousand sons, and Yuditthila was his younger brother. After he came of age he was on his way early one morning to the park, and saw all around him dew. In the evening, as he returned home, the dew drops were no more to be seen. His charioteer explained that the sun had dried them up. Reflecting on this, the prince realized the impermanence of life and asked his father's leave to renounce the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both his parents tried to dissuade him but they failed, and he and Yudhitthila built a hermitage in the Himálaya, where they became ascetics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yudhitthila is identified with Ananda. This story was told in reference to the Buddha's Renunciation, to some monks who marvelled at the Buddha's great sacrifice. J.iv.119ff.; the story of Yuvañjaya (Yudhañjaya) is also given in the Cariyápitaka iii.1; CypA.143ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Yasa &lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Yasa Thera. &lt;/b&gt;He was the son of a very wealthy treasurer of Benares, and was brought up in great luxury, living in three mansions, according to the seasons and surrounded with all kinds of pleasures. Impelled by antecedent conditions, he saw one night the indecorum of his sleeping attendants, and, greatly distressed, put on his gold slippers and left the house and the town, non humans opening the gates for him. He took the direction of Isipatana, exclaiming: &quot;Alas! What distress! Alas! What danger!&quot; The Buddha saw him in the distance and called to him, &quot;Come Yasa, here is neither distress nor danger.&quot; Filled with joy, Yasa took off his slippers and sat beside the Buddha. The Buddha preached to him a graduated discourse, and when he had finished teaching the Truths, Yasa attained realization of the Dhamma. To Yasa's father, too, who had come in search of his son, the Buddha preached the Doctrine, having first made Yasa invisible to him. (This is given as an example of the Buddha's iddhi power, Vsm.393).  At the end of the sermon he acknowledged himself the Buddha's follower, (he thus became the first tevácika upásaka) and Yasa, who had been listening, became an arahant. When, therefore, Yasa's presence became known to his father, who asked him to return to his grieving mother, the Buddha declared that household life had no attractions for Yasa and granted his request to be admitted to the Order. The next day, at the invitation of Yasa's father, he went, accompanied by Yasa, to his house, and there, at the conclusion of the meal, he preached to Yasa's mother and other members of the household, who all became his followers, thus becoming the first teváciká upásiká. When Yasa's intimate friends, Vimala, Subáhu, Punnaji and Gavampati, heard of Yasa's ordination they followed his </data>
<data>example and joined the Order, attaining arahantship in due course, as did fifty others of Yasa's former friends and acquaintances (Vin.i.15 20; DhA.i.72).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Sumedha Buddha, Yasa was a king of the Nágas and invited the Buddha and his monks to his abode, where he showed them great honour and hospitality. He then gave costly robes to the Buddha and to each monk a pair of valuable robes. In the time of Siddhattha Buddha he was a Treasurer, and offered the seven kinds of jewels at the Bodhi tree. In the time of Kassapa Buddha he was a monk. For eighteen thousand kappas he was a deva king and one thousand times he was king of men. Wherever he went he had a gold canopy, and in his last life over his funeral pyre was a gold canopy (ThagA.i.232f). He is evidently identical with Sabbadáyaka of the Apadána (Ap.i.333f). A verse attributed to him is found in the Theragáthá (vs.117).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yasa is often quoted as one who enjoyed great luxury in his lay life (AA.ii.596).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dhammapada Commentary (DhA.i.82f ) states that, in a past life, Yasa and his four companions wandered about engaged in various acts of social service. One day they came across the dead body of a pregnant woman, which they took to the cemetery to be cremated. There the others went away, leaving Yasa to finish the work. While burning the corpse his mind was filled with thoughts of the foulness of the human body; he drew the attention of his friends to this idea, and, later, of his parents and wives, all of whom approved of what he said. For this reason Yasa felt revulsion against the household life, and his friends and members of his family were able to realize the Dhamma early in the Buddha's career.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ordination of Yasa was one of the scenes of the Buddha's life to be sculptured in the Relic Chamber of the Mahá Thúpa </data>
<data>(Mhv.xxx.79).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Anguttara Commentary (AA.i.218f), Sujátá Senánídhítá (who gave the Buddha a meal of milk rice just before his Enlightenment) was Yasa's mother. She became a sotápanna after listening to the Buddha's sermon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Yasa. &lt;/b&gt;Called &lt;b&gt;Kákandakaputta&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was the son of the brahmin Kákandaka and was a pupil of Ananda. It is said he was fortunate enough to see the Buddha alive (Mhv.iv.57f).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When he arrived at the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kuutaagaarasaalaa')"&gt;Kútágárasálá&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahavana')"&gt;Mahávana&lt;/a&gt;, he discovered that the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/va/vajjiputtakaa')"&gt;Vajjian&lt;/a&gt; monks had raised the &quot;Ten Points&quot; (dasavatthu) contrary to the Buddha's teachings, and that they were publicly asking for money from their lay disciples. Yasa thereupon protested against such misdemeanours, and the Vajjian monks, hoping to win him over, offered him a share of the money they had collected.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This offer he rejected with scorn, and the monks passed on him the Patisárattiyakamma (craving of pardon from lay folk). This necessitated that Yasa should be sent among the laymen, accompanied by a messenger, presumably to ask their pardon for having misinformed them. But instead of this, Yasa told the lay people that the behaviour of the Vajjian monks was completely at variance with the rules laid down by the Buddha, and quoted the Buddha's discourses to prove his charge.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the Vajjian monks heard of this, they pronounced on him the Ukkhepaniya Kamma (Act of Suspension), but when they assembled to carry it out, Yasa disappeared through the air to Kosambí, from where he sent messengers to the monks of Avanti, of the west (Pátheyyaká or Páveyyaká) and of the south (Dakkhinápatha), asking </data>
<data>for their assistance in checking the corruption of the religion. With them he visited Sambhúta Sánavásí at Ahogangapabbata, and there they decided to consult &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/r/revata')"&gt;Revata&lt;/a&gt; who lived in Soreyya. Yasa, therefore, went to Revata, following him through Sankassa, Kannakujja, Udumbara, Aggalapura and Sahajáti. Having found Revata, he questioned him regarding the ten points, and obtained from him promise of assistance.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together they returned to Vesáli, where lived Sabbakámí, the oldest Thera of the day. After obtaining his opinion on the matter, an assembly of the monks was held and a committee was appointed (to settle the matter by an Ubbáhiká) of four from the East: Sabbakámí, Sálha, Khujjasobhita, and Vásabhagámika; and four from the West: Revata, Sambhúta-Sánavásí, Yasa and Sumana. They debated the question at the Válikáráma, Revata acting as questioner and Sabbakámí answering his questions. At the end of the enquiry the decision was given against the ten points of the Vajjian monks, and this decision was conveyed to the assembly. Then the recital of the Vinaya was held in which seven hundred monks participated; this recital was called the Sattasatí. Vin.ii.294ff.; Mhv.iv.9ff.;; Dpv.iv.45ff.; v.23. The Mhv. says that at first the king (Kálásoka) was inclined to support the Vajjians, but his sister, Nandá Therí, warned him against this (iv. 37ff.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The monks who refused to accept the findings of the committee held another convocation, which was called the Mahásangíti (Dpv.v.30ff.). The Sattasatí Recital (also called The Second Recital) was also named (E.g., AA.i.251; MA.ii.880) Yasathera sangíti, evidently because of the prominent part played by Yasa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yasa is ranked (See, e.g., DA.ii.525) among the great benefactors of the religion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3.

The country was converted by the Thera Mahárakkhita, who was sent there after the Third Council (Mhv.xii.5; Dpv.viii.9; Sp.i.67). In the time of Milinda the capital of the Yona country was Ságala (Mil.1). It is said (Mhv.xxix.39) that at the Foundation Ceremony of the Mahá Thúpa, thirty thousand monks, under Yona Mahádhammarakkhita, came from Alasandá in the Yona country. Alasandá was evidently the headquarters of the Buddhist monks at that time. Alasandá is generally identified (See, e.g., Geiger, Mhv. Trs. 194, n.3) with the Alexandria founded by the Macedonian king (Alexander) in the country of the Paropanisadae near Kábul.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Assaláyana Sutta (M.ii.149), Yona and Kamboja are mentioned as places in which there were only two classes of people, masters and slaves, and the master could become a slave or vice versa. The Commentary (MA.ii.784) explains this by saying that supposing a brahmin goes there and dies, his children might consort with slaves, in which case their children would be slaves. In later times, the name Yavaná or Yoná seems to have included all westerners living in India and especially those of Arabian origin (Cv.Trs.ii.87, n.1). Yonaka, statues, holding lamps, were among the decorations used by the Sákyans of Kapilavatthu (MA.ii.575). The language of the Yavanas is classed with the Milakkhabhásá (E.g., DA.i.276; VibhA.388). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Anguttara Commentary (AA.i.51) records that from the time of Kassapa Buddha the Yonakas went about clad in white robes, because of </data>

Yugandhara.&lt;/b&gt; One of the mountains of the Himálaya (J.i.119, 232; iv.213; vi.125; DhA.i.249; Vsm.206). It forms the first of the seven ranges round Sineru (SNA, ii.443; but according to J.vi.125 it is the fourth range).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Yugandharaságara (e.g., J.i.64; vi.43) is also sometimes mentioned, and was probably a sea between Yugandhara and the next mountain range. When the Buddha reached Távatimsa in three strides, his first stride was from the earth to Yugandhara (DhA.iii.216). It was on the summit of Yugandhara that Assagutta convened an assembly of the monks in order to discuss their plan of campaign against Milinda (Mil.p.6). The sun is mentioned as first rising over Yugandhara (E.g., SA.ii.165), hence the expression “Like the morning sun over Yugandhara.” E.g. PvA.137.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Yugandhara.&lt;/b&gt;-One of the chief Yakkhas to be invoked by the Buddha's followers in time of need. D.iii.205&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

He killed Siva at the festival sports at Tissavápi and ruled as king for seven years and eight months (112-20 A.C.). His gate watchman, Subha, bore a strong resemblance to him, and Tissa would sometimes deck Subha in all his royal ornaments and place him on the throne, where all the nobles of the court paid him homage, thinking him to be the king, Tissa, meanwhile, enjoying the fun, as watchman. One day, as Tissa stood at the door, laughing to himself, Subha charged him with impertinence and ordered the guard to slay him. Mhv.xxxv.49ff.; Dpv.xxi.46.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Yakkha&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A class of non human beings generally described as amanussá. They are mentioned with Devas, Rakkhasas, Dánavas, Gandhabbas, Kinnaras, and Mahoragas (? Nágas) (E.g., J.v.420).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other lists (E.g., PvA. 45, 55) they range immediately above the Petas; in fact, some of the happier Petas are called Yakkhas. Elsewhere (E.g., A.ii.38) they rank, in progressive order, between manussá and gandhabbá. They are of many different kinds: spirits, ogres, dryads, ghosts, spooks. In the early records, yakkha, like nágá, as an appellative, was anything but depreciative. Thus not only is Sakka, king of the gods, so referred to (M.i.252; J.iv.4; DA.i.264), but even the Buddha is spoken of as a yakkha in poetic diction (M.i.386). Many gods, such as Kakudha, are so addressed (S.i.54).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a passage in the Vimánavatthu Commentary, (VvA.333) which gives illustrations, the term is used for Sakka, the Four Regent Gods (Mahárájáno), the followers of Vessavana, and also for puriso (individual soul?). In the scholiast to the Jayadissa Játaka (J.v.33), the figure of the hare in the moon is also called yakkha. Of these above named, the followers of Vessavana appear to be the Yakkhas proper. The term yakkha as applied to purisa is evidently used in an exceptionally philosophical sense as meaning &quot;soul&quot; in such passages as ettávatá yakkhassa suddhi (SN.vs.478), or ettávat' aggam no vadanti h' eká, yakkhassa suddhim idha pánditáse (SN.vs.875).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Niddesa (MNid.282), yakkha is explained by satta, nara, mánava, posa, puggala, jíva, jagu, jantu, indagu, manuja. The last term is significant as showing that yakkha also means &quot;man.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cult of yakkhas seems to have arisen primarily from </data>
<data>the woods and secondarily from the legends of sea faring merchants. To the latter origin belong the stories connected with vimánas found in or near the sea or in lakes. The worship of trees and the spirits inhabitating them is one of the most primitive forms of religion. Some, at least, of the yakkhas are called rukkha devatá (E.g., J.iii.309, 345; Pv.i.9; PvA.5) (spirits of trees), and others bhummadevatá, (PvA.45,55) (spirits of the earth), who, too, seem to have resided in trees. Generally speaking, the Yakkhas were decadent divinities, beings half deified, having a deva's supernormal powers, particularly as regards influencing people, partly helpful, partly harmful. They are sometimes called devatá (E.g., S.i.205), or devaputta (E.g., PvA. 113, 139). Some of these, like Indakúta and Suciloma, are capable of intelligent questioning on metaphysics and ethics. All of them possess supernatural powers; they can transfer themselves at will, to any place, with their abodes, and work miracles, such as assuming any shape at will. An epithet frequently applied is mahiddhika (E.g., Pv.ii.9; J.vi.118). Their appearance is striking as a result of former good kamma (Pv.i.2, 9; ii.11; iv.3, etc.). They are also called kámakámí, enjoying all kinds of luxuries (Pv.i.3), but, because of former bad kamma, they are possessed of odd qualities, thus they are shy, they fear palmyra leaf and iron. Their eyes are red and they neither wink nor cast a shadow. J.iv.492; v.34; vi.336, 337; these various characteristics are, obviously, not found in all Yakkhas. The Yakkhas are evidently of different grades -  as is the case with all classes of beings – the highest among them approximate very nearly to the devas and have deva-powers, the lowest resemble petas. The Yakkhas are specially mentioned as being afraid of palm leaves (J.iv.492).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their abode is their self created palace, which is </data>
<data>anywhere, in the air, in trees, etc. These are mostly ákasattha (suspended in the air), but some of them, like the abode of Álavaka, are bhumattha (on the ground) and are described as being fortified (SNA.i.222). Sometimes whole cities   e.g., Álakamandá   stand under the protection of, or are inhabited by, Yakkhas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In many respects they resemble the Vedic Pisácas, though they are of different origin. They are evidently remnants of an ancient demonology and have had incorporated in them old animistic beliefs as representing creatures of the wilds and the forests, some of them based on ethnological features. (See Stede: Gespenstergeschichten des Petavatthu v.39ff ).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In later literature the Yakkhas have been degraded to the state of red eyed cannibal ogres. The female Yakkhas (Yakkhiní) are, in these cases, more fearful and evil minded than the male. They eat flesh and blood (J.iv.549; v.34); and devour even men (D.ii.346; J.ii.15ff.) and corpses (J.i.265). They eat babies (J.v.21; vi.336) and are full of spite and vengeance (DhA.i.47; ii.35f.). The story of Bhúta Thera is interesting because his elder brothers and sisters were devoured by a hostile Yakkha, so the last child is called Bhúta to propitiate the Yakkha by making him the child's sponsor!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ordinarily the attitude of the Yakkhas towards man is one of benevolence. They are interested in the spiritual welfare of the human beings with whom they come in contact and somewhat resemble tutelary genii. In the Atánátiya Sutta (D.iii.194f), however, the Yakkha king, Vessavana, is represented as telling the Buddha that, for the most part, the Yakkhas believe neither in the Buddha nor in his teachings, which enjoin upon his followers abstention from various evils and are therefore distasteful to some of the Yakkhas. Such Yakkhas are disposed to molest the followers of the Buddha in </data>
<data>their woodland haunts. Cp. the story of the Yakkha who wished to kill Sáriputta (Ud.iv.4). But the Mahá Yakkhas (a list in D.iii.204f), the generals and commanders among Yakkhas, are always willing to help holy men and to prevent wicked Yakkhas from hurting them. Among Yakkhas are some beings who are sotápannas -  e.g., Janavasabha, Suciloma and Khara (s.v.). Some Yakkhas even act as messengers from another world, and will save prospective sinners from committing evil (Pv.iv.1). The case of the Yakkha Vajirapáni is of special interest. D.i.95. The Commentary (DA.i.264) says he is not an ordinary Yakkha, but Sakka himself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is represented as a kind of mentor, hovering in the air, threatening to kill Ambattha, if he does not answer the Buddha's question the third time he is asked. In many cases the Yakkhas are &quot;fallen angels&quot; and come eagerly to listen to the word of the Buddha in order to be able to rise to a higher sphere of existence   e.g., Piyankaramátá and Punabbasumátá, and even Vessavana, listening to Velukandakí Nandamátá reciting the Paráyana Vagga (A.iv.63). At the preaching of the Mahásamaya Sutta (q.v.) many hundreds of thousands of Yakkhas were present among the audience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has been pointed out (Stede, op. cit) that the names of the Yakkhas often give us a clue to their origin and function. These are taken from (a) their bodily appearance   e.g., Kuvanná, Khara, Kharaloma, Kharadáthika, Citta, Cittarája, Silesaloma, Súciloma and Háritá; (b) their place of residence, attributes of their realms, animals, plants, etc.   e.g., Ajakalápaka, Álavaka (forest dweller), Uppala, Kakudha (name of plant), Kumbhíra, Gumbiya, Disámukha, Yamamoli, Vajira, Vajirapáni or Vajirabáhu, Sátágira, Serísaka; (c) qualities of character, etc.   e.g., Adhamma, Katattha, Dhamma, Punnaka, Mára, Sakata; (d) embodiments of former persons   </data>
<data>e.g., Janavasabha (lord of men= Bimbisára), Dígha, Naradeva, Pandaka, Sívaka, Serí.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vessavana (q.v.) is often mentioned as king of the Yakkhas. He is one of the four Regent Gods, and the Átánátiya Sutta (D.iii.199ff) contains a vivid description of the Yakkha kingdom of Uttarakuru, with its numerous cities, crowds of inhabitants, parks, lakes and assembly halls. Vessavana is also called Kuvera, and the Yakkhas are his servants and messengers. They wait upon him in turn. The Yakkhinís draw water for him, and often are so hard worked that many die in his service. E.g., J.iv.492. Mention is also made (e.g., DA.ii.370) of Yakkhadásís who have to dance and sing to the devas during the night. Early in the morning they drink a cup of toddy (surá) and go off into a deep sleep, from which they rise betimes in the evening ready for their duties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No one, apparently, is free from this necessity of waiting upon the king   even Janavasabba has to run errands for Vessavana (D.ii.207). Among the duties of Vessavana is the settling of disputes between the devas, and this keeps him (J.vi.270) much occupied. In this work he is helped by the Yakkhasenápati, whose business it is to preside over the courts during eight days of each mouth (SNA.i.197). The Yakkhas hold regular assemblies on Manosilátala on the Bhagalavatípabbata (SNA.i.187; cp. D.iii.201 and DA.iii.967). As followers of Kuvera, lord of riches, the Yakkhas are the guardians and the liberal spenders of underground riches, hidden treasures, etc., with which they delight men. E.g., Pv.ii.11; PvA.145; Pv.iv.12; PvA.274. These were seven yakkhas who guarded the wealth of Jotiyasetthi (DhA.iv.208f.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is difficult to decide whether the Yakkhas, who are the aborigines of Ceylon (Lanká), were considered human or non human. Kuvení, one of their princesses, and her maid, can both assume different forms, but Vijaya </data>
<data>marries Kuveni and has two children by her. (Cp. Vin.iii.37; iv. 20; where sexual intercourse with a Yakkha is forbidden). The Yakkhas are invisible, and Vijaya is able to kill them only with the help of Kuveni (Mhv.vii.36); but their clothes are found fit for Vijaya and his followers to wear (Mhv.vii.38). Again, Cetiyá (q.v.) could make herself invisible and assume the form of a mare, but Pandukábhaya lived with her for four years and she gave him counsel in battle. Later, when he held festivities, he had the Yakkha Cittarája on the throne beside him (Mhv.x.87). In all probability these Yakkhas were originally considered as humans, but later came to be confused with non humans. Their chief cities were Lankápura and Sirísavatthu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The commonly accepted etymology of Yakkha is from the root yaj, meaning to sacrifice. Thus: yajanti tattha balim upaharantí ti yakkha (VvA.224), or pújaníyabhávato yakkho, ti uccati (VvA.333).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Thus are putthujjanas threshed by objects, etc.; thoughts of a future birth thresh them even more thoroughly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once Vepacitti and the Asuras were defeated by Sakka and the Devas and Vepacitti was bound hand and foot. But when Vepacitti thought that the Devas were righteous, his bonds slackened. Subtle were the bonds of Vepacitti, but more subtle are those of Mára. He who possesses conceits of tanhá ditthi mána is Mára's bondsman. S.iv.201ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

The full moon day of Vesákha was chosen for very solemn undertakings, such as the crowning of Devánampiyatissa (Mhv.xi.42), the laying of the Foundation Stone of the Mahá Thúpa (Mhv.xxix.1), etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

He was the eldest of the thirty two sons of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/siihabaahu')"&gt;Síhabáhu&lt;/a&gt;, king of Lála, and of Síhasívalí. Because of his evil conduct he, with seven hundred others, was deported by the king, with their heads half shaved. Their wives and children were deported with them. The children landed at Naggadípa and the women at Mahiládípaka (MT. 264). Vijaya and the other men landed at Suppáraka, but was obliged to leave owing to the violence of his supporters.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Dpv.ix.26, Vijaya went from Suppáraka to Bhárukaccha, where he stayed for three months. They reached Ceylon on the day of the Buddha's death, received the protection of the deva Uppalavanda, and thus escaped destruction by the Yakkhas. The Yakkhiní, Kuvení, fell in love with Vijaya, and he, with her assistance, killed the Yakkhas of Lankápura and Sirísavatthu, and founded the city of Tambapanni. Vijaya's chief ministers, Anurádha, Upatissa, Ujjena, Uruvela and Vijita, founded separate colonies, named after themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vijaya had two children by Kuvení, Jívahattha and Dípellá; but when he wished to be consecrated king, he sent for and obtained, for his wife, a daughter of the Pandu king of Madhurá. Kuvení, thereupon, left him and was killed by the Yakkhas. Vijaya reigned for thirty eight years and was succeeded by Panduvásudeva.

(E.g., J.iii.121; iv.342; she was called Kosaladeví   e.g., J.ii.403). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;* Vedehiputto ti, vedehíti panditá dhivacanam etam;   pandititthiyá putto ti attho (SA.i.120); cf.

Beings are born there as a result of developing the Fourth Jhána (AbhS. chap. v., see. 3 d). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their life span is five hundred mahakalpas, (Ibid., sec. 6; A.ii.128, 129) and even puthujjanas can be born there (VbhA.376). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Baka Brahma was once an inhabitant of Vehapphala (J.iii.358; SA .i.162). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anágámís born there reach Nibbána without going elsewhere (VbhA.522). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buddhaghosa explains (Ibid., 521= MA.i.29) the name thus: vipulá phalá ti = Vehapphalá. In ages in which the world is destroyed by wind, Vehapphala forms the limit of the destruction (CypA.9).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Velukantakí, Velukandakí, Velukantakiyá&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lady of Velukanta (Velukanda). She is mentioned as an exemplary lay woman (A.i.88; ii.164). She founded, for the Order headed by Sáriputta and Moggallána an offering which the Buddha praised, because it was endowed with the six requisite qualities. See Dána Sutta (1).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once she rose before dawn and sang the Paráyana. Vessavana happened to be passing over her house on his way from north to south (to see the Buddha, says SNA.i.369), and hearing the song, stopped at her window to praise it and to reveal his identity. She greeted him cordially, and in return for her greeting he announced to her that Sáriputta and Moggallána were on their way to Velukanta. She, delighted with the news, made all preparations and sent word to the monastery, inviting the monks to the house. After the meal, she informed the Elders that Vessavana had told her of their arrival. When they expressed their amazement, she told them of several other virtues possessed by her. Her only son Nanda was seized by the king's men and killed before her eyes, but she experienced no disquiet, nor did she when her husband, after his death, having been born as a Yakkha (Bhummadevatá says the Commentary), revealed himself to her. She was guilty of no transgression of the precepts, could enter into the four jhánas at will, and had cast off the five lower fetters. The monks expressed their great admiration and Sáriputta preached to her (A.iv.63ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buddhaghosa says (AA.ii.718; cf. SNA.i.370) that she was an anágámí, and that, when she promised to share with Vessavana the merits she would gain by entertaining the monks, headed by the two Chief Disciples, Vessavana, to show his gratitude, filled her stores with rice, and these stores remained always full throughout her life. They thus became proverbial.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
<data>&lt;p&gt;The Sutta Nipáta Commentary (SNA.i.370) states that she kept a daily fast and knew the Pitakas by heart. It also says that, at the end of her recital of the Paráyana, Vessavana offered her a boon, and she asked that, as her servants were weary of carrying the harvest home from the fields, Vessavana should allow his Yakkhas to do the work for them. To this he agreed, and his followers filled for her one thousand two hundred and fifty store houses. Vessavana then went to the Buddha and told him of what had happened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dhammapada Commentary (DhA.i.340) mentions Velukantakí Nandamátá and Khujjattará as the chief lay women disciples of the Buddha. But in the Anguttara list' of eminent lay women, while Velukantakí Nandamátá's name does not occur, Khujjatará is mentioned. Mention is made of a Nandamátá, eminent in meditation, but she is called Uttará.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A.i.26; cf. S.ii.236, where the same two are mentioned; Mrs. Rhys Davids thinks that Velukantakí Nandamátá is probably identical with Uttará Nandamátá (Brethren 4, n.1). This identification does not seem to be correct. See Uttará Nandamátá; see also Nanda-Kumáputta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Vijayabáhu&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Vijayabáhu. &lt;/b&gt;King of Ceylon (Vijayabáhu I., 1059-1114 A.C.). His earlier name was Kitti; his parents were Moggallána and Lokitá (Cv.lvii.42f.; but see Cv.Trs.i.201, n.1), and from his thirtieth year he lived in Múlasálá. Later, without the knowledge of his parents, he left home, defeated the general Loka, and became Adipáda of Malaya after bringing this province under his power. At the age of sixteen he defeated Kassapa, chief of the Kesadhátus, and became ruler of Rohana as well, assuming the title of Yuvarája and the name of Vijayabáhu. At this time the Colas were in possession of the government at Pulatthipura, and they made efforts to stem the advance of Vijayabáhu. They were at first successful, owing to the disunion among the Singhalese themselves, but Vijayabáhu conquered the Cola armies near Palutthapabbata and marched to Pulatthipura. He was helped by forces sent by the king of Rámañña, to whom he sent an embassy with various presents. He had, however, to bide his time, and retreated to Vátagiri. From there he went, in due course, to Mahánágahula, his officers having, in the meantime, crushed all opposition in Dakkhinadesa and captured the province of Anurádhapura and the district round Mahátittha. When he felt the right moment had arrived, Vijayabáhu marched once more to Pulatthipura and captured it after a siege of one and a half months. From there he advanced to Anurádhapura, spent three months in the city and returned to Pulatthipura. This was fifteen years after he became Yuvarája. In the eighteenth year he crowned himself king, under the title of Sirisanghabodhi, making his younger brother Vírabáhu Yuvarája and governor of Dakkhinadesa, and his other brother, Jayabáhu, Adipáda and governor of Rohana. The king had several queens, among whom was Lílávatí, a Cola princess and </data>
<data>daughter of Jagatípála; by her he had a daughter Yasodhará. Another of his queens was a Kálinga princess, Tilokasundarí, by whom he had five daughters   Subhaddá, Sumittá, Lokanáthá, Ratanávalí and Rúpavatí   and a son called Vikkamabáhu. Vijayabáhu gave his younger sister, Mittá, in marriage to the king of Pandu, refusing an offer of marriage made by the Cola king.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When peace had been established, Vijayabáhu sent messengers to Anuruddha, king of Rámañña, and fetched monks from that country to help in the reformation of the Sangha in Ceylon. He gave over the whole district of Alisára for the use of the monks and built many viháras. He translated the Dhammasangani and held an annual Dandissara offering. He also had the Tipitaka copied, and presented the copies to various monks. Because the Singhalese envoys sent to Kannáta were insulted and maimed, the king prepared to send a punitive expedition to Cola, but the Velakkára troops revolted, captured Mittá and her children, and burned the king's palace. The king was forced to retreat to Dakkhinadesa but, with the help of Vírabáhu, he defeated the rebels. In the forty fifth year of his reign he took an army to Cola and stopped at a seaport in that country; but as the Cola king refused to accept his challenge to fight, he returned to his own country. He repaired many tanks and restored many viháras in various parts of the country. He provided facilities for pilgrims journeying to Samantakúta, and patronized the Lábhavásí and the Vantajívaka monks. He ruled for fifty five years. Vírabáhu died before him, and he made Jayabáhu Uparája in his place. For details of Vijayabáhu's reign, see Cv. chaps. lviii lx.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Vijayabáhu.&lt;/b&gt; Sister's son of Parakkamabáhu I. and king of Ceylon (Vijayabáhu II., 1186-87 A.C.). He succeeded his uncle. Among his acts was the grant of an amnesty to all those </data>
<data>imprisoned by Parakkamabáhu I., and the dispatch of an embassy to the king of Arimaddana with a letter in Páli, composed by himself. He was a good king, but was slain at the end of one year's reign by Mahinda (afterwards Mahinda VI.). His viceroy was Kittinissanka. Cv.lxxx.1-18.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Vijayabáhu.&lt;/b&gt; King of Ceylon (Vijayabáhu III., 1232-36 A.C.). He claimed descent from King Sirisanghabodhi I. and was lord of the Vanní. He found the government of Ceylon in the hands of the Damilas, and, after defeating them, he established the seat of government in Jambuddoni. He sent for the monks, who, with Vácissara at their head, had left Ceylon during the preceding disturbed period and had deposited the Buddha's Alms bowl and Tooth Relic in the rock fortress at Billasela. The king did much for the reform of the priesthood and built various monasteries, chief of which was the Vijayasundaráráma and the Vijayabáhu vihára. He had two sons, Parakkamabáhu and Bhuvanekabáhu. He appointed the Elder Sangharakkhita as head of the Order in Ceylon. Cv.lxxxi.10ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Vijayabáhu.&lt;/b&gt; King of Ceylon (Vijayabáhu IV., 1271-72 A.C.). He was the eldest of the five sons of Parakkamabáhu II., his brothers being Bhuvanekabáhu, Tibhuvanamalla, Parakkamabáhu and Jayabáhu. With the consent of the monks, Parakkamabáhu II. handed over the government, before his death, to Vijayabáhu, who was evidently very popular, and was known among his subjects as a Bodhisatta. (See, e.g., Cv.lxxxviii.35). He restored Pulatthipura and built and renovated numerous monasteries, among them the vihára at Titthagáma. During his reign, Candabhánu invaded Ceylon, but was defeated by the king with the help of his Adipáda, Vírabáhu. Vijayabáhu built a city near Subhagiri and made it his seat of government. He restored the Ratnávalí cetiya and gave Anurádhapura into the </data>
<data>charge of the Vanni chiefs. Later, when Vírabáhu had completely restored Pulatthipura, the king was consecrated there in the presence of his father, who came over from Jambuddoni. Then, at the desire of his father, he held, on the Maháválukagangá, at Sahassatittha, a festival for admission into the Order. The celebrations lasted a fortnight, and the king conferred on the monks various ranks, such as mahásámipáda, múlatherapáda, parivenathera, etc. Two years after the death of Parakkamabáhu, Vijayabáhu was slain by a treacherous general, named Mitta. For details regarding Vijayabáhu, see Cv.lxxxvii.14 xc.1. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vijayabáhu's son was Parakkamabáhu III . Cv.xc.48.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;5. Vijayabáhu.&lt;/b&gt; King of Ceylon (Vijayabáhu V.). He succeeded Vannibhuvanekabáhu, and was himself succeeded by Bhuvanekabáhu IV. Cv.xc.105; he was among the successors of Parakkamabáhu IV., and reigned somewhere between 1302 and 1346 A.C.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;6. Vijayabáhu.&lt;/b&gt; King of Ceylon (Vijayabáhu VI.). He was one of the successors of Parakkamabáhu VI. His immediate predecessor was Víraparakkamabáhu.

This the snake refused to do even though threatened with death by the doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to a vow taken by Sáriputta. Some villagers once brought some meal cakes to the monastery, and when the monks present there had eaten, it was suggested that what remained should be saved for those monks who were absent in the village. This was done, but a young colleague of Sáriputta, arriving very late, found that Sáriputta had already eaten his portion, whereat he was very disappointed. Sáriputta immediately vowed never again to touch meal cakes, and the Buddha said that Sáriputta would never return to anything which he had once renounced. The snake is identified with Sáriputta.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Vipassí&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The nineteenth of the twenty four Buddhas. He was born in the Khema park in Bandhumatí, his father being Bandhumá and his mother Bandhumatí. He belonged to the Kondañña gotta. For eight thousand years he lived as a householder in three palaces: Nanda, Sunanda and Sirimá. His body was eighty cubits in height. His wife was Sutaná (v.l. Sudassaná) and his son Samavattakkhandha. He left the household in a chariot and practised austerities for eight months. Just before his enlightenment, the daughter of Sudassana setthi gave him milk rice, while a yavapálaka named Sujáta gave grass for his seat. His bodhi was a pátali tree. He preached his first sermon in Khemamigadáya to his step brother Khandha and his purohita's son Tissa; these two later became his chief disciples. His constant attendant was Asoka; Candá and Candamittá were his chief women disciples. His chief lay patrons were Punabbasummitta and Nága among men, and Sirimá and Uttará among women. He died in Sumittáráma at the age of eighty thousand, and his relics were enshrined in a thúpa seven leagues in height. The Bodhisatta was a Nága king named Atula. (Bu.xx.1ff.; BuA.195f.; D.ii.2ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three reasons are given for the name of this Buddha (BuA.195; cf. DA.ii.454; SA.ii.15): (1) Because he could see as well by night as by day; (2) because he had broad eyes; (3) because he could see clearly after investigation. Vipassí held the uposatha only once in seven years (DhA.iii.236), but on such occasions the whole Sangha was present (Sp.i.186). The construction of a Gandhakuti for Vipassí brought Mendaka great glory in the present age. Mendaka's name at the time was Avaroja (DhA.iii.364f). Aññákondañña was then known as Cúlakála, and nine times he gave Vipassí Buddha the first fruits of his fields. DhA.i.81f.&lt;/p&gt;</data>

Sakka's throne was heated by his great generosity, and, feeling nervous for his safety, Sakka contrived that all Visayha's possessions should disappear. Quite undaunted, Visayha became a grass cutter, and for six days gave alms from the money so earned, he and his wife fasting. On the seventh day, while cutting grass, he fainted, and Sakka, appearing before him, suggested that he, should be moderate in his generosity. Visayha rejected the suggestion as unworthy and declared that his aim was Buddhahood. Thereupon Sakka praised him and made him prosperous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related to Anáthapindika, as mentioned in the Khadirangára Játaka. Visayha's wife is identified with Ráhulamátá. J.iii.128 32; see also J.i.45.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story is given in the Játakamálá (No. 5), where the setthi is called Avisayha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Vepacitti&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;An Asura chieftain, who was present with Namuci (Mára) at the preaching of the Mahásamaya Sutta (D.ii.259). It is said that among the Asuras, Vepacitti, Ráhu and Pahárada were the chiefs. E.g., AA.ii.758, Vepacitti being the highest (sabbajetthaka, SA.i.263).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vepacitti was the friend of Ráhu, and when Ráhu seized Candimá and Suriya and these invoked the power of the Buddha, it was to Vepacitti that Ráhu fled for comfort (S.i.50, 51). The Asuras being once defeated in a fight with the Devas, the latter took Vepacitti prisoner, and brought him, bound hand and foot, to Sakka in the Sudhammá hall. There Vepacitti reviled and railed at Sakka with scurrilous words, both on entering and on leaving the hall, but Sakka remained silent, and, when questioned by Mátalí, said it was not proper for him to bandy words with a fool. S.i.221f.; cf. S.iv.201, according to which his bondage caused him no inconvenience so long as he remained with the devas, but the moment he experienced the wish to rejoin the Asuras, he felt himself bound. Vepacitti's capture is referred to in Thag.vs.749.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On another occasion Vepacitti suggested that victory should be given to him or to Sakka, according to their excellence in speech. Sakka agreed to this, and Vepacitti, as the older god, was asked to speak a verse. Sakka spoke another, the Devas applauding. Several verses were spoken by each, and both Devas and Asuras decided in favour of Sakka, because Vepacitti's verses belonged, they said, to the sphere of violence, while those of Sakka belonged to one of concord and harmony (S.i.222f). Once, when Sakka was revolving in his mind the thought that he should not betray even his enemy, Vepacitti read his thoughts and came up to him. &quot;Stop,&quot; said Sakka, &quot;thou art my </data>
<data>prisoner&quot;; but Vepacitti reminded him of his thought, and was allowed to go free (S.i.225).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buddhaghosa says (SA.i.266) that Vepacitti's original name was Sambara (q.v.). When Sambara refused to give to the seers, who visited him, a pledge that the Asuras would not harm them, the seers cursed him, and from that time onwards he slept badly and was plagued by nightmares. This so deranged his mind (cittam vepati) that he came to be called Vepacitti (&quot;Crazy nerve&quot;). When Vepacitti lay ill of this disease, Sakka visited him and offered to cure him if he would teach him Sambara's magic art. Vepacitti consulted the Asuras, and, as they were unwilling, he refused Sakka's offer, warning him that Sambara, having practised magic, was suffering in purgatory and that he should avoid a similar fate (S.i.238f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buddhaghosa explains that, if Vepacitti had taught him the art, it was Sakka's intention to take Vepacitti to the seers and persuade them to forgive him (SA.i.272). This episode seems to contradict Buddhaghosa’s previous statement that Sambara and Vepacitti were identical. Perhaps, as Mrs. Rhys Davids suggests (KS.i.305, n.4), Sambara was the name of an office rather than that of a person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mention is made (S.i.226) of a visit once paid by Sakka and Vepacitti to a company of seers dwelling in a forest hut. Vepacitti, in his buskins, his sword hanging at his side and his state canopy borne over his head, entered by the main gate, while Sakka, in all humility, used the side gate. Buddhaghosa explains (SA.i.265) the strange relations of Sakka and Vepacitti by saying that they were father  and son in law, and that they were sometimes at war with each other; sometimes, however, they lived in concord. The Dhammapada Commentary (DhA.i.278 L; cf. J.i.205f ) gives the story of the romantic marriage of Sakka to Vepacitti's daughter, Sujá (q.v.).&lt;/p&gt;</data>
<data>&lt;p&gt;According to the Kathá vatthu, other members of Vepacitti's family appear to have intermarried with the devas, and the Kathá vatthu Commentary says that a troop of Asuras, belonging to the retinue of Vepacitti, was once freed from the fourfold plane of misery and was taken up among the devas. See Points of Controversy, p. 211.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Sanskrit texts call him Vemacitra or Vemacitrí. E.g., Dvy., pp. 126, 148; Mtu.iii.138,254.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Later, he was born as King Mahápatápa.

He built the Ganthamba vihára and held there a ceremony of ordination. He was succeeded by his cousin Senaratna, whom he persuaded to leave the Order that he might assume the duties of kingship (Cv.xciv.6ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* He seems to have made a special casket for the Relics, which Kittisirirájasíha later overlaid with gold; Cv.c.21; Cv.

He held festivals in honour of the Tooth Relic and the Footprint at Sumanakúta and, sending an embassy to Rakkhanga, obtained thirty three monks, headed by Santána Thera, to reorganize the Order in Ceylon.

The lion reluctantly agreed to this, but the jackal, in his attempts to leap on to the elephant, missed his aim and fell to the ground where he was crushed to death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related in reference to Devadatta's attempt to pose as the Buddha and his failure to do so, wherefore he received a kick on the chest from Kokálika (q.v.).

When the child was born, two friends of Vasabha, Vela and Sumana, came with gifts, and the boy was given their two names. When Velusumana grew up, he went to live with Sumana, governor of Girijanapada, and broke in a horse with which everyone else had failed. Sumana therefore gave him one hundred thousand and sent him to Kákavannatissa’s court (Mhv.xxiii.68ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Viháradeví wished to drink water in which had been washed the sword which cut off the head of Nandasárathi, Elára’s chief warrior, Velusumana was entrusted with the task of killing Nandasárathi. He therefore went to Anurádhapura, where he became friendly with the keeper of the king's state horse, Váha. One day he took the horse to bathe in the Kadambanadí, and, after announcing his name, rode away on him. Elará sent Nandasárathi in pursuit. Velusumana stood concealed behind a thicket, on a mound called Nigrodhasála, with drawn sword, and as Nandasárathi rode past quickly, he was transfixed by Velusumana's sword (Mhv.xxii.51ff.; MT. 440f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Velusumana took a prominent part in the capture of Vijitapura (Mhv.xxv.25). &lt;span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman"&gt;See also Ras.ii.6f. and 97f. where the details differ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

He was made Adipáda by Vijayabáhu I., and, when his son Gajabáhu was born, the king gave the province of Rohana for his welfare. Vikkamabáhu lived there with Mahánágahula (Cv.lx.88f) as his capital. When Vijayabáhu died, some of Vikkamabáhu’s relations, Jayabáhu and the three sons of Mittá (Mánábharana, Kittisirimegha and Sirivallabha) conspired to keep him out of the succession, but he defeated them in various battles and took possession of the capital Pulatthipura, losing, however, Dakkhinadesa and his former province of Rohana (Cv.lxi.2f). A year later his enemies again rose in revolt, led by Mánábharana, and, as Vikkamabáhu advanced to Kalyaní to fight them, Víradeva, of Palandípa (q.v.) landed in Mannára, and his attention was diverted. In the first engagements, Vikkamabáhu was defeated by Víradeva and forced to flee to Kotthasára, but Víradeva was later defeated and slain at Antaravitthika. From then onwards Vikkamabáhu and the three sons of Mittá (see above) lived each in his province, but became unpopular both with the sangha and the laity owing to their greed and lust. Following the death of Jayabáhu and the Queen Mittá, Vikkamabáhu appears to have been acknowledged king (Vikkamabáhu II.); and it was evidently as such that the birth of his nephew, the prince who after became Parakkamabáhu. I., was reported to him. Vikkamabáhu had two sons, Mahinda, and Gajabáhu, but asked that his nephew should be sent to the court; this request, however, was not granted (Cv.lxii.58f).

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Visuddhi-Magga&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;An encyclopedia of the Buddha's teaching, written by Buddhaghosa at the request of Sanghapála Thera. It is said (Cv.xxxvii.236) that when Buddhaghosa arrived at the Mahávihára and asked permission to translate the Singhalese Commentaries into Páli, the monks, to test him, gave him two stanzas (quoted at the beginning of the book) on which they asked him to write a thesis. As soon as he had finished this, the devas hid the copy, and the same thing happened after it was rewritten. He then rewrote it a third time, and when it was being read in the assembly of monks, the two previous copies suddenly reappeared and were found to agree in every detail with the new one. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a description of the book, see Law, Hist. of Páli Lit., ii.399f. A Commentary on the work exists, called the Paramatthamañjúsa by Dhammápála (P.L.C. 113; Svd.1231), and a Visuddhimaggaganthipadattha was written by Sáradassí, a monk of Ava. (Sás.116; Bode, op. cit., 56).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

(D.ii.4; S.ii.191; Bu.xxiii.20. J.i.42). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He received his name because he was a peerless preacher of the Dhamma. (M.i.333; quoted at PSA. p. 496).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Vidhúra&lt;/b&gt;.

Vutthi Sutta.&lt;/b&gt; A conversation between two devas and the Buddha's comments thereon. Of things making for progress, knowledge is the best; ignorance is the greatest worsener; among beings that walk, the Sangha is the best; among declarants, the Buddha is the best. S.i.42.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Vutthi Sutta.&lt;/b&gt; At the end of the rains, Sáriputta takes leave of the Buddha to go into the country. As he is about to start, a monk reports to the Buddha that Sáriputta has offended him and has not asked his pardon. (The Commentary (AA.ii.797) explains that the skirt of Sáriputta's robe brushed the Elder; some say the wind blew it without his knowledge.) Sáriputta is sent for and asked to explain; he declares with a wealth of simile that he is free from hatred and ill will; he has nothing but loathing for his body; how then would he offend a brother monk and not ask his pardon? The accuser is convinced of his folly and begs forgiveness. (A.iv.373ff.; cf. DhA.ii.178ff., where the story recurs.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Vimána Vatthu&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sixth book of the Khuddaka Nikáya. It describes the splendour of various celestial abodes belonging to different devas, obtained by them as reward for some meritorious act performed in a previous life. The stories were learnt from the devas themselves, by Moggallána, Vangísa and others, during their sojourn in the deva-worlds, and reported by them to the Buddha. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Commentary on the work exists by Dhammapála, forming part of the Paramatthadípaní, and sometimes called Vimalatthavilásiní (q.v.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stories from the Vimána Vatthu were related by Mahinda in Ceylon in his first sermon to Anulá and her five hundred companions.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Veroca&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;An Asura chieftain. All the hundred sons of Bali were named after him (D.ii.259). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buddhaghosa says (DA.ii.689) that Veroca was another name for Ráhu, and that he was the uncle of Bali's sons. He is probably identical with Verocana, lord of the Asuras' who, according to the Samyutta Nikáya (S.i.225f), went with Sakka to visit the Buddha during his siesta. They waited upon the Buddha, leaning against a doorpost, and each uttered two stanzas on the necessity of striving until one's aim is accomplished.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

According to the Mátanga Játaka (J.iv.388; cf. Dvy. 451, 456), Mátanga lived in a hermitage on the upper reaches of the river in order to humble the pride of Játimanta, who lived lower down. On the banks of the river was a city, also called Vettavatí. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Milinda-pañhá (p.114) the Vettavatí is mentioned as one of the ten chief rivers flowing from the Himálaya. It is probably identical with the Vetravatí mentioned in Kálidása's Meghadúta, and is identified with the modern Betuva in Bhopal (the ancient Vidísa).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Vettavatí.&lt;/b&gt; A channel branching off from the Parakkamasamudda; the sluice from which it started bore the same name. Cv.lxxix.44.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

(Dpv.vi.15; xii.14, 35; Sp.i.70, 71; Mhv.xiii.6 9,18).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vedisa was fifty yojanas from &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/paataliputta_gama')"&gt;Pátaliputta&lt;/a&gt; and was founded by the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sakya')"&gt;Sákiyans&lt;/a&gt; who fled from &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/viduudabha')"&gt;Vidúdabha's&lt;/a&gt; massacre (Mbv., p. 98).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vedisa is identified with the modern Bhilsa in Gwalior State, twenty six miles north east of Bhopal.

There exist several Commentaries on the work, chief of which are the Vuttodaya pañciká (or Chandosáratthavikásiní) by Saddhammañána and Tíkás by Vepullabuddhi of Pagan, and Navavimalabuddhi or Culla vimalabuddhi of Panyá.

Buddhaghosa explains (SNA.ii.482) that this is the name of a mahatá kháraodiká nadí (the great &quot;Caustic River&quot;) referred to in the Devadatta Sutta (M.iii.185). Its waters are sharp and bitter (tinhadhárá, khuradhárá) (SN. vs. 674; cf. J.v.269), and the river flows by the Asipattavana. When beings enter it to bathe and drink (because it looks like a sheet of water) they are hacked by swords and other sharp weapons which stand concealed along the river bank. (SNA.ii.482; J.v.275; vi. 105; where a long description is given of the horrors of Vetaraní.) Sometimes Vetaraní is used in a general way to indicate Niraya. (As &quot;desanásísa” – e.g. J.iii.473; SA.i.48; cf. J.iv.273). Those guilty of abortion are reborn in the Vetaranínadí (J.v.269), as are also oppressors of the weak (J.vi.106).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2.

The Bodhisatta, who was Sakka, saw this, and, assuming the form of a parrot, visited them and sang the praises of the ascetic life.

The brahmins of that village visit the Buddha, and their leader Vacchagotta expresses his admiration of the Buddha's translucent colour in various similes, suggesting that it may be due to the luxurious beds on which the Buddha is able to sleep. The Buddha, however, answers that the costly beds mentioned by Vacchagotta are not for recluses like himself, but that he has three different &quot;couches,&quot; each of which gives him great comfort of body and mind: the broad celestial (dibba) couch, the sublime couch, and the Ariyan couch. He explains the nature of these couches and of the four jhánas. The Venágapura brahmins thereupon accept the Buddha as their teacher. A.i.180ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

The goose had two sons, and they, noticing that their father often went to Mithilá to see Vinílaka, offered to go and fetch him. They perched Vinílaka on a stick and dew with the ends of the stick in their beaks. As they flew over Mithilá, Vinílaka saw King Videha (the Bodhisatta) riding in his state chariot and boasted that Videha was no better off than he himself, since he was being carried by a pair of golden geese. The geese, in their anger, wished to drop him, but took him on to their father and told him of his son's words. The goose was very angry on hearing this and sent Vinilaka home to his mother.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related in reference to an attempt by Devadatta, at Gayásísa, to imitate the Buddha when he was visited by Sáriputta and Moggallána.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vinílaka is identified with Devadatta.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Vibbhanta bhikkbu Vatthu&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story of a monk, living with Mahá Kassapa, who returned to lay life and associated with bad companions. One day Kassapa saw him being led to execution for some crime and asked him to recall the meditation which, in former days, had enabled him to gain the Fourth Jhána. The man did so and was without fear. The executioners, finding him unconcerned with their punishments of him, took him to the king who, after enquiry, released him. Later he visited the Buddha and became an arahant. DhA.iv.52f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

S.iv.109.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Vesáli Sutta.&lt;/b&gt; The Buddha once addressed the monks on the great benefits of meditating on asubha, and then retired into solitude in the Mahávana for a fortnight. The monks, filled with the idea of asubha, felt loathing for their bodies and many committed suicide. The Buddha hearing of this, summoned the monks to the Kútágárasálá and taught them the great merits of concentration on breathing. S.v.320f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

He was born in the pleasance of Anoma (Commentary, Anúpama), his father being the khattiya Suppatita (Supatita) and his mother Yasavatí. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the day of his birth he roared &quot;like a bull&quot; a shout of triumph, hence his name (vasabhanádahetuttá). (But MT. 63 gives another explanation: hínam janánam abhibhúto maggena abhibhavitakilesahíno ti vá. Dvy.333 calls him Visvabhú). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For six thousand years he lived in the household in three palaces: Ruci, Suruci and Vaddhana (Rativaddhana); his wife was Sucittá, and their son Suppabuddha. He left home in a golden palanquin, practiced austerities for six months, was given milk rice by Sirivaddhaná of Sucittanigama, and grass for his seat by the Nága king Narinda, and attained Enlightenment under a sála tree. He preached his first sermon at Anuráráma to his brothers, Sona and Uttara, who became his chief disciples. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among women his chief disciples were Dámá and Samálá, his constant attendant Upasanta (Upasannaka), his chief lay patrons Sotthika and Ráma among men, and Gotamí (Káligotamí) and Sirimá among women. He was sixty cubits in height and lived for sixty thousand years. He died at the Khemáráma in Usabhavatí and his relics were scattered. The Bodhisatta was King Sudassana of Sarabhavatí. (Bu.xxii.1ff.; BuA.205ff.; D.ii.5.; J.i.41).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vessabhú Buddha kept the uposatha once in every six years. DhA.iii.236.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Vidhurapandita Játaka (No. 545)&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;v.l. Vidhúrapandita.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Four kings   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Dhanañjaya Korabba, king of Indapatta; &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Sakka, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;the Nága king Varuna, and &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Venateyya king of the Supannas   &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;having taken the uposatha-vows, meet together in a garden and there have a dispute as to which of them is the most virtuous. They cannot decide among themselves and agree, therefore, to refer the matter to Dhanañjaya's minister, Vidhurapandita (the Bodhisatta). The minister listens to the claims of each and then declares that all are equal; their virtues are like the spokes of a wheel. They are pleased, and Sakka gives the minister a silk robe, Varuna a jewel, the Supanna king a golden garland, and Dhanañjaya one thousand cows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vimalá, Varuna's wife, hearing from her husband of Vidhura's wisdom, is so enchanted that she yearns to see him, and in order to do so feigns illness, and says that she must have Vidhura's heart. Varuna's daughter, Irandatí, is offered to anyone who can get possession of Vidhura's heart, and the Yakkha Punnaka, nephew of Vessavana, who sees her and is fascinated by her beauty, accepts the condition. He obtains Vessavana's consent by a ruse and visits Dhanañjaya's court. There he challenges the king to a game of dice, giving his name as Kaccáyana, and offers as stake his wonderful steed and all seeing gem, provided the king will offer Vidhura as his. Dhanañaya agrees, plays and loses. Vidhura agrees to go with Punnaka; the king asks him questions regarding the householder's life for his own guidance, and Vidhura is given three days' leave to visit his family. Having taken leave of them, he goes with Punnaka. On the way Punnaka tries in vain to kill him by frightening him. </data>
<data>When Vidhura discovers Punnaka's intention, he preaches to him as he sits on the top of the Kálapabbata, and the Yakkha is so moved that he offers to take Vidhura back to Indapatta. But in spite of his protestations, Vidhura insists on going on to the Nága world. They arrive in Varuna's abode; Vidhura preaches first to Varuna and then to Vimalá. They are both delighted, and Punnaka wins the hand of Irandatí. In his great joy Punnaka gives Vidhura his marvellous jewel and takes him back to Indapatta. There Vidhura relates his adventures and gives the jewel to the king. A festival lasting one month is held in honour of Vidhura's return.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related in reference to the Buddha's wisdom. Vidhura's chief wife, Anujjá, is identified with Ráhulamátá; his eldest son, Dhammapála, with Ráhula; Varuna with Sáriputta; the Supanna king with Moggallána; Sakka with Anuruddha, and Dhanañjaya with Ananda (J.vi.255-329).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Játaka is also referred to as the Punnaka Játaka (E.g., J.iv.14, 182). Four scenes from the Játaka are found on the Bharhut Tope. Cunningham, Bharhut, p.82.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

A pilgrim, a clever disputant, came to try and defeat him in debate. But, in answer to his question, the hermit asked him another, and the pilgrim was forced to retire discomfited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related in reference to a Paribbájaka who came to Sávatthi to debate with the Buddha, but who was forced to own defeat. The two disputants were identical. J.ii.257f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Vimala was his earlier name, but later he came to be called Vimalakondañña. When the Buddha visited Vesáli, Vimala was impressed by his majesty and entered the Order, attaining arahantship soon afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Vipassí Buddha he was a rich householder, and one day, being present while the Buddha preached to a large number of people, he rejoiced so much that he offered him four golden flowers. The Buddha, by his magic power, caused the golden hue of the flowers to pervade the whole region. Vimala died soon after and was reborn in Tusita. Forty three kappas ago he became king sixteen times under the name of Nemí. ThagA.i.145f.; a verse containing a riddle and ascribed to Vimala is given in Thag. vs. 64. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A sermon preached by Vimala helped Ambapálí to develop insight and win arahantship.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Vessavana&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the names of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kuvera')"&gt;Kuvera&lt;/a&gt;, given to him because his kingdom is called Visáná (D.iii.201; SNA.i.369, etc.). He is one of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/caatummahaaraajikaa')"&gt;Cátummahárájáno&lt;/a&gt; and rules over the Yakkhas, his kingdom being in the north (E.g., D.ii.207). In the Átánátiya Sutta he is the spokesman, and he recited the Átánátiya-rune for the protection of the Buddha and his followers from the Yakkhas who had no faith in the Buddha. D.iii.194; he was spokesman because &quot;he was intimate with the Buddha, expert in conversation, well trained&quot; (DA.iii.962).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He rides in the Náríváhana, which is twelve yojanas long, its seat being of coral. His retinue is composed of ten thousand crores of Yakkhas. (SNA.i.379; the preacher’s seat in the Lohapásáda at Anurádhapura was made in the design of the Náríváhana, Mhv.xxvii.29). He is a sotápanna and his life span is ninety thousand years (AA.ii.718). The books record a conversation between him and Velukantakí Nandamáta (q.v.), when he heard her sing the Paráyana Vagga and stayed to listen. When Cúlasubhaddá wished to invite the Buddha and his monks to her house in Sáketa, and felt doubtful about it, Vessavana appeared before her and said that the Buddha would come at her invitation (AA.ii.483).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On another occasion (A.iv.162; on his way to see the Buddha) he heard Uttara Thera preaching to the monks in Dhavajáliká on the Sankheyya Mountain, near Mahisavatthu, and went and told Sakka, who visited Uttara and had a discussion with him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once when Vessavana was travelling through the air, he saw Sambhúta Thera wrapt in samádhi. Vessavana descended from his chariot, worshipped the Thera, and left behind two Yakkhas with orders to wait until the </data>
<data>Elder should emerge from his trance. The Yakkhas then greeted the Thera in the name of Vessavana and told him they had been left to protect him. The Elder sent thanks to Vessavana, but informed him, through the Yakkhas, that the Buddha had taught his disciples to protect themselves through mindfulness, and so further protection was not needed. Vessavana visited Sambhúta on his return, and finding that the Elder had become an arahant, went to Sávatthi and carried the news to the Buddha. ThagA.i.46f. Just as he encouraged the good, so he showed his resentment against the wicked; see, e.g., Revatí.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mention is made of Vessavana's Gadávudha* and his mango tree, the Atulamba**. Alavaka's abode was near that of Vessavana (SNA.i.240).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;* SNA.i.225; the books (e,g., SA.i.249; Sp.ii.440) are   careful to mention that he used his Gadávudha only while he was yet a   puthujjana.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;** J.iv.324, also called Abbhantaramba (see the   Abbharantara Játaka).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bimbisára, after death, was born seven times as one of the ministers (paricaraka) of Vessavana, and, while on his way with a message from Vessavana to Virúlhaka, visited the Buddha and gave him an account of a meeting of the devas which Vessavana had attended and during which Sanankumára had spoken in praise of the Buddha and his teachings (D.ii.206f). Vessavana seems to have been worshipped by those desiring children. See, e.g., the story of Rájadatta (ThagA.i.403). There was in Anurádhapura a banyan tree dedicated as a shrine to Vessavana in the time of Pandukábhaya (Mhv.x.89). Vessavana is mentioned as having been alive in the time of Vipassí Buddha. When Vipassí died, there was a great earthquake which terrified the people, but Vessavana appeared and quieted their fears (ThagA.i.149). Vessavana accompanied Sakka when he </data>
<data>showed Moggallána round Vejayanta pásáda. M.i.253; because he was Sakka's very intimate friend (MA.i.476).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As lord of the Yakkhas, it was in the power of Vessavana to grant to any of them special privileges, such as the right of devouring anyone entering a particular pond, etc. See, e.g., DhA.iii.74; J.i.128; iii.325 (Makhádeva). Sometimes, e.g., in the case of Avaruddhaka (DhA.ii.237), a Yakkha had to serve Vessavana for twelve years in order to obtain a particular boon (cf. J.ii.16,17). (Three years at J.iii.502.) Vessavana some times employs the services of uncivilized human beings (paccantamilakkhavásika) DA.iii.865f. The Yakkhas fear him greatly. If he is angry and looks but once, one thousand Yakkhas are broken up and scattered &quot;like parched peas hopping about on a hot plate&quot; (J.ii.399). This was probably before he became a sotápanna.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vessavana, like Sakka, was not the name of a particular being, but of the holder of an office. When one Vessavana died, Sakka chose another as his successor. The new king, on his accession, sent word to all the Yakkhas, asking them to choose their special abodes (J.i.328). It was the duty of Yakkhinís to fetch water from Anotatta for Vessavana's use. Each Yakkhiní served her turn, sometimes for four, sometimes for five months. But sometimes they died from exhaustion before the end of their term. (DhA.i.40; also J.iv.492; v.21).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vessavana's wife was Bhuñjatí (q.v.), who, like himself, was a devoted follower of the Buddha (D.ii.270). They had five daughters: Latá, Sajjá, Pavará, Acchimatí, and Sutá. For a story about them, see VvA.131f. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Punnaka was Vessavana's nephew. J.vi.265, 326.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pleasures and luxuries enjoyed by Vessavana have become proverbial. See, e.g., Vv.iv. 3, 46 (bhuñjámi kámakámí rájá Vessavano </data>
<data>yathá); MT. 676 (Vessavanassa rájaparihárasadisam); cf. J.vi.313.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An ascetic named Kañcanapatti (J.ii.399) is mentioned as having been the favourite of Vessavana. See also Yakkha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

She was the daughter of Tissa, king of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kalyaanii')"&gt;Kalyání&lt;/a&gt; and was cast adrift in a boat on the ocean in order to appease the sea gods in their wrath against Tissa for having killed an arahant. Her name was Deví, but because she came ashore near the monastery of Tolaka (?) (This is probably the correct reading of the name; see MT. 432) she was called Viháradeví (Mhv.xxii.20ff). When with her first child, she longed to eat a honeycomb one usabha in length and to drink the water in which had been washed the sword used in cutting off the head of Nandasárathí, chief of Elára's warriors (Mhv.42ff.; MT. 441). When she was the second time with child, she wished to lie under a campaka tree in bloom and inhale its fragrance (MT.443).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When her husband died, Saddhátissa carried her off, hoping thus to win the kingdom, but she was later restored to Dutthagámaní. She was wise and practical and helped in Dutthagámaní's campaigns, especially in the capture of Ambatittha and Anurádhapura (Mhv.xxv.9, 55). We know nothing of her later history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Veláma&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bodhisatta born as the chaplain of Benares. He was son of the preceding chaplain, and went with the crown prince to Takkasilá to study. There, in due course, he became a famous teacher, with eighty four thousand princes among his pupils. Later, he became chaplain to the Benares king. Every year the eighty four thousand princes came to Benares to pay their respects to the king, causing great suffering to the people. These complained to the king, and he asked Veláma to find a way out of the difficulty. Veláma marked out eighty four thousand provinces for the princes, and, thereafter, they obtained their supplies from their respective dominions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Veláma was exceedingly wealthy and wished to give alms. Therefore, turning his water jar upside down, he wished that if there were holy men in the world, the water should flow downwards. The water, however, remained in the jar. He then discovered by the same means that his gifts would be free from blame. He thereupon held great almsgivings, distributing during seven years the seven precious things and gifts of great value, pouring forth his riches as though &quot;making into one stream the five great rivers.&quot; A list of his gifts is found at A.iv.393f. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Veláma's story is given in AA.ii.802ff.; it is referred to in the Veláma  Sutta and in the introductory story to the Khadirangára Játaka (q.v.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Veláma's almsgiving became famous in literature as the Velámamaháyañña.

Once, an arahant monk, teaching a kammatthána to two monks, spoke of samuddha instead of samudda. One of the monks pointed out his error, and was sent by the arahant to the Mahávihára with a message that he had paid more attention to letters than to their meaning.

He then visited his friend, and, learning that he had been troubled by elephants, taught him a charm to ward off any harm which might come from them. This charm Udena later learnt from Allakappa.

He was a previous birth of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/maha_kassapa_th')"&gt;Mahá Kassapa&lt;/a&gt;. His wife was Bhaddá Kápilání in this age. Ap.ii.578.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Videha, Videhá.&lt;/b&gt; A country and its people. At the time of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddha')"&gt;Buddha&lt;/a&gt;, Videha formed one of the two important principalities of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/va/vajjii')"&gt;Vajjian&lt;/a&gt; confederacy. Its capital was &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/me_mu/mithilaa')"&gt;Mithilá&lt;/a&gt;. The kingdom bordered on the Ganges, on one side of which was &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/magadha')"&gt;Magadha&lt;/a&gt; and on the other Videha (See, e.g., M.i.225; MA.i.448). Adjacent to it were &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kaasi')"&gt;Kási&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kosala')"&gt;Kosala&lt;/a&gt;. In the&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/g/gandhaara_jat_406')"&gt;Gandhára Játaka&lt;/a&gt; (J.iii.365; iv. 316) the kingdom of Videha is said to have been three hundred leagues in extent, with sixteen thousand villages, well filled storehouses and sixteen thousand dancing girls. Videha was a great trade centre, and mention is made (PvA.227) of merchants coming from &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/saavatthi')"&gt;Sávatthi&lt;/a&gt; to sell their wares in Videha.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/suruci_jat_489')"&gt;Suruci Játaka&lt;/a&gt; seems to show that a close connection existed between Videha and Benares. In the Buddha's time, one of Bimbisára's queens was probably from Videha (see &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/vedehiputta')"&gt;Vedehiputta&lt;/a&gt;). Mention is also made (MA.i.534) of a friendship existing between the kings of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/g/gandhaara')"&gt;Gandhára&lt;/a&gt; and Videha. In earlier times Videha was evidently a kingdom, its best known kings being &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahajanaka')"&gt;Mahájanaka&lt;/a&gt; and </data>
<data>&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/n/nimi')"&gt;Nimi&lt;/a&gt;; but in the Buddha's time it was a republic, part of the Vajjian federation. According to the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahagovinda_s')"&gt;Mahágovinda Sutta&lt;/a&gt; (D.ii.235), it was King&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/r/renu')"&gt;Renu&lt;/a&gt; who, with the help of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/j/jotipaala')"&gt;Mahágovinda Jotipála&lt;/a&gt;, founded the Videha kingdom. The Commentaries (E.g., DA.ii.482; MA.i.184) state that Videha was colonized by the inhabitants, who were brought from &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pu/pubbavideha')"&gt;Pubbavideha&lt;/a&gt; by King Mandhátá.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Satapatha Bráhmana (I.iv.1), however, ascribes the kingdom to Máthava the Videgha, and gives as its boundaries Kausikí in the east, the Ganges to the south, the Sadárúra in the west, and the Himálaya in the north. In the centre of Videha was Pabbatarattha, in which was the city Dhammakonda, the residence of Dhaniya. (SNA.i.26).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The strainer used by the Buddha was honoured, after his death, by the people of Videha (Bu.xxviii.11).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Uruvela Kassapa was, in a previous birth, king of Videha (Ap.ii.483).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Videha. &lt;/b&gt;The name of a king of Videha, the father of the Bodhisatta in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/viniilak_jat_160')"&gt;Vinílaka Játaka&lt;/a&gt; (q.v.). v.l. Vedeha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Videha. &lt;/b&gt;A king of Videha who later became an ascetic. For his story see the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/g/gandhaara_jat_406')"&gt;Gandhára Játaka&lt;/a&gt;. He is identified with Ananda. v.l. Vedeha.

Having one day seen Moggallána begging in Vesáli for alms, she went to his dwelling and tried to entice him. Some say, adds the Commentator, that she was influenced by the heretics.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Vedabbha Játaka (No. 48)&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was once a brahmin who knew the Vedabbha charm which, if repeated at a certain conjunction of the planets, made the seven precious things rain down from the sky. The Bodhisatta was his pupil, and one day, while journeying in the forest, they were attacked by five hundred robbers called &quot;despatchers&quot; (pesankacorá). They were so called because when they took two prisoners they would keep one, sending the other for ransom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These robbers kept the brahmin and sent the Bodhisatta for the ransom. The Bodhisatta, knowing that that night the conjunction of the stars would occur, which ensured the efficacy of the charm, warned the brahmin not to make use of it. But when night came the brahmin repeated the charm, and the robbers were so delighted that he was able to persuade them to set him free. They set off with the treasures that had fallen from the sky, the brahmin accompanying them, but on the way they were attacked by another robber band. These were told that the brahmin could make treasures fall from the sky; they were therefore set free, only the brahmin being kept back. But on being told that they must wait for one year for the necessary conjunction of planets, they were angry, cut the brahmin in two, and pursued the first band of robbers, destroying them entirely. Unable to agree on the division of the spoils which they thus obtained, the second band fought among themselves till only two were left. These took the treasure and hid it in a jungle near the village. One guarded it while the other went to the village for rice. When he returned he cooked the rice, ate his share, and put poison in the rest hoping thus to rid himself of his companion; the latter, however, killed him, then ate the rice and died himself. The Bodhisatta returning with the ransom, found all the dead </data>
<data>bodies, in various places, and realized what had happened. He took the treasure to his own house.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to a self willed monk who is identified with the Vedabbha brahmin. J.i.253 6.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

He learnt, on enquiry, that these animals were attracted by his music, and ordered that they should be fed regularly. On finding that some of them failed to appear, he made arrangements for a drum to be sounded at the feeding time. Later, finding that a crocodile came and ate some of the fish, the king ordered him to be harpooned. The crocodile escaped capture, but died soon after.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related to a backsliding monk.

When the Buddha first visited Rájagaha, after his Enlightenment, he stayed at the Latthivanuyyána (Vin.i.35). The day after his arrival, he accepted the king's invitation to a meal at the palace, at the end of which the king, seeking a place for the Buddha to live   &quot;not too far from the town, not too near, suitable for coming and going, easily accessible to all people, by day not too crowded, by night not exposed to noise and clamour, clean of the smell of people, hidden from men and well fitted to seclusion&quot;   decided on Veluvana, and bestowed it on the Buddha and the fraternity. This was the first áráma accepted by the Buddha, and a rule was passed allowing monks to accept such an áráma. Vin.i.39f.; according to BuA. (19; cf. ApA.i.75) the earth trembled when the water - poured over the Buddha's hand by Bimbisára in dedication of Veluvana -  fell on the earth. This was the only áráma in Jambudípa, the dedication of which was accompanied by a tremor of the earth. It was the dedication of Veluvana which was quoted as precedent by Mahinda, when he decided to accept the Mahámeghavana, at Anurádhapura, from Devánampiyatissa (Mhv.xv.17).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha at once went to stay there, and it was during this stay that Sáriputta and Moggallána joined the Order. Vin.i.42.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kalandakanivápa (q.v.) is the place nearly always mentioned as the spot where the Buddha stayed in Veluvana. There many Vinaya rules were passed -  e.g., on the keeping of the vassa (Vin.i.137), the use of food cooked in the monastery (Vin.i.210f), the picking of edible (kappiya) fruit in the absence of any layman from whom permission to do so could be obtained (Vin.i.212), surgical operations on monks </data>
<data>(Vin.i.215f), the eating of sugar (Vin.i.226), the rubbing of various parts of the body against wood (Vin.ii.105), the use of the kinds of dwelling (Vin.ii.146) and the use of gold and silver (Vin.ii.196).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the Buddha's stay at Veluvana, Dabba Mallaputta, at his own request, was appointed regulator of lodgings and apportioner of rations, (Vin.ii.74. The Buddha was at Veluvana when Dabba also decided to die. He went there to take leave of the Buddha, Ud.viii.9) and Sáriputta and Moggallána brought back the five hundred monks whom Devadatta had enticed away to Gayásísa (Vin.ii.200). The Buddha spent the second, third, and fourth vassas at Veluvana. BuA.3; it was while the Buddha was at Veluvana that Devadatta attempted to kill him by causing Nálágiri to be let loose against him (J.v.335). It was a very peaceful place, and monks, who had taken part in the first Convocation, rested there, in Kalandakanivápa, after their exertions. It was there that they met Purána, who refused to acknowledge the authenticity of their Recital (Vin.ii.289f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Numerous Játakas were recited at Veluvana -  e.g., Asampadána, Upahána, Ubhatobhattha, Kandagalaka, Kálabáhu, Kukkuta, Kumbhila, Kurunga, Kurungamiga, Giridanta, Guttila, Culladhammapála, Cúlahamsa, Cúlanandiya, Jambu, Tayodhamma, Thusa, Dummedha, Dúbhiyamakkata, Dhammaddhaja, Nigrodha, Parantapa, Pucimanda, Mangala, Manicora, Manoja, Mahákapi, Maháhamsa, Músika, Romaka, Rohantamiga, Ruru, Lakkhana, Latukika, Vánara, Vánarinda, Vinílaka, Virocana, Saccankura, Sañjíva, Sabbadátha, Sarabhanga, Sáliya, Sigála, Sílavanága, Suvannakakkata, Hamsa and Háritamátá. Most of these refer to Devadatta, some to Ajátasattu, and some to Ananda's attempt to sacrifice his life for the Buddha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The books mention, in addition, various suttas which were preached there. Among those who visited the Buddha at Veluvana were several </data>
<data>devaputtas: Díghalattha, Nandana, Candana, Sudatta, Subrahmá, Asama, Sahali, Ninka, Akotaka, Vetambari and Mánavagámiya; also the Dhanañjaní brahmin; the Bháradvájas: Akkosaka, Asurinda, Bilangika, Aggika, Acela Kassapa, Susíma; the thirty monks from Pává (S.ii.187); Theras, like Mahákappina Aññákondañña (just before his death); Sonagahapatiputta, Samiddhi, Moliya Sívaka, Tálaputa, Manicúlaka, Mahácunda (during his illness), (S.v.181) Visákha (after his visit to Dhammadínná, who preached to him the Culla Vedalla Sutta), Abhayarájakumára, Gulissáni, Vacchagotta, Bhúmija, Samiddhi, Aciravata, Sabhiya, Vassaka, Suppabuddha, Pilindavaccha, Jánussoni and the princess Cundí; also Bimbisára's wife, Khemá, who went to Veluvana because she had heard so much of its beauty. Sáriputta and Ananda visited the Buddha there on several occasions, sometimes alone, sometimes in the company of others, and Ananda lived there for some time after the Buddha's death, and during his stay there preached the Gopakamoggallána Sutta. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sáriputta is mentioned as having held discussions there with, among others, Candikáputta and Láludáyí. A sermon preached by Mahá Kassapa to the monks at Veluvana is given at A.v.161ff.; for other suttas preached by the Buddha, see also S.i.231; ii.32, 183, 242, 254; iv.20; v.446; Ud.iv.9.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is said that Mára visited Veluvana several times (E.g., S.i.106f ) in order to work his will on the Buddha. The Buddha was there when three of the monks committed suicide -  Vakkali, Godhika and Channa -  and he had to pronounce them free from blame. News was brought to the Buddha, at Veluvana, of the illness of three of his disciples -  Assaji, Moggallána and Díghávu -  and he set out to visit them and comfort them with talks on the doctrine. Near Veluvana was a Paribbájaka Ráma, where the Buddha sometimes went with some of his disciples in </data>
<data>the course of his alms rounds. Two of his discussions there are recorded in the Cúla- and Mahá Sakuladáyí Suttas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the Buddha's lifetime, two thúpas were erected at the gate of Veluvana, one containing the relics of Aññá Kondañña (SA.i.219), and the other those of Moggallána (J.v.127).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Veluvana was so called because it was surrounded by bamboos (velu). It was surrounded by a wall, eighteen cubits high, holding a gateway and towers (SNA.ii.419; Sp.iii.576).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the Buddha's death, Dásaka, Upáli's pupil, lived at Veluvana, and there ordained Sonaka with fifty five companions. From there Sonaka went to the Kukkutáráma. (Mhv.v.115 f, 122; Dpv.iv.39).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dedication of Veluvana was among the scenes depicted in the Relic Chamber of the Mahá Thúpa (Mhv.xxx.80).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On one side of the main building of the Veluvana vihára was a building called Ambalatthika (MA.ii.635). There was also a senásana, built for the use of monks practising austerities (MA.ii.932).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is said that, after death, Vassakára was born as a monkey in Veluvana and answered to his name. He had been told during his lifetime that this destiny awaited him, and therefore took the precaution of seeing that the place was well supplied with fruit trees (MA.ii.854).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Hiouen Thsang (Beal, op. cit., ii.159), the Kalandaka nivápa (Karandavenuvana, as he calls it) lay one li to the north of Rájagaha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Veluvana. &lt;/b&gt;A bamboo grove in Kajangalá, where the Buddha once stayed. The upásakas of Kajangalá, having questioned the Kajangalá-Bhikkhuní, went to the Buddha there and asked him to verify her answers. A.v.54f&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Veluvana. &lt;/b&gt;A bamboo grove in Kimbilá, where the Buddha stayed and was visited by Kimbila. A.iii.247, 339: iv.84.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
<data>&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Veluvana.&lt;/b&gt; A monastery in Ceylon, built by Aggabodhi II. It was given by him to the Ságalikas (Cv.xlii.43). It probably lay between Anurádhapura and Manihíra, and Sanghatissa once lay in hiding there disguised as a monk (Cv.xliv.29; Cv.Trs.i.77, n.2). Jetthatissa III. gave to the vihára the village of Kakkalavitthi. Cv.xliv.99.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;5. Veluvana.&lt;/b&gt; A monastery erected by Parakkamabáhu I. in the suburb of Vijita in Pulatthipura. It consisted of three image houses, each three storeys high, a thúpa, a cloister, a two storeyed pásáda, four gateways, four long pásádas, eight small ones, one refectory, one sermon hall, seven fire hoses and twelve privies. Cv.lxxiii.152, lxxviii.87f.; see also Cv.Trs.ii.113, n.1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Vetullaváda&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A heretical doctrine which was introduced into Ceylon by Vohárika Tissa, but was suppressed by his minister Kapila (Mhv.xxxvi.41; Dpv.xxii.40). It appeared again later, and though officially disapproved, it does seem to have pushed its way among the monks of Ceylon, chiefly the Dhammarucikas (q.v.). E.g., in the reigns of Gothabhaya (Mhv.xxxvi.111), Mahásena, (xxxvii.1ff.), and Aggabodhi I. (Cv.xlii.35). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vetullaváda is generally identified with the Maháyána school of Buddhism. See Mhv. Trs. 259, n.2; also Hocart, Memoirs of the Archaeol. Survey of Ceylon, i.1922, p.15ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Vetulla Pitaka, the canon of the Vetullavádins, is condemned as abuddhavacana. E.g., SA.ii.150; cf. Sp.iv.742, where it is called Vedalha Pitaka.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

As in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/cuula_sakuladaayi_s')"&gt;Culla Sakuladáyí Suttas&lt;/a&gt;, the Buddha says that what Vekhanassa defines as perfection is merely a refinement of pleasure, and that only arahants can grasp the real meaning of perfection. Vekhanassa is annoyed, but the Buddha soothes him, and he becomes the Buddha's follower (M.ii.40ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the sutta Vekhanassa is called Kaccána. The Commentary (MA.ii.716) says that Vekhanassa visited the Buddha because he wished to discover for himself why his favourite pupil, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sakuladaayii')"&gt;Sakuludáyí&lt;/a&gt;, should have been defeated by the Buddha; he, therefore, travelled all the way from Rájagaha to Sávatthi, a distance of forty five leagues, to see the Buddha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

No one dared to enter the forest, fearing a lion and a tiger who roamed about there. So the people could not collect wood. One day the second tree sprite assumed an awful shape, in spite of the Bodhisatta's advice, and frightened away the lion and the tiger. The people, finding that they had disappeared, began cutting down the trees. Then the foolish tree sprite tried in vain to bring the animals back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kokaalika')"&gt;Kokálika's&lt;/a&gt; attempt to bring &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/saariputta')"&gt;Sáriputta&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/maha_moggallana_th')"&gt;Moggallána&lt;/a&gt; back, after having insulted them. Kokálika is identified with the foolish sprite, Sáriputta with the lion, and Moggallána with the tiger.

Sakka remains silent till the departure of Vepacitti. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, in reply to Mátali, Sakka says that the man who, when reviled, does not, in his turn, revile, wins a twofold victory.

When Moggallána visited Sakka to discover if he had fully understood the Buddha's teaching in the Cúlatanhá sankhaya Sutta, Sakka tried to evade his questions by showing him this palace. It has one hundred towers, each seven stories high, with seven nymphs in each storey, waited on by seven attendants. The palace appeared in Távatimsa on the day of Sakka's decisive victory over the Asuras. Moggallána allowed himself to be shown round, and then, with his big toe, he made the palace quake and rock. M.i.252f.; cf. Thag. 1196f.; ThagA.ii.184. The palace was also made to rock by the novice Sangharakkhita (q.v.) on the day he joined the Order (DA.ii.558). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The palace is one thousand leagues high, and is so called because it arose in the hour of victory (J.i.203). It is decked with banners, each three hundred leagues long   banners of gold on jewelled staffs and vice versa; and the whole palace is built of the seven precious substances. It arose as the result of the rest house built by Sakka, in his birth as Magha, for the use of the multitude (DhA.i.273; cf. DA.iii.698). When the Buddha visited Távatimsa with Nanda, Sakka was in the palace with his crimson footed (kakutapádiniyo) nymphs and came forward with them to greet him. The nymphs had given oil for the massaging of Kassapa Buddha's feet, hence the colour of their own feet. SNA.i.274.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When King Sádhína of Mithilá went to Távatimsa, he lived, according to human computation, seven hundred years in Vejayanta (J.iv.357).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Vejayantapásáda is illustrated on the Bharhut Tope. Cunningham, Bharhut Tope, p. 137.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Vejayanta.&lt;/b&gt; A chariot owned by Sakka, one hundred </data>
<data>and fifty leagues in length (DA.ii.481; SA.i.261; J.i.202), and drawn by one thousand horses, with Mátali as charioteer (S.i.224). Sakka rode into battle in this chariot (J.i.202), and it was sent to fetch distinguished humans to Távatimsa   e.g., Nimi, Guttila and Sádhína (q.v.). The Sudhábhojana Játaka (J.v.408f ) contains a description of the chariot with its pole of gold and its framework overlaid with gilt representations of various animals and birds. When the chariot travelled the whole world was filled with the sound of its wheels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Vejayanta.&lt;/b&gt; The chief of the eighty four thousand chariots owned by Mahásudassana (S.iii.145; D.ii.187). The navel of its wheels was made of sapphire, the spokes of seven kinds of precious things, the rim of coral, the axle of silver, etc.  SA.ii.237.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>
