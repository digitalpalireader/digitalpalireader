She married and became a devoted wife, accepting the Buddha's teaching, after hearing him preach at Vesāli.  Later she heard Pajāpatī Gotamī and wished to leave the world, but her husband refused his permission.  One day, while cooking, she developed the thought of impermanence and became an Anāgāmī.  When her husband realised this, he took her to Pajāpatī, who ordained her.

  <entry>[div class="huge"]Thūpārāma[/div][hr][p]1. Thūpārāma.-A monastery near the southern wall of Anurādhapura, erected by Devānampiyatissa.  The spot was consecrated by the Buddha having sat there in meditation (Mhv.i.82) and also by former Buddhas doing likewise (Mhv.xv.86).  The thūpa there was the first of its kind in Ceylon and enshrined the Buddha's collar-bone.  Miracles, said to have been ordained by the Buddha himself, attended its enshrinement (Mhv.xvii.30, 50).  The monastery was built later than the thūpa, hence its name (Mhv.xvii.62).  One of the eight saplings of the Bodhi-tree at Anurādhapura was planted in the grounds and exists to this day (Mhv.xix.61).  The Cittasālā was to the east of the Thūpārāma, and on that site Sanghamittā was cremated (Mhv.xx.52).  It was the monks of Thūpārāma who helped Thūlatthana to become king (Mhv.xxxiii.17).[/p][p]Lañjatissa levelled the ground between the Thūpārāma and the Mahā Thūpa (about four hundred yards away), made a stone mantling for the thūpa, and built a smaller thūpa to the east of it, near which he built the Lañjakāsana-hall (Mhv.xxxiii.23f).  Amandagāmani added an inner verandah to the uposatha-hall in the monastery (Mhv.xxxv.3), while Vasabha placed lamps round the thūpa and built a new uposatha-house (Mhv.xxxv.80, 87, 91).  Bhātika-Tissa erected another assembly-hall, while Gothābhaya made certain restorations (Mhv.xxxvi.4, 106).  The Sanghapāla-parivena probably formed part of the monastery (Mhv.xxxvi.114).[/p][p]Jetthatissa removed from the Thūpārāma the stone image placed there by Devānampiyatissa and set it up in Pācīnatissapabbata (Mhv.xxxvi.128).[/p][p]The renegade monk Sanghamitta once threatened to destroy the Thūpārāma but was killed in the attempt (Mhv.xxxvii.27).  Mahānāma provided a gold casing for the finial of the thūpa (Cv.xxxvii.207) and Dhātusena restored the thūpa (Mhv.xxxviii.70), while Aggabodhi II.  effected extensive repairs, almost rebuilding the whole structure (Mhv.xlii.51ff).  Dāthopatissa I.  did the monastery great damage, as did Kassapa II., though he afterwards made amends (Mhv.xliv.133, 138, 148).  Dāthopatissa II.  gave the village of Punnali to the Thūpārāma (Mhv.xlv.28), and Mānavamma built a pāsāda (Mhv.xlvii.66).  Aggabodhi VII.  repaired the doors and transposed the pillars of the structure round the cetiya (Cv.xlviii.65).  Mahinda II.  placed a casing of gold and silver plates in the cetiya (Cv.xlviii.140), while Dappula II.  covered the thūpaghara with golden bricks (Cv.xlix.81); both plates and bricks were later plundered by the Pandu king (Cv.l.35).  The golden plates were restored by Udaya II.  (Cv.li.128), and Sena Ilanga provided a building for the monks to the west of the Thūpārāma (Cv.lii.16).  Rakkha Ilanga did likewise (Cv.liii.11).  Mahinda IV.  covered the cetiya with strips of gold and silver, provided a golden door for the vihāra and instituted a great festival (Cv.liv.42f).  Vijayabāhu I., Parakkamabāhu I., and Vijayabāhu IV., successively, restored the buildings and effected necessary repairs (Cv.lx.56; lxxviii.107; lxxxviii.80).  The road into Anurādhapura passed by the southern gate of the Thūpārāma, eastwards and then northwards (UdA.238; VibhA.449).  From the Kadambanadī to the Thūpārāma the road lay through the gate of the Rājamātuvihāra (DA.ii.572).[/p][p]Behind the Thūpārāma was the Mahejjāvatthu.  It is said (Sp.i.86) that, at the time of Devānampiyatissa, there was in the Thūpārāma a shrine dedicated to the three Buddhas previous to Gotama.[/p][hr][p]2. Thūpārāma.-The name of a building in Pulatthipura.  The date of erection and name of the founder are unknown, but it probably existed before the time of Parakkamabāhu I (Cv.lx.56; Cv.

  <entry>[div class="huge"]Tilamutthi Jātaka (No.252)[/div][p]Brahmadatta, son of the king of Benares, was sent to Takkasilā to study.  One day, when going to bathe with his teacher, he ate some white seeds which an old woman had spread in the sun to dry.  He did this on three different days; on the third day the woman reported him to the teacher and he was beaten.  When Brahmadatta ascended the throne, be sent for the teacher, wishing to avenge this insult by killing him.  The teacher did not come until the king had grown older, but when he did arrive, the sight of him so rekindled the king's hatred, that he ordered him to be put to death.  But the teacher spoke to him, telling him that if he had not been corrected in his youth, he would today be a highway robber.  Convinced that the teacher's action had been due to a desire for his welfare, Brahmadatta asked his forgiveness and showed him all honour.[/p][p][/p][p]The story was told in reference to a monk who showed resentment when advised.

  <entry>[div class="huge"]Takka Jātaka (No.63)[/div][p]Once the Bodhisatta was an ascetic on the banks of the Ganges, from which he rescued Dutthakumārī, daughter of the setthi of Benares, who had been thrown into the flood during a storm by her long-suffering servants.  The ascetic succumbed to the wiles of Dutthakumārī and took up his abode with her in a village, where they earned their living by selling takka (curds or dates).  He therefore came to be called Takkapandita.  One day the village was looted by robbers, and they carried the woman away together with their booty.  Living happily with the robber chief, she feared that her former husband might come to claim her; she therefore sent for him with sweet words, planning to have him killed.[/p][p]While being beaten by the robber-chief, Takkapandita kept repeating, "Ungrateful wretches," and, on being asked the reason, related the story.  The robber thereupon killed the woman.[/p][p]Ananda is identified with the robber-chief.[/p][p][/p][p]The story was related to a passion-tossed monk (J.i.295-99).

He visited the Buddha at Sāvatthi and uttered certain verses in the hearing of the monks, telling of the necessity of following the recluse's calling with energy and sincerity.  After his departure the Buddha asked the monks to learn the verses for their own good (S.i.49).[/p][p][/p][p]The Commentary (SA.i.85) says that he was once a dissentient teacher, like Nanda, Vaccha, Kisa, Sankicca, etc., and taught some of the sixty-two views enumerated in the Brahmajāla Sutta.

Discovering that the partridge was the oldest of them, they honoured him as their teacher and he gave them counsel.  Their conduct came to be called the Tittiriya-brahmacariya.  The Bodhisatta was the partridge, Moggallāna the elephant, and Sāriputta the monkey.  [/p][p]The story was related in reference to the failure of the Chabbaggiyas to show due respect to Sāriputta.

Soon after, a partridge, who used to sing on an anthill near by, was killed by a fowler.  The Bodhisatta pointed out to his followers how the death of both was due to their talking too much.[/p][p]The story was told in reference to Kokalika, who is identified with the chattering ascetic.

Tittira Jātaka (No.438).[/b]-Once in Benares was a famous teacher who retired into the forest.  Men came from all parts to learn from him and brought him many presents.  He had in his house a tame partridge, who, by listening to the teacher's exposition, learnt the three Vedas by heart.  A tame lizard and a cow were given as presents to the teacher.  When the teacher died, his students were in despair, but were reassured by the partridge who taught them what he knew.  One day a wicked ascetic came to the hermitage and, in the absence of the students, killed the partridge, the young lizard and the cow.  The partridge had two friends, a lion and a tiger, who killed the murderer.[/p][p]The ascetic was Devadatta, the lizard Kisāgotamī, the tiger Moggallāna, the lion Sāriputta, the teacher Mahā Kassapa, and the partridge the Bodhisatta.

  <entry>[div class="huge"]Tacasāra Jātaka (No.368)[/div][p]Once a poor village doctor saw some boys playing near a tree, in the hollow of which lived a snake.  Hoping to make some money, he asked one of the boys, who was the Bodhisatta, to put his hand into the hollow of the tree, saying that a hedgehog lived there.  The boy did so, but, feeling the snake, with great presence of mind, he seized it firmly by the neck and flung it away from him.  The snake fell on the doctor and bit him so severely that he died.  The boys were brought before the king and charged, but on hearing the Bodhisatta's explanation the king released them.[/p][p][/p][p]The story was related to show how the Bodhisatta practised paññāpāramitā.

Amanda takes Tapassu to the Buddha, who is having his siesta at the foot of a tree in the Mahāvana, and repeats Tapassu's remark.  The Buddha tells Amanda how he himself had attained to Buddhahood by passing through the nine successive stages, the anupubbavihārā.  These nine stages consist of the four jhānas, the four āyatanas (ākāsānañcāyatana, etc.), and, as the crowning stage, the saññāvedayitanirodha (A.iv.438ff).[/p][p]The Tapassu mentioned is evidently identical with the brother of Bhalluka mentioned above.

The young stag followed his instruction diligently and one day, being caught in a net, he feigned death and so made his escape.[/p][p][/p][p]The story was told in reference to Rāhula.  Once, at the Aggālavacetiya, the Buddha, noticing that monks were in the habit of sleeping with novices in the preaching-hall after the sermon, he passed a rule making this a pācittiya-offence.  As a result, Rāhula could find no lodging and spent the night in the Buddha's jakes, not wishing to transgress the rule.  The Buddha, discovering this, assembled the monks and blamed them for their thoughtlessness, for if they thus treated his son, what might they not do to the other novices.  The rule about lodgings was thereupon modified.  The story was related to show Rāhula's diligence in following rules (J.i.160ff; cp.

Near their dwelling place was a village where grew a tinduka tree, whose sweet fruits were eaten by the monkeys.  But the people came and built a village near the tree and the monkeys could no longer take the fruit.  One night, when the villagers were asleep, they crept up to the tree and began eating the fruit.  A villager gave the alarm and the monkeys were in great danger of being slain when dawn came.  But the Bodhisatta comforted them and kept them in good humour until they were rescued by his nephew, Senaka, who set fire to the village, distracting the attention of the people, thus allowing the monkeys to escape.

  <entry>[div class="huge"]Tandulanāli Jātaka (No.5)[/div][p]Once the Bodhisatta was appraiser to the king of Benares, with whom he always dealt fairly.  The king was greedy, and thinking that his appraiser paid too much for things bought for the palace, he appointed in his place a rustic, whom he happened to see passing.  This man fixed prices according to his own fancy.  One day a dealer brought five hundred horses from Uttarāpatha, and the appraiser valued the whole lot at a single measure of rice.  The horse-dealer sought the Bodhisatta's advice, who suggested that the appraiser should be asked to value a measure of rice.  The horse-dealer went to the king, and, in the presence of the court, asked the appraiser the value of one measure of rice.  The man replied that it was worth all Benares and its suburbs.  The ministers laughed, thus putting the king to shame.  He dismissed the fool and reinstated the Bodhisatta.[/p][p][/p][p]The story was told in reference to Lāludāyi, who had a dispute with Dabba Mallaputta regarding the distribution of food tickets.  The monks thereupon asked Lāludāyi to undertake the task.  This he did so badly that great confusion ensued, and the matter was reported to the Buddha, who related the above story to show that in the past, too, his stupidity had deprived others of their profit.[/p][p][/p][p]Lāludāyi is identified with the false appraiser.

[/p][p]The chief difference between these two worlds seems to have been that the Pāricchattaka tree grew in Tāvatimsa, and the Cittapātali tree in Asurabhavana.  In order that the Asuras should not enter Tāvatimsa, Sakka had five walls built around it, and these were guarded by  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/n/naaga,Nāgas')"]Nāgas[/a], [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/g/garudaa,Supannas')"]Supannas[/a],  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kumbhanda,Kumbhandas')"]Kumbhandas[/a],  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/y/yakkha,Yakkhas')"]Yakkhas[/a] and Cātummahārājika devas (J.i.201ff; also DhA.i.272f).  The entrance to Tāvatimsa was by way of the Cittakūtadvārakotthaka, on either side of which statues of Indra (Indapatimā) kept guard (J.vi.97).  The whole kingdom was ten thousand leagues in extent (DhA.i.273), and contained more than one thousand pāsādas (J.vi.279).  The chief features of Tāvatimsa were its parks - the Phārusaka, Cittalatā, Missaka and Nandana - the Vejayantapāsāda, the Pāricchatta tree, the elephant-king Erāvana and the Assembly-hall Sudhammā (J.vi.278; MA.i.183; cp.  Mtu.i.32).  Mention is also made of a park called Nandā (J.i.204).  Besides the Pāricchataka (or Pārijāta) flower, which is described as a Kovilāra (A.iv.117), the divine Kakkāru flower also grew in Tāvatimsa (J.iii.87).  In the Cittalatāvana grows the Āsāvatī creeper, which blossoms once in a thousand years (J.iii.250f).[/p][p]It is the custom of all Buddhas to spend the vassa following the performance of the  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/y/yamaka_paatihaariya,Yamakapātihāriya')"]Yamakapātihāriya[/a], in Tāvatimsa.

Eighty crores of devas attained to a knowledge of the truth.  This was in the seventh year after his Enlightenment (J.iv.265; DhA.iii.216f; BuA.  p.3).  It seems to have been the frequent custom of ascetics, possessed of iddhi-power, to spend the afternoon in Tāvatimsa (E.g., Nārada, J.vi.392; and Kāladevala, J.i.54).[/p][p] [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/maha_moggallana_th,Moggallāna')"]Moggallāna[/a] paid numerous visits to Tāvatimsa, where he learnt from those dwelling there stories of their past deeds, that he might repeat them to men on earth for their edification (VvA.  p.4).[/p][p]The Jātaka Commentary mentions several human beings who were invited by Sakka, and who were conveyed to Tāvatimsa - e.g.  Nimi, Guttila, Mandhātā and the queen Sīlavatī.  Mandhātā reigned as co-ruler of Tāvatimsa during the life period of thirty-six Sakkas, sixty thousand years (J.ii.312).  The inhabitants of Tāvatimsa are thirty-three in number, and they regularly meet in the Sudhammā Hall.  (See  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/sudhammaa,Sudhammā')"]Sudhammā[/a] for details).  A description of such an assembly is found in the Janavasabha Sutta.  The Cātummahārājika Devas (q.v.) are present to act as guards.  Inhabitants of other deva- and brahma-worlds seemed sometimes to have been present as guests - e.g.  the Brahmā Sanankumāra, who came in the guise of Pañcasikha.  From the description given in the sutta, all the inhabitants of Tāvatimsa seem to have been followers of the Buddha, deeply devoted to his teachings (D.ii.207ff).  Their chief place of offering was the Cūlāmanicetiya, in which Sakka deposited the hair of Prince Siddhattha, cut off by him when he renounced the world and put on the garments of a recluse on the banks of the Nerañjarā (J.i.65).  Later, Sakka deposited here also the eye-tooth of the Buddha, which Doha hid in his turban, hoping to keep it for himself (DA.ii.609; Bu.xxviii.6, 10).[/p][p]The gods of Tāvatimsa sometimes come to earth to take part in human festivities (J.iii.87).  Thus Sakka, Vissakamma and Mātali are mentioned as having visited the earth on various occasions.  Mention is also made of goddesses from Tāvatimsa coming to bathe in the Anotatta and then spending the rest of the day on the Manosilātala (J.v.392).[/p][p]The capital city of Tāvatimsa was Masakkasāra (Ibid., p.400).  The average age of an inhabitant of Tāvatimsa is thirty million years, reckoned by human computation.  Each day in Tāvatimsa is equal in time to one hundred years on earth (DhA.i.364).  The gods of Tāvatimsa are most handsome; the Licchavis, among earth-dwellers, are compared to them (DhA.iii.280).  The stature of some of the Tāvatimsa dwellers is three-quarters of a league; their undergarment is a robe of twelve leagues and their upper garment also a robe of twelve leagues.  They live in mansions of gold, thirty leagues in extent (Ibid., p.8).  The Commentaries (E.g., SA.i.23; AA.i.377) say that Tāvatimsa was named after Magha and his thirty-two companions, who were born there as a result of their good deeds in Macalagāma.  Whether the number of the chief inhabitants of this world always remained at thirty-three, it is impossible to say, though some passages, e.g.  in the Janavasabha Sutta, lead us to suppose so.[/p][p]Sometimes, as in the case of Nandiya, who built the great monastery at Isipatana, a mansion would appear in Tāvatimsa, when an earth-dweller did a good deed capable of obtaining for him birth in this deva-world; but this mansion would remain unoccupied till his human life came to an end (DhA.iii.291).  There were evidently no female devas among the Thirty-three.  Both Māyā and Gopikā (q.v.) became devaputtas when born in Tāvatimsa.  The women there were probably the attendants of the devas.  (But see, e.g., Jālini and the various stories of VvA).[/p][p]There were many others besides the Thirty-three who had their abode in Tāvatimsa.  Each deva had numerous retinues of attendants, and the dove-footed (kaktgapādiniyo) nymphs (accharā) of Tāvatimsa are famous in literature for their delicate beauty.  The sight of these made Nanda, when escorted by the Buddha to Tāvatimsa, renounce his love for Janapadakalyānī Nandā (J.ii.92; Ud.iii.2).[/p][p]The people of Jambudīpa excelled the devas of Tāvatimsa in courage, mindfulness and piety (A.iv.396).  Among the great achievements of Asadisakumāra was the shooting of an arrow as far as Tāvatimsa (J.ii.89).[/p][p]Tāvatimsa was also known as Tidasa and Tidiva (q.v.).[/p][hr]</entry>

Thereupon, he set out with five of his brothers who wished to accompany him.  On the way through the forest the five in succession succumbed to the charms of the ogresses, and were devoured.  One ogress followed the Bodhisatta right up to the gates of Takkasilā, where the king took her into the palace, paying no heed to the Bodhisatta's warning.  The king succumbed to her wiles, and, during the night, the king and all the inhabitants of the palace were eaten by the ogress and her companions.  The people, realising the sagacity and strength of will of the Bodhisatta, made him their king.[/p][p][/p][p]The story was related in reference to the Janapada-Kalyāni Sutta (q.v.).

Tacchasūkara made all the preparations for a counter-attack, digging pits and training all the members of the herd in their various duties, and their several positions at the time of attack.  Under his guidance they succeeded in killing the tiger and greedily devouring the corpse.  Tacchasūkara was told that there was a sham ascetic who had helped the tiger to eat the boars.  The herd attacked the ascetic, who climbed up a fig-tree, but they uprooted the tree and devoured him.  They consecrated Tacchasūkara as their king, making him sit on a fig-tree, and sprinkling water on him from a conch-shell, with its spirals turned right-wise, which the ascetic had used for drinking.  [/p][p][/p][p]Hence arose the custom of seating the king on a chair of figwood and sprinkling him with water from a conch-shell at his coronation.  The story was related in connection with the Thera Dhanuggahatissa (q.v.).  Spies of Pasenadi had heard him discuss with the Thera Datta the plan of campaign which should be adopted if Pasenadi wished to defeat Ajātasattu.  This was repeated to Pasenadi, who followed the suggestion and captured Ajātasattu.  [/p][p][/p][p]Dhanuggahatissa is identified with Tacchasūkara.  J.iv.342ff.[/p][hr]</entry>

The place was called Kammāsadamma because it was here that the man-eating ogre,  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kammasapaada,Kammāsapāda')"]Kammāsapāda[/a] was tamed and civilized by the Bodhisatta.  (Kammāso ettha damito ti, Kammāsadamam-Kammāso ti Kammāsapādo porisādo vuccati.)

Mahākammāsadamma, which was evidently the original place, was founded on the spot where the porisāda of the  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahasutasoma_jat_537,Mahāsutasoma Jātaka')"]Mahāsutasoma Jātaka[/a] was tamed (J.v.411), while Cūlakammāsadamma was the name given to the place where  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/j/jayaddisa_jat_513,Jayaddisa')"]Jayaddisa[/a] showed his prowess by his spiritual victory over the ogre in the  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/j/jayaddisa_jat_513,Jayaddisa Jātaka')"]Jayaddisa Jātaka[/a] (J.v.35f).[/p][p][/p][p]In the Divyāvadāna (pp.515f), the place is called Kammāsadamya.

  <entry>[div class="huge"]Kālacampā[/div][p]A city in Anga; it was sixty leagues from Mithilā, with which it was connected by a cart-road (J.vi.31f).  To Kālacampā came sages from the Himalaya to procure salt and sour condiments (J.vi.256).  There lived Punnaka's relations (J.vi.274).  Varuna, the Nāga king, tells Vidhūra that he (Varuna) and his wife were once inhabitants of Kālacampā (J.vi.317).  Kālacampā is probably another name for Campā (q.v.); in fact, the name Campā is used more than once in reference to Kālacampā (E.g., J.vi.32).  According to the Anguttara Commentary (AA.i.131), Sona Kolivisa was born in Kālacampā; the Theragāthā Commentary (ThagA.i.544), however, speaks of his birthplace as Campā.[/p][hr]</entry>
  <entry>[div class="huge"]Kāsi [/div][hr][p][b]1. Kāsi (Kāsika).[/b]-One of the sixteen Mahājanapadas (A.i.213, etc.), its capital being  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/baranasi,Bārānasī')"]Bārānasī[/a].  [/p][p]At the time of the Buddha, it had been absorbed into the kingdom of Kosala, and Pasenadi was king of both countries (D.i.288; M.ii.111).  The Mahāvagga (Vin.i.28l), however, mentions a Kāsika-rājā (king of Kāsi?) who sent a robe to Jīvaka.  Buddhaghosa (see Vinaya Texts ii.195, n.2) says that this was a brother of Pasenadi and son of the same father.  He was probably a sub-king of Pasenadi.  Pasenadi's father, Mahākosala, on giving his daughter in marriage to Bimbisāra, allotted her a village of Kāsi (Kāsigāma, q.v.) as bath money (J.iv.342; J.ii.403; SA.i.110,120f, etc.).  Even at this time, however, the memory of Kāsi as an independent kingdom seems to have been still fresh in men's minds.  It is very frequently mentioned as such in the Jātakas and elsewhere.  Kāsi was once ruled by the Bhāratas, one of whom, Dhatarattha, was its king in the time of Renu (D.ii.235f).  There seem to have been frequent wars between the countries of Kāsi and Kosala, victory belonging now to one, now to the other.  In one such war, Dīghāti (q.v.), the Kosala king, was defeated by the king of Kāsi, but Dīghīti's son Dīghāvu won back the kingdom (Vin.i.334; J.iii.487; DhA.i.46).  In another war the Kāsi king, Mahāsīlava, was taken captive by the ruler of Kosala, but his kingdom was later restored to him (J.i.262, etc.; see also i.409; UdA.123).[/p][p]The traditional name of the king of Kāsi from time immemorial was evidently Brahmadatta (q.v.), and references to kings of that name abound in the Jātakas.  Sometimes the king is referred to merely as Kāsi-rājā.  Among other kings of Kāsi mentioned are Kikī (M.ii.49) and Kalābu (J.iii.39).  The extent of the Kāsi kingdom is given as three hundred leagues (J.v.41; also iii.304, 391).[/p][p]The capital of Kāsi is generally given as Bārānasī, but it is said that when Asoka was king of Kāsi his capital was in Potali (J.iii.155), and another king, Udaya-bhadda, had his seat of government in Surundha (J.iv.104ff).  It is possible that these cities did not form part of the regular kingdom of Kāsi, but became annexed to it during the reigns of some of the more powerful kings.[/p][p]Kāsi was evidently a great centre of trade and a most populous and prosperous country.  Frequent mention is made of caravans leaving Kāsi to travel for trade.  One highway went through Kāsi to Rājagaha (Vin.i.212) and another to Sāvatthi (Vin.ii.10; Mhv.v.114).  Kāsi was famed for her silks, and Kāsi-robes were most highly esteemed as gifts, each robe being valued at one hundred thousand.  (See, e.g., J.vi.151, 450; see also Addhakāsi).  Mention is also made of the perfumes of Kāsi (Kāsi-vilepana (J.i.355) and Kāsi-candana (A.iii.391; UdA.332)).[/p][p]Besides those already referred to, other names of places mentioned in literature as belonging to Kāsi, are Vāsabhagāma, Macchikāsanda (the kammantagāma of Anāthapindika), Kītāgiri and Dhammapālagāma (q.v.).  Kāsi and Kosala are frequently mentioned together.  (E.g., A.v.59).[/p][hr][p][b]2. Kāsi, or Kāsika.[/b]-A city, the birthplace of Phussa Buddha (Bu.xix.14; J.i.41).  There he preached the Buddhavamsa (BuA.193).  The city is probably to be identified with Benares, which is sometimes referred to as Kāsipura (E.g., DhA.i.71; J.v.54; vi.165; M.i.171; DhsA.35; Cv.xli.37).

Later he went into the Dekkhan and, having learnt mystic verses, became a mighty seer.  Coming back to Okkāka, Kanha demanded the hand of the king's daughter Maddarūpī.  At first the request was indignantly refused, but when Kanha displayed his supernatural powers he gained the princess.  D.i.96f.; DA.i.266.[/p][p][/p][p]5.

When the sons of Okkāka went into voluntary exile and were looking for a spot on which to found a city, they came upon Kapila in his hermitage in Himavā by the side of a lake.  He was versed in the science of Bhūmicāla, and was, therefore, acquainted with the qualities associated with various sites.  He knew that any city built on the site of his hermitage would become the capital of Jambudīpa and that its inhabitants would be invincible.  He therefore advised them to found a settlement there.  They followed his advice and named the settlement Kapilavatthu after him (q.v.).  A hermitage was built near it for the use of Kapila.

Kapila learnt the three Pitakas and, intoxicated with his learning, disagreed with everybody, right or wrong.  He would heed no admonition, and followed a life of evil conduct in which he was followed by his mother and sister.  One day, when Kapila was reciting the Pātimokkha, none of the other monks gave the responses, and in anger he declared that there was neither Dhamma nor Vinaya.  Thus he put obstacles in the way of religion, and was reborn in Avīci.

Sunakkhatta once visited him and asked him questions, but Kalāramatthuka would not listen, and showed resentment at being interrogated.  When Sunakkhatta reported this to the Buddha, the Buddha predicted that the ascetic would, before long, wear garments, be married, eat rice and gruel, go beyond the limits he had until now observed, and fall in fame.

  <entry>[div class="huge"]Kanhadīpāyana Jātaka (No.444)[/div][p]During the reign of Kosambika in Kosambī, two brahmins, Dīpāyana and Mandavya, gave away their vast wealth and lived for fifty years as ascetics in Himavā.  After that, while on a pilgrimage to Benares, they were entertained by a householder who was also named Mandavya.  Dīpāyana journeyed on while the ascetic Mandavya remained in a cemetery near Benares.  There some robbers left some stolen goods outside his hut, and Mandavya, being charged before the king, was impaled, but by virtue of his great powers he continued to live.  Dīpāyana came to see his friend, and finding him thus and learning that he bore no ill-will towards anyone, took up his abode under his impaled body.  Gouts of gore fell from Mandavya's wound on to Dīpāyana's golden body and there dried, forming black spots; so he came to be called Kanha-Dīpāyana.  When the king heard of this, he had Mandavya released with a piece of the stake still inside him, on account of which he came to be called Āni-Mandavya.  Dīpāyana returned to the householder Mandavya, whose son Yaññadatta he helped to heal by an Act of Truth, the child having been bitten by a snake while playing ball.  The lad's parents then performed acts of Truth.  In this declaration of Truth it was disclosed that Dīpāyana had no desire for the ascetic life, that the father did not believe in the fruits of generosity, and that the mother had no love for her husband.  They thereupon admonished each other and agreed to mend their ways.[/p][p]The Mandavya of the story was Ananda, his wife Visākhā, the son Rāhula, Āni-Mandavya Sāriputta and Kanha-Dīpāyana the Bodhisatta (J.iv.27ff).

After several births, in which each, alternately, devoured the children of the other, the second wife became an ogress named Kālī and the first wife was born in a good family.  Twice the ogress ate the latter's children; on the third occasion Kālī was occupied in Vessavana's service and the child was left unhurt.  On his naming day the parents took him to Jetavana, and there, as the mother was giving suck to her child, while her husband bathed in the monastery pool, she saw the ogress and, being terrified, dashed into the monastery where the Buddha was preaching.  The guardian deity, Sumana, prevented Kālī's entrance, but the Buddha, having heard the story, sent for Kālī and preached to her, whereupon she became a sotāpanna.  The Buddha persuaded the two women to become friends, and Kālī lived in the house of the other; but being uncomfortable there and at various other lodgings provided for her, she ultimately lived outside the village.

  <entry>[div class="huge"]Kākavanna-Tissa (Kākavanna)[/div][p]A king of the Rohana dynasty in Ceylon.  He was the great-grandson of Mahānāga, brother of Devānampiya-Tissa, and his father was Gothābhaya (Mhv.xv.170f; Mbv.132).  His capital was at Mahāgāma.  He had as wife, Devī (better known as Vihāradevī), daughter of Tissa, king of Kalyāni, who had been cast into the sea to expiate her father's crimes (Mhv.xxii.20ff).  Their children were Dutthagāmani Abhaya and Saddhā-Tissa.  Kākavanna-Tissa gathered round him all the foremost Sinhalese warriors of the time so that they should be available for Gāmani, when the time came for his campaign against the Damilas (Mhv.xxiii.2).[/p][p][/p][p]But at the start Kākavanna-Tissa was very reluctant to allow his son to make preparations for such a campaign (Mhv.xxii.82f), so much so that, in exasperation, the young prince once sent his father some female ornaments to indicate that the king was no man (Mhv.xxiv.4).  Kākavanna-Tissa was very pious, and is said to have built sixty-four vihāras, sixty-four years being also the length of his reign (Mhv.xxiv.12; see also AA.i.279).  Among the religious edifices built by him were the Tissamahārāma, the Cittalapabbatavihāra (Mhv.xxii.23) and the Mahānuggala Cetiya.  He was cremated at Tissamahārāma (xxiv.8, 13).  He evidently received his name on account of his dark colour.  The Dīpavamsa (Dpv.xviii.20; were their names Mahilā and Samantā?; see also xix.21f) speaks of Kākavanna-Tissa's daughters as having been proficient in the history of the, Religion (saddhammavamsakovidā).[/p][p][/p][p]He was once a milakkka in India and looked after a Pacceka Buddha.  One day he gave the Pacceka Buddha a meal of ripe jack-fruit.  On another occasion, when the Pacceka Buddha visited his house in his absence, his wife tried to tempt him.  Having failed, she complained to the husband that the Pacceka Buddha had assaulted her.  The latter sought the Pacceka Buddha to kill him, but, seeing him in mid air putting on his robe, he was filled with wonder and asked the Pacceka Buddha's forgiveness.  Later he was born in a hunters' village near Amaruppala-lena, his name being Amaruppala, and did various good deeds.[/p][p][/p][p]He was called Kākavanna-Tissa because he knew the speech of crows.

  <entry>[div class="huge"]Kathā-Vatthu[/div][p]The fifth of the seven books of the Abhidhamma Pitaka.  (Sometimes called the third, e.g., in Mbv.94).  It seems to have been compiled when the contents of at least the Dhammasanganī, the Vibhanga and Patthāna were already accepted as orthodox.  Tradition ascribes its compilation to Moggaliputta-Tissa at the end of the Third Council, held under Asoka's patronage; at Pātaliputta (Mhv.v.278; Dpv.vii.41, 56-8).  It was rejected by some on the ground that it was set forth two hundred and eighteen years after the Buddha's death, and was hence only a disciple's utterance; but the Commentaries take the view that the mātikā, the principles taught therein, were laid down by the Teacher himself, and that the whole work should be regarded as the utterance of the Buddha, just as the Madhu-pindika Sutta, preached really by Mahā-Kaccāna, is considered as the Buddha's teaching.  The book consists of twenty-three chapters, and is a collection of discussions (kathā) and refutations of the heretical views of various sects on matters connected with theology and philosophy.  The Buddha's authority is accepted as final.  See the very valuable Preface to the Points of Controversy, by Mrs.  Rhys Davids, vii ff See also Rhys Davids on "Questions discussed in the Kathā-Vatthu," J.R.A.S.1892.[/p][p][/p][p]It has sometimes been suggested (E.g., J.R.A.S.1915, 805ff ) that Asoka's Rock Edict IX.  has been influenced by the Kathā-Vatthu.  The Therī Khemā, chief of the Buddha's women disciples, describes herself as being "Kathāvatthuvisāradā," (ThigA.135) thus strengthening the theory that the Kathā-Vatthu was known already in the Buddha's time.[/p][p]The Udāna Commentary (UdA.94) refers to a Kathāvatthupakarana-Tika for details of certain points raised.[/p][hr]</entry>

To remedy this shortcoming emperor Shomu tried to invite an able teacher from China.  For this purpose he, in 738 A.C.  sent out the two monks Eiei and Fusho to China.  These two met Kanjin and invited him to Japan.  But as the reigning Chinese emperor was not favourably disposed towards Buddhism, Kanjin could not obtain imperial sanction for this journey.  However, Kanjin being determined to make the trip secretly made several unsuccessful attempts to sail to Japan.  It is said that on the fifth attempt he lost his sight.  Yet, undaunted he tried once more and successfully reached Japan in April 754 A.C.  He is said to have been accompanied by fourteen monks, three nuns and twenty-four lay male disciples.  Kanjin and his followers are said to have brought along with them a number of vinaya commentaries and important texts of the Tendai School.[/p][p]On his arrival in Japan Kanjin was ceremonially received by Shomu and a special monastery called Toshodaiji was built for his residence.  At Kanjin's request a special Ordination Hall (kaidān), the first of its kind in Japan, was built in the precincts of the Todaiji temple in Nara.[/p][p]The establishment of the kaidan at Todaiji in Nara is a significant event in the history of Japanese Buddhism.  At the first ordination ceremony itself over fourhundred are said to have taken part.  Since the kaidan was at Nara all who wished to obtain ordination had to go there.  Official permission was not granted to establish any kaidan outside Nara, and hence, schools of Buddhism that prevailed at Nara enjoyed an almost monopolistic influence over the ordination.  This was finally put to an end only by the zealous efforts of Degyo Daishi.  [/p][hr]</entry>

The Bodhisatta took his body to the village and preached to the villagers.[/p][p]The story was told to a young man of Sāvatthi who, when the plague broke out in his house, listened to his parents' advice and escaped through a hole in the wall.

  <entry>[div class="huge"]Kalandakanivāpa[/div][p]A woodland in Veluvana.  Here food (nivāpa) was regularly placed for the squirrels.  It is said that once a certain raja went there for a picnic and, having over-drunk, fell asleep.  His retinue, seeing him sleeping, wandered away, looking for flowers and fruits.  A snake, attracted by the smell of liquor, approached the king from a neighbouring tree-trunk, and would have bitten him had not a tree-sprite, assuming the form of a squirrel, awakened him by her chirping.  In gratitude the rājā gave orders that thenceforth the squirrels in that locality should be fed regularly.  UdA.60; SnA.ii.419. According to some, it was the gift of a merchant named Kalandaka (Beal: Romantic Legend, p.315); Tibetan sources identify the rājā with Bimbisāra and say that the snake was a reincarnation of the owner whose land the king had confiscated.  According to these same sources the name is Kalantaka and is described as the name of a bird (Rockhill: op.  cit., p.43).[/p][p]Kalandakanivāpa was evidently a favourite resort of the Buddha and his monks.[/p][p]See Veluvana.[/p][hr]</entry>

  <entry>[div class="huge"]Kandaraka Sutta[/div][p]Once, when the Buddha was at Campā, on the banks of Lake Gaggarā, he was visited by Pessa, the elephant trainer's son, and Kandaraka, the Wanderer.  Pessa saluted the Buddha and sat down, while Kandaraka, after his salutation, remained standing.  Surveying the assembly of monks gathered round the Buddha and observing their great silence, Kandaraka expressed his admiration of the Buddha's training.  The Buddha explained that all Buddhas school their disciples in the four satipatthānas.  Pessa stated that it was far more difficult to train men than animals.  The Buddha agreed and enumerated the four kinds of people in the world: those who torment themselves, torment others, torment both themselves and others, and, lastly, those who torment neither, dwelling beyond appetites, in bliss and holiness.  Pessa stated that he respected only the fourth class, and having given his reasons went away.  The Buddha expressed his regret that Pessa could not wait to hear the differences between these four kinds of people; and at the request of the monks the Buddha proceeded to describe them (M.i.339ff).[/p][hr]</entry>

One morning early he saw Pingiyānī evidently returning from somewhere, and on inquiry learnt that he had been to see the Buddha.  Kāranapālī asked him what he thought of the Buddha, and Pingiyānī sang his praises, illustrating his meaning with various figures of speech.  Convinced by Pingiyānī's earnestness, Kāranapālī knelt on the ground and expressed his homage to the Buddha (A.iii.236ff).[/p][p][/p][p]The Commentary (AA.ii.636) says that the man's name was Pāla (or Pālī), and he was called Kāranapālī because he supervised the business of various chieftains' families.[/p][hr]</entry>

He was "of good stock, well informed, a good speaker and a scholar of ability." He visited the Buddha at Opasāda, where he interrupted a conversation which the Buddha was holding with some aged brahmins; they rebuked him for interrupting his elders, but Cankī (q.v.), who happened to arrive at that moment, interceded on his behalf.  The Buddha, knowing that Kāpathika had questions to ask of him, gave him an opportunity for so doing, and there followed a discussion on various points, detailed in the Cankī Sutta.  At the end of the discussion the youth declared himself a disciple of the Buddha (M.ii.168ff).  In the Sutta the Buddha addresses Kāpathika as Bhāradvāja, perhaps because he belonged to that gotta.[/p][hr]</entry>
  <entry>[div class="huge"]Kāñcipura (v.l.  Kāñcīpura)[/div][p]A city in Southern India on the Coromandel coast, capital of the Pallavas, and one of the seven sacred towns of India; it is the modern Conjevaram.  It was once the centre of Buddhism in South India and was one of the places of pilgrimage visited by Hiouien Thsang.  He mentions that during his stay there three hundred monks came to Kāñcipura from Ceylon, fleeing from the political disturbances in that country (Beal, op.  cit., ii.228f; CAGI.627).  In Pali Literature the locality is noteworthy as the birthplace of the Commentator Dhammapāla and perhaps also of Anuruddha, author of the Abhidhammattha-Sangaha (P.L.C.113, 169).  Some identify Kāñcipura with Satiyaputta of Asoka's Rock Edict II.  E.g., J.R.A.S., 1918, 541f; see also Bhandarkar, Anct.  Hist.  of Deccan pp.47, 52.[/p][hr]</entry>

When Vessantara retired to the forest, his wife and children accompanied him to Vankagiri.  Later, both Kanhājinā and her brother Jāli were given to Jūjaka as slaves and were ill-treated by him.  For sixty leagues they travelled with him, led and guarded by the gods, till they came to the court of their grandfather Sañjaya, king of Sivi, and there they were released, Kanhājinā's price being one hundred elephants, one hundred male and female slaves, etc.  The children afterwards rejoined their parents and lived happily at the court (J.vi.513ff).[/p][p]Kanhājinā is identified with Uppalavannā (J.vi.593).

They are the very lowest of the Asura groups, and the Buddha warns Sunakkhatta that Korakkhattiya will, after his death from epilepsy, be born among them; and it did so happen (D.iii.7f; J.i.389).  Bodhisattas are never born among the Kālakañjakas (J.i.44; BuA.224).  Sometimes (E.g., J.v.187; PvA.272), when Asuras are mentioned, the Commentaries explain the word as meaning the Kālakañjakas.  Beings born among them suffer from excessive thirst, which they are unable to quench even by immersing themselves in the Ganges.  (For a story of one of them see VibhA.5).

Men asked for these flowers, but the gods explained that they could only be worn by those possessed of certain virtues.  The king's chaplain, hoping to deceive the gods, claimed possession of these virtues.  The wreath was put on his head and the gods disappeared.  The chaplain was seized with great pain in his head, but on trying to remove the wreath he found it impossible to do so.  When he had suffered for seven days, the king, hoping to save his life, held another similar festival at which the gods were again present.  The chaplain confessed his guilt and obtained relief.

  <entry>[div class="huge"]Kaniska[/div][p]The great Kusāna king of India, a renowned patron of Buddhism.  His name is spelt as Kāniska in inscriptions.  On coins it appears, in Greek script, as Kanérki, or in the genitive Kanerkou which some scholars read as Kanéshki and Kanéshkou.  Kasmir tradition gives the variant Kanistha which become Kanit'a in Chinese.  Alberuni refers to him as Kanik [a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title][/a].[/p][p]There are different theories regarding the nationality of Kaniska.  It is widely accepted that he is of Yuch-chi origin.  It is said that during the 2nd century B.C.  the Yuch-chi, a Mongoloid nomadic tribe of Central Asia, was forced out of their pasture lands by their more powerful neighbours, the Hiung-nu.  Being thus driven out they migrated westwards and in the course of their migration conquered the Wu sun tribe and settled down in the basin of the lliriver.  Here they were divided into two branches of which the minor branch (Siao-yueh-chi) deflected southwards and settled down along the Tibetan border while the major branch (Ta-yueh-chi) proceeded forwards, defeated the Sakas and settled down in the conquered territory.  From there they were again expelled by the son of the dead Wu sun chieftain.  Resuming their march, they finally occupied Bactria and Sogdiana and by about the 1st century B.C.  gave up their nomadic habits and adopted a more settled life, Here they were divided into five groups of whom the Kusānas (Kueishuang) overpowered the rest and united the whole tribe under Kadphises I (i.e., Kujula Kadphises) who captured some regions of North West India.  He was succeeded by his son Kadphises II (i.e., Wima Kadphises) who annexed further Indian territory.  Kaniska, whos connection with Kadphises II is not known, is said to have succeeded him.  [/p][p][/p][p]Sten Konow and Fleet consider that Kaniska belonged to a separate clan of the Kusānas which originated from Khotan.  B.N.  Puri[span class="MsoEndnoteReference"] [a href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title][![if !supportFootnotes]][5][/a][span class="MsoEndnoteReference"][span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman"][![endif]]says that the Kusāna and the Yueh-chi are two different racial groups and that the former is of Iranian Saka stock while the latter is of Mongoloid origin.[/div][div class="Section2"][p][/p][p]There is no consensus among scholars regarding the date of Kaniska.  The earliest and the latest dates assigned to his accession are 5 B.C.  and 278 A.C.  S Levi suggested 5 B.C. Fleet who places it in 58 B.C.  also considers him to be the founder of the Vikrama Samvat.  According to Professor Van Lohuizen de Leeuw Kaniska acceded to the throne between 71-86 A.C. Cunningham places him in 80 A.C.Fergusson, Oldenberg, Rapson, Thomas, Banerji,Jayaswal, and later, even Marshal and Levi place Kaniska in 78 A.C.  and some of them regard him also as the founder of the Saka era.  Vincent Smith, Sten Konow favours one of the two dates 120 or 128-29 A.C.Ghirshman suggests the date 144 A.C.  which is endorsed by Benjamin Rowland and B.N Puri.  The date put forward by R.C.  Majumdar is 248 A.C. D.R.  Bhandarkar first suggested 278 A.C.  but later adopted 128 A.C.[/p][p][/p][p]Of these numerous dates the most widely accepted is 78 A.C.  though some modern scholars like Benjamin Rowland and B.N.  Puri prefer the date 144 on the ground that the latest archaeological discoveries made at Begram in Afghanistan by Ghrishman add more weight to it.[/p][p][/p][p]The view put forward by Fleet, and supported by R.  Otto Franke and J.  Kennedy, that Kaniska preceded the two Kadphises, is no longer held as valid.  The excavation done at Taxila has shown that the coins of the Kaniska group of the Kusāna kings were found in the upper (i.e.  later) strata of earth while those of the Kadphises group were in the lower (i.e., earlier) strata.  The connection between Kadphises II and Kaniska is not known.  However, the evidence provided by the coin finds in which the coins of Kadphises II and Kaniska were found together proves that they were close to each other in time.  It is plausible to hold that Kaniska succeeded Kadphises II after a short interregnum.[/p][p][/p][p]It is quite certain that Kaniska succeeded to a fairly large kingdom of Kadphises II.  He expanded this kingdom by annexing more territory both in India and in Central Asia.  Inscriptions of Kaniska found at Kosam (Allahabad), Sarnath, Mathura, Sui-vihar (Bhavalpur), Zeda (Und), Manikiala (Rawalpindj) and his coins, found in Bihar and Pātaliputta, suggest that he ruled over a vast Indian territory.  Chinese and Tibetan tradition record that he conquered Sāketa and Magadha and carried off the eminent Buddhist scholar Asvaghosa.  He also conquered Kashmir, Punjab and Sind.  In Kashmir he erected numerous monuments and founded a city called Kaniskapura, now represented by the village Kanispor.  Outside India his rule extended to Afghanistan, Bactria, Kashgar, Khotan and Yarkand.[/p][p]Though he seems to have cherished a marked preference for Kashmir he had his capital at Purusapura, the modern Peshawar which lay in the main route from Afghanistan to the Indus plain.[/p][p]Kaniska was a renowned warrior.  His most daring military feat is his conquest of Kashgar, Yarkand and Khotan, which were dependencies of China, Kadphises II is also said to have tried to accomplish this feat without success and consequently had to pay tribute to China.  Kaniska not only freed his kingdom from this obligation, but also took away hostages from a dependency of China.  Some scholars are of opinion that on a previous occasion Kaniska, too, tasted defeat at the hands of the Chinese general Pan-chao.[/p][p][![if !supportFootnotes]][![endif]][/p][p]Kaniska treated his hostages with utmost consideration, providing them with places of residence suitable for each season.  These hostages are said to have resided in the Sha lo ka monastery probably situated in the hills of Kapisa (modern Kafiristan) and in monasteries at Gandhāra and Eastern Punjab (Cinabhukti).[/p][p]Buddhist tradition describes Kaniska as a great patron of Buddhism comparable to Asoka: Legends about his conversion closely resemble those of Asoka, and it is probable that these legends were based on stories detailing Asoka's conversion.  Tradition represents Kaniska, before his conversion to Buddhism, as one who had no faith either in right or wrong and as a person who did not pay any attention to Buddhism.  It is also said that the immediate cause of his conversion was the deep remorse he felt over the bloodshed in his numerous wars. Though this tradition is based on facts it could be surmised that it was built up by the Buddhists making Kaniska to emulate Asoka and show the ennobling influence of Buddhism on him.[/p][p][/p][p]Epigraphical and numismatic records do not provide clear testimony regarding his conversion and religion.  Vincent Smith surmises that his coins show that his conversion to Buddhism did not take place until he had been on the throne for some time.  The finest and presumably the earliest coins bear legends, Greek in both script and language, with images of the sun and moon under the names Helios and Selene (spelt Saléné on the coins).  On later issues, the Greek script is retained but the language is Knotanese, while the reverse of the coins represents gods worshipped by Greeks, Persians and Indians. The coins that bear the images of Sākyamuni are considered to be the latest.  Some Indian scholars think that if numismatic evidence proves anything, it is only his eclecticism, or that his coins only depict the various forms of faith prevailing in his vast empire. Despite attempts to adduce evidence to prove that he was not a Buddhist, the testimony provided by the numerous monuments he has built, as well as his association with the Buddhist Council held during his reign show that, even if he was not a Buddhist, he was more bent towards Buddhism than towards any other religion.  An inscription found on a relic casket, too, is taken by some scholars as evidence to establish that he favoured the Sarvāstivāda school of Buddhism.[/p][p]Tradition records that Kaniska studied Buddhism in his leisure hours under the guidance of Pārsva.  Tradition also states that he carried off Asvaghosa from Pātaliputra. Even if this story is not accepted it is plausible to hold that Kaniska and Asvaghosa were contemporaries and that these two were associates.[/p][p][/p][p]Two eminent Buddhist scholars Vasumitra and Nāgārjuna too, are said to be his contemporaries. Buddhism at that time was a force to reckon with, and despite the possibility that Kaniska was doing his best to consolidate big vast empire; he adopted Buddhism to keep abreast of the trends prevalent at the time.[/p][p][/p][p]According to the Buddhist tradition the greatest service rendered to Buddhism by Kaniska is his convening of the Buddhist Council during his reign.  There are different accounts of this council.  The best known is that of  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/h/hiuen_tsang,Hsuan-tsang')"]Hsuan-tsang[/a].Paramārtha in his Life of Vasubandhu gives another version which, though generally considered to be the same as that of Hsuan-tsang, contains different information.Tārānātha also records an account, which, though confused, contains important information.  It is not relevant at present, to extract facts from these legendary accounts which are confused and often discrepant.[/p][p][/p][p]It is said that Kaniska, greatly puzzled by the conflicting teachings found in different schools, suggested to Pārsva to summon a council of eminent monks to obtain an authoritative disposition of the doctrine.  There was some difference of opinion among them as to the venue of the council and they finally decided to hold it at the Kundalavana vihāra in Kashmir.Vasumitra was elected president with Asvaghosa as the Vice president.  The members, five hundred in all composed 100,000 stanzas of Upadesa Sāstra explanatory of the canonical sutras, 100,000 stanzas of Vinaya vibhāsā sastra explanatory of the vinaya and 100,000 of Abhidharmavibhāsā sastra explanatory of the Abhidharma.  Kaniska is said to have caused these treatises to be written on copper plates and enclosed them in stone boxes which he deposited in a stūpa specially constructed for that purpose.[/p][p][/p][p]It is not possible to form a clear idea about the work accomplished at the Council.  Some scholars think that the chief business of the Council was to collect canonical texts, and to prepare commentaries of different schools of Buddhism.[/p][p][/p][p]Tradition seems to connect the rise of Māhānānana with Kaniska and with the Buddhist Council held during his reign. The fact that this Council is recognised by the Mahānānists is also taken as evidence on this point.  But a close scrutiny of the available information regarding the Council as well as the Buddhist activities carried out by Kaniska shows that this tradition cannot be relied upon.  It is a fact that Tārānātha observes that all kinds ofMahāyānist writing appeared at this time and that the Theravādins raised no objection.  But he neither clearly states nor implies that Kaniska personally took any interest in promoting Mahāyāna teachings, or that any Mahāyāna treatises were composed at that Council.  On the other hand, it is generally regarded that this Council was exclusively a council of the Sarvāstivādins of northern India and that the Mahāyānists did not take part in it. It is apparent that after holding this Council the Sarvāstivādin school of Buddhism gained more importance than before.[/p][p][/p][p]Whatever the tradition is there is no reasonable ground to hold that Kaniska was responsible for the rise and rapid spread of Mahāyānism and that the Council held during his reign was a Mahāyāna Buddhist Council.  It is plausible to hold that he was more bent towards Sarvāstivāda teachings and this is established by the inscription on the relic casket.[/p][p][/p][p]Of the numerous stūpas he is said to have built, the most famous is the one at Shah-ji-ki-Dheri near Peshawar.  From the accounts of the Chinese travellers of the fifth and seventh centuries it appears that it was one of the wonders at the time.  This stūpa is said to have been 130 metres in height, resting upon a stone substructure 50 metres high, topped by an iron mast 10 metres high with gilded metal discs.  It is assumed that the original form of the stūpa as it appeared in the days of Kaniska, looked quite different from the form that could be reconstructed from the ruins.  It is also believed that it was rebuilt many times.[/p][p][/p][p]The reliquary enshrined in the Kaniska cetiya is also worthy of note.  The object is a round pyxis, made of an amalgum of precious metals.  The lower hand of the drum consists of representation in relief of garland bearing erotes and Kusāna sovereign, identified by scholars as Kaniska, between the divinities of the sun and moon; on the side of the lid is a flock of geese (hamsa).  To the top of the cover are fastened free standing statuettes of the Buddha, flanked by Indra and Brahmā.  The most interesting feature of the object is the Greek name of the maker, agesilas, the overseer of works at the Kaniska-caitya.  The inscription found on the reliquary also states that it was made "for acceptance of the teachers of the Sarvāstivādin school" and this is cited as evidence to prove that Kaniska was an adherent of this school of Buddhism.[/p][p][/p][p]During Kaniska's reign his empire was enriched through trade carried on with countries outside India, especially with Rome and Asia Minor, and as such he had the necessary resources to patronise the arts.  Many scholars believe that Gandhāra art attained its peak during his reign. Tradition which credits Kaniska with having built many stūpas, also seems to support this contention.  According to Benjamin Rowland "The Art of Gandhāra is, properly speaking; the official art of the Kushān emperor Kaniska and his successors (see also, GANDHĀRA).[/p][p][/p][p]Like Asoka, Kaniska also helped missionary activities.  It was during his reign that Buddhism spread and became firmly established in central and eastern Asia.  There are no records of any missionaries sent by him.  But it is accepted that under his patronage Buddhism greatly flourished and spread throughout his vast empire.  One writer has observed that "there was ceaseless missionary activity throughout his vast empire which extended from Madhyadesa in India to Central Asia.  A truly integrated Asian culture came into existence at this time..," Vincent Smith observes that the legend regarding his death possibly may be founded on fact.[/p][p][/p][p]A statue of Kaniska was discovered by Tokritila, in the village of Māt.  In this headless statue the king is represented with his right hand resting on a mace and the left clamping the hilt of the sword.  He is dressed in a tunic reaching down to the knees, and held round the loins by a girdle.  He wears heavy boots with straps round the ankles.  Though headless, an inscription found on it proves conclusively that it represents Kaniska.[/p][p][/p][hr][p][/p][p]BIBLIOGRAPHY[/p][p]Bapat, P.V.

Elsewhere (Vin.i.85), Kantaka is mentioned as being expelled from the Order for having had sexual intercourse with a nun, Kantakā by name.  According to the Pacittiya (Vin.iv.138f), Kantaka held the same false views as Arittha (q.v.), and for that reason he was expelled from the Sangha.  The Chabbaggiya monks, however, received him into their ranks and gave him every encouragement.  In the Samantapāsadikā (iv.874) Kantakasāmanera is mentioned with Arittha and the Vajjiputtakas, as having been an enemy of the Buddha's religion.[/p][hr]</entry>

  <entry>[div class="huge"]Kañcanaguhā[/div][p]A cave in the region of the Himālaya, according to one description (J.ii.176; but see J.v.357, where it is said to be near Cittakūta) in the face of the Cittakūapabbata.  This cave was the abode of the Bodhisatta when he was born as a lion, as described in the Virocana Jātaka (J.i.491f), and again in the Sigāla Jātaka (J.ii.6).  Near by was the Rajatapabbata.  This cave was also the dwelling-place of the geese mentioned in the Kacchapa Jātaka (J.ii.176), and in the cave grew the Abbhanta-ramba (J.ii.396), the property of Vessavana.  In the scholiast to the Hatthipāla Jātaka (J.iv.484), the Kañcanagūha is mentioned as the abode of the spider Unnābhi and the ninety-six thousand geese who took shelter in it, waiting for the rains to clear.  Near the cave was the Chaddantadaha and the Buddha, when he was born as the elephant Chaddanta, made the cave his headquarters (J.v.37f).  In this context the cave is described as being in the Suvannapabbata (probably another name for Kañcanapabbata) to the west of the Chaddanta lake, and is said to be twelve leagues in extent.  There lived the elephant king with eight thousand companions.  Nandatāpasa once lived for seven days at the entrance to the cave, going to Uttarakuru for his food (J.v.316, 392).[/p][p][/p][p]The Pākahamsas of great power also lived in the cave (J.v.357, 368), once as many in number as ninety thousand (J.v.381).[/p][p]In the Sudhābhojana Jātaka (J.v.392), the cave is stated to have been on the top of Manosilātala.[/p][p]The Kañcanagūha is mentioned in literature as the dwelling-place of maned lions (kesarasīhā) (E.g., UdA.71, 105).[/p][hr]</entry>
  <entry>[div class="huge"]Kañcanakkhandha Jātaka (No.  56)[/div][p]The Bodhisatta was once born as a farmer and, while ploughing his field, came upon a nugget of gold, four cubits long and as thick as a man's thigh, which had been buried by a merchant in bygone days.  Finding it impossible to remove the gold as a whole, he cut it into four and carried it home easily.  The story was related in reference to a monk who wished to leave the Order because he was frightened by all the rules his teachers asked him to learn and obey.  The Buddha gave him three rules - to guard voice, body and mind - and the monk won arahantship.  Even a heavy burden becomes light if carried piece by piece.  J.i.276-8.[/p][hr]</entry>
  <entry>[div class="huge"]Kankhāvitaranī[/div][p]A commentary, also called Mātikatthakathā, by Buddhaghosa on the Pātimokkha of the Vinaya Pitaka.  The colophon also contains a summary, a kind of uddāna, of the contents.  It is stated that the work was written at the request of a thera named Sona, and Buddhaghosa declares most emphatically that there is not even a single word in the book which is not in conformity with the Canon or the Commentaries of the Mahāvihāra (p.204, ed.  Hewavitarane Bequest Series; Gv.59, 69.).  The Gandhavamsa (61f, 71; also Svd.1212) mentions a tīkā on the Kankhāvitaranī named Vinayatthamañjūsā, written by Buddhanāga at the request of Sumedha.[/p][hr]</entry>
  <entry>[div class="huge"]Katāhaka Jātaka (No.125)[/div][p]Once when the Bodhisatta was a rich treasurer in Benares a son was born to him.  A female slave in the house gave birth to a son on the same day.  The boys grew up together, the slave's son being called Katāhaka.  Katāhaka acquired various arts in the company of his master.  When he grew up he was appointed as the Treasurer's private secretary.  One day he visited a merchant on the frontier, carrying a letter purporting to be from the Treasurer (in which he was stated to be the son of the latter), asking for the hand of the merchant's daughter in marriage.  The merchant was overjoyed, and the marriage took place.  Katāhaka gave himself great airs and spoke contemptuously of everything "provincial." The Treasurer, discovering what had happened, decided to visit the merchant, but Katāhaka went to meet him on the way, and paying him all the honour due from a slave, begged him not to expose him.  Meanwhile, he had misled his wife's relations into the belief that the homage, paid by him to the Treasurer, was but the regard due from a son to his father.  He was not like the sons of other parents, but knew what was due to his father.  The Bodhisatta, being pleased, did not expose the slave, but on learning from Katāhaka's wife that Katāhaka always complained of his food, he taught her a stanza which contained the threat - not intelligible to her, though clear to Katāhaka - that if Katāhaka continued to make a nuisance of himself, the Treasurer would return and expose him.  Thenceforth Katāhaka held his peace.[/p][p]The story was related in reference to a monk who used to boast of his high lineage and the wealth of his family until his pretensions were exposed (J.i.451ff).[/p][p]According to the Dhammapada Commentary (DhA.iii.357ff), the story was told in reference to a monk named Tissa who would complain, no matter what attentions were paid to him.[/p][hr]</entry>
  <entry>[div class="huge"]Katuviya Sutta[/div][p]Once when the Buddha was going about for alms near the fig-tree at the cattle tethering in the neighbourhood of Isipatana, he saw a monk, whose delight was in the empty outer joys of sense, and admonished him, saying that flies will settle on and attack him who is corrupt and reeks with the stench of carrion.  Hearing this, the monk was greatly stirred.  Later the Buddha repeated the admonition to the assembled monks and explained that greed was corruption, malice the stench of carrion and evil ways of thought the flies.  A.i.280f.[/p][hr]</entry>
  <entry>[div class="huge"]Kandina Jātaka (No.13)[/div][p]A mountain stag fell in love with a doe who had gone into the forest from the village during the time of the ripening of the corn.  When the time came for the doe to return to the village, the stag, in his love, accompanied her.  The people of the village, knowing of the deer's return, lay in ambush for them.  The doe, seeing a huntsman, sent the stag on ahead, and he was killed and eaten.  The doe escaped.  The Bodhisatta, who was a forest-deva, seeing the incident, preached to the other forest-dwellers on the three infamies: [/p][ul][li][p]it is infamy to cause another's death; [/li][li][p]infamous is the land ruled by a woman: [/li][li][p]infamous are the men who yield themselves to women's dominance (J.i.153-6).[/li][/ul][p]The circumstances in which the story was related are given in the Indriya Jātaka.[/p][hr]</entry>
  <entry>[div class="huge"]Kajangala (Kajangalā)[/div][p]A township which formed the eastern boundary of the Majjhimadesa.  Beyond it was Mahāsālā (Vin.i.197; DA.i.173; MA.i.316, etc.; AA.i.55, etc.; J.i.49; Mbv.12).  In the Buddha's time it was a prosperous place where provisions could easily be obtained (dabbasambhārasulabhā) (J.iv.310).  Once when the Buddha was staying in the Veluvana at Kajangala, the lay followers there heard a sermon from the Buddha and went to the nun Kajangalā to have it explained in detail (A.v.54f).  On another occasion the Buddha stayed in the Mukheluvana and was visited there by Uttara, the disciple of Pārāsariya.  Their conversation is recorded in the Indriyabhāvānā Sutta (M.iii.298ff).  In the Milindapañha (p.10), Kajangala is described as a brahmin village and is given as the place of Nāgasena's birth.  In the Kapota Jātaka mention is made of Kajangala, and the scholiast (J.iii.226-7) explains that it may be the same as Benares.  According to the scholiast of the Bhisa Jātaka (J.iv.311), the tree-spirit mentioned in that story was the chief resident monk in an old monastery in Kajangala, which monastery he repaired with difficulty during the time of Kassapa Buddha.[/p][p][/p][p]Kajangala is identified with the Kie-chu-hoh-khi-lo of Hiouen Thsang, which he describes as a district about two thousand li in circumference.  (Beal, Bud.  Records, ii.193, and n.; see also Cunningham, A.G.I.723).  It may also be identical with the town Pundavardhana mentioned in the Divyāvadāna (p.21f).  The Avadānasataka (ii.41) calls it Kacangalā.[/p][hr]</entry>

When his friend Sāmaññakāni joined the Order, he followed his example and exerted himself in meditation, sleeping but little.  One night, overcome by sleep, he fell on the terrace where he was pacing to and fro, and the Buddha, seeing him, went himself to help him and urged him not to give up his efforts but to concentrate and contemplate.  Aided by this admonition, Kātiyāna soon became an arahant.  The Buddha's sermon is included in the Theragāthā (Thag.vv.411-16; ThagA.i.450f).[/p][p]From the story of Sāmaññakāni, given in the Theragāthā Commentary (i, p.99f), it would appear that Kātiyāna was, for some time, a Paribbājaka.  He was destitute, having, since the appearance of the Buddha, lost all his support from the laity.  He therefore sought Sāmaññakāni and asked his advice, which he followed by joining the Order.[/p][p][/p][p]4. Kātiyāna.-See Pakudha.[/p][hr]</entry>

Later, his sister Nandā persuaded him to transfer his patronage to the orthodox monks, and a convocation was held, with his support, at the Vālikārāma in Vesāli, at which the Vajjians were proved in the wrong.

Some hold that he is the same as Kākavanna of the Purānas and Udāyin of the Jaina traditions, and that these names are merely other appellations of Udayabhadda of the Pali sources.  Kālāsoka is credited with having removed the capital of Magadha from Rājagaha to Pātaliputta.

The Kālāmas were Khattiyas (AA.i.418).

  <entry>[div class="huge"]Kanhadīpāyana[/div][hr][p]1. Kanhadīpāyana.-An ascetic of great power.  When the Andhakavenhudāsaputtā found themselves unable to capture Dvāravatī, because the city rose into the air when attacked, they sought the ascetic's help.  He told them that an ass wandered round the city and brayed at the sight of an enemy, when the city immediately rose up into the sky.  The Andhakavenhus sought the ass and begged for his help.  Acting on the ass's advice, they tied eight great iron posts to the gates, thus preventing the city from rising.  In this way they captured it (J.iv.83).[/p][p]Later, their sons, wishing to test Kanhadipānyana's powers of clairvoyance, played a practical joke on him.  They tied a pillow to the belly of a young lad, and dressing him up as a woman, took him to the ascetic and asked when the baby would be born.  The ascetic replied that on the seventh day the person before him would give birth to a knot of acacia wood which would destroy the race of Vāsudeva.  The youths thereupon fell on him and killed him, but his prophecy came true (J.iv.87).  This ascetic is evidently not the one mentioned in the Jātaka bearing his name, for there he is identified with the Bodhisatta, while in the story given above the Bodhisatta was the ascetic's contemporary and was called Ghatapandita (q.v.).[/p][p]The immolation of Kanhadīpāyana and its consequences are often referred to.

  <entry>[div class="huge"]Kanhā[/div][hr][p]1. Kanhā.-Daughter of the king of Kosala.  Before she was born, Brahmadatta, king of Benares, killed her father and carried off her mother.  When the child was born, Brahmadatta adopted her as his own daughter; she is, therefore, called dvepitikā (=having two fathers).  The king promised to grant her a boon, and she held a svayamvara, at which she chose as her husbands all the five sons of King Pandu; Ajjuna, Bhīma, Nakula, Yuddhitthila, and Sahadeva.  According to the Mahābhārata, Draupadī, daughter of the Pañcāla king, was the wife of these five princes.[/p][p]By her strong passions she won the love of them all.  Not satisfied with them, she also made love to a hump-backed slave who was in her service.  One day, when she was sick, all her husbands were gathered round her, and she made signs to each of them to show that she loved him best.  Ajjuna, however, was suspicious, and by questioning the hump-back, learnt the truth.  The five brothers left her and retired to the Himalaya, where they became ascetics.  The story was related by Kunāla, who is identified with Ajjuna.  J.v.424, 426f.[/p][p][/p][p]2. Kanhā.-See Kanhājinā.[/p][hr]</entry>

His attempts failed, and Vidhura, learning the motive for his act, preached to him, seated on the top of the mountain, and converted him (J.vi.255, 264, 302ff, 309, 326).

  <entry>[div class="huge"]Kapilavatthu[/div][p]A city near the Himalaya, capital of the Sākiyans (q.v.).  It was founded by the sons of Okkāka, on the site of the hermitage of the sage Kapila - see Kapila (3) (J.i.15, 49, 50, 54, 64, etc.; see also Divy 548, and Buddhacarita I.v.2).  Near the city was the Lumbinīvana (q.v.) where the Buddha was born, and which became one of the four places of pilgrimage for the Buddhists.  Close to Kapilavatthu flowed the river Rohinī, which formed the boundary between the kingdoms of the Sākyans and the Koliyans (DhA.iii.254).  In the sixth century B.C.  Kapilavatthu was the centre of a republic, at the head of which was Suddhodana.  The administration and judicial business of the city and all other matters of importance were discussed and decided in the Santhāgārasālā (D.i.91; J.iv.145).  It was here that Vidūdabha was received by the Sākyans (J.iv.146f).  The walls of the city were eighteen cubits high (J.i.63; according to Mtu.ii.75 it had seven walls).  From Kapilavatthu to the river Anomā, along the road taken by Gotama, when he left his home, was a distance of thirty yojanas (J.i.64).  The city was sixty leagues from Rājagaha, and the Buddha took two months covering this distance when he visited his ancestral home, in the first year after his Enlightenment.  On this journey the Buddha was accompanied by twenty thousand monks, and Kāludāyī went on ahead as harbinger.  The Buddha and his company lived in the Nigrodhārāma near the city and, in the midst of his kinsmen, as he did at the foot of the Gandamba, the Buddha performed the Yamakapātihāriya to convince them of his powers.  (J.i.87ff; this journey to Kapilavatthu was one of the scenes depicted in the relic-chamber of the Mahā-Thūpa, Mhv.xxx.81).[/p][p]On this occasion he preached the Vessantara Jātaka.  The next day the Buddha went begging in the city to the great horror of his father, who, on being explained that such was the custom of all Buddhas, became a sotāpanna and invited the Buddha and his monks to the palace.  After the meal the Buddha preached to the women of the palace who, with the exception of Rāhulamātā, had all come to hear him.  At the end of the sermon, Suddhodana became a sakadāgāmī and Mahā-Pajāpatī a sotāpanna.  The Buddha visited Rāhulamātā in her dwelling and preached to her the Candakinnara Jātaka.  The next day Nanda was ordained, and seven days later Rāhula (also Vin.i.82).  As a result of the latter's ordination, a rule was passed by the Buddha, at Suddhodana's request, that no one should be ordained without the sanction of his parents, if they were alive.  On the eighth day was preached the Mahādhammapāla Jātaka, and the king became an anāgāmī.  The Buddha returned soon after to Rājagaha, stopping on the way at Anupiyā, where the conversions of Ananda, Devadatta, Bhagu, Anuruddha, and Kimbila took place.  [/p][p]During the visit to Kapilavatthu, eighty thousand Sākyans from eighty thousand families had joined the Buddhist Order (Vin.ii.180; DhA.i.112; iv.124, etc.).  According to the Buddhavamsa Commentary (BuA.4; Bu.  p.5f), it was during this visit that, at the request of Sāriputta, the Buddha preached the Buddhavamsa.  It is not possible to ascertain how many visits in all were paid by the Buddha to his native city, but it may be gathered from various references that he went there several times; two visits, in addition to the first already mentioned, were considered particularly memorable.  On one of these he arrived in Kapilavatthu to prevent the Sākyans and the Koliyans, both his kinsmen, from fighting each other over the question of their sharing the water of the Rohinī; he appeared before them as they were preparing to slay each other, and convinced them of the futility of their wrath.  On this occasion were preached the following Jātakas: the Phandana, the Daddabha, the Latukika, the Rukkhadhamma, and the Vattaka - also the Attadanda Sutta.  Delighted by the intervention of the Buddha, the two tribes each gave him two hundred and fifty youths to enter his Order and, with these, he went on his alms rounds alternately to Kapilavatthu and to the capital of the Koliyans (J.v.412ff; the Sammodamāna Jātaka also seems to have been preached in reference to this quarrel, J.i.208).  On this occasion he seems to have resided, not at the Nigrodhārāma, but in the Mahāvana.[/p][p]The second visit of note was that paid by the Buddha when Vidūdabha (q.v), chagrined by the insult of the Sākyans, invaded Kapilavatthu in order to take his revenge.  Three times Vidūdabha came with his forces, and three times he found the Buddha seated on the outskirts of Kapilavatthu, under a tree which gave him scarcely any shade; near by was a shady banyan-tree, in Vidūdabha's realm; on being invited by Vidūdabha to partake of its shade, the Buddha replied, "Let be, O king; the shade of my kindred keeps me cool." Thus three times Vidūdabha had to retire, his purpose unaccomplished; but the fourth time the Buddha, seeing the fate of the Sākyans, did not interfere (J.iv.152).[/p][p]The Buddha certainly paid other visits besides these to Kapilavatthu.  On one such visit he preached the Kanha Jātaka (J.iv.6ff).  Various Sākyans went to see him both at the Nigrodhārāma and at the Mahāvana, among them being Mahānāma (S.v.369f; A.iii.284f; iv.220f; v.320f), Nandiya (S.v.403f; 397f; A.v.334f), Vappa (A.ii.196; M.i.91), and perhaps Sārakāni (S.v.372).[/p][p]During one visit the Buddha was entrusted with the consecration of a new mote-hall, built by the Sākyans; he preached far into the night in the new building, and, when weary, asked Moggallāna to carry on while he slept.  We are told that the Sākyans decorated the town with lights for a yojana round, and stopped all noise while the Buddha was in the mote-hall (MA.ii.575).  On this occasion was preached the Sekha Sutta (M.i.353ff).[/p][p]The books record a visit paid by the Brahmā Sahampati to the Buddha in the Mahāvana at Kapilavatthu.  (This appears, from the context, to have been quite close to the Nigrodhārāma.)[/p][p]The Buddha, worried by the noisy behavior of some monks who had recently been admitted into the Order, was wondering how he could impress on them the nature of their calling.  Sahampati visited him and, being thus encouraged, the Buddha returned to Nigrodhārāma and there performed a miracle before the monks; seeing them impressed, he talked to them on the holy life (S.iii.91f; Ud.25).[/p][p]A curious incident is related in connection with a visit paid by the Buddha to Kapilavatthu, when he went there after his rounds among the Kosalans.  Mahānāma was asked to find a place of lodging for the night; he searched all through the town without success, and at length the Buddha was compelled to spend the night in the hermitage of Bharandu, the Kālāman (A.i.276f).  On another occasion we hear of the Buddha convalescing at Kapilavatthu after an illness (A.i.219).[/p][p]Not all the Sākyans of Kapilavatthu believed in their kinsman's great powers, even after the Buddha's performance of various miracles.  We find, for instance, Dandapānī meeting the Buddha in the Mahāvana and, leaning on his staff, questioning him as to his tenets and his gospel.  We are told that in answer to the Buddha's explanations, Dandapānī shook his head, waggled his tongue, and went away, still leaning on his staff, his brow puckered into three wrinkles (M.i.108f.; this was the occasion for the preaching of the Madhupindika Sutta).  [/p][p]Others were more convinced and patronised the Order - e.g., Kāla-Khemaka and Ghatāya, who built cells for monks in the Nigrodhārāma (M.iii.109. As a result of noticing these cells, the Buddha preached the Mahasuññāta Sutta).[/p][p]It is said that the Buddha ordained ten thousand householders of Kapilavatthu with the "ehi-bhikkhu-pabbajā." (Sp.i.241)[/p][p]Mahānāma (q.v.) was the Buddha's most frequent visitor; to him was preached the Cūladukkhakkhandha Sutta (M.i.91f).[/p][p]The Dakkhinā-vibhanga Sutta was preached as the result of a visit to the Buddha by Mahā-Pajāpatī-Gotamī.  Apart from those already mentioned, another Sākyan lady lived in Kapilavatthu, Kāligodhā by name, and she was the only kinsman, with the exception of the Buddha's father and wife, to be specially visited by the Buddha (S.v.396).[/p][p]The inhabitants of Kapilavatthu are called Kapilavatthavā (E.g., S.iv.182).[/p][p]From Kapilavatthu lay a direct road to Vesālī (Vin.ii.253), and through Kapilavatthu passed the road taken by Bāvarī's disciples from Alaka to Sāvatthi (Sn.p.194).[/p][p]From the Mahāvana, outside Kapilavatthu, the forest extended up to the Himalaya, and on the other side of the city it reached as far as the sea (MA.i.449, UdA.184; Sp.ii.393).[/p][p]It is significant that, in spite of the accounts given of the greatness of Kapilavatthu, it was not mentioned by Ananda among the great cities, in one of which, in his opinion, the Buddha could more fittingly have died than in Kusinārā (D.ii.146).  After the Buddha's death, a portion of the relics was claimed by the Sākyans of Kapilavatthu, and a shrine to hold them was erected in the city (D.ii.167; Bu.xxviii.2).  Here was deposited the rug (paccattharana) used by the Buddha (Bu.xxviii.8).[/p][p]In the northern books the city was called Kapilavastu, Kapilapura, and Kapilāvhayapura (E.g.  Lal.  p.243, 28; The Buddha-carita, I.v.2 calls it Kapilasyavastu).  According to the Dulva (Rockhill, p.11), the city was on the banks of the Bhagīrathī.[/p][p]The identification of Kapilavatthu is not yet beyond the realm of conjecture.  Hiouen Thsang (Beal ii.,p.13f) visited the city and found it like a wilderness.  The Asoka inscriptions of the Lumbinī pillar and the Niglīva pillar are helpful in determining the site.  Some identify the modern village of Piprāwā - famous for the vases found there - with Kapilavatthu (E.g., Fleet, J.R.A.S.1906, p.180; CAGI.711f).  Others, including Rhys Davids, say there were two cities, one ancient and the other modern, founded after Vidūdabha's conquest, and the ancient one they call Tilaura Kot.  But the theory of two Kapilavatthu is rejected by some scholars.  J.R.A.S.1906, pp.453, 563. See also the article by Mukherji on Kapilavastu in ERE.[/p][hr]</entry>

He visited the Buddha at the Añjanavana in Sāketa, and asked him whether he experienced feelings of pleasure and sorrow.  The Buddha replied that he had overcome such feelings and was utterly free, whereupon Kakudha uttered his praises (S.i.54f).  The Commentary (SA.i.89) says that this Kakudha was a Brahma and that he was an attendant of Moggallāna, thus identifying him with Kakudha (3 below).  He lived with the thera in his youth, died in a Jhāna-trance and was reborn in the Brahma-world.[/p][p][/p][p]3. Kakudha.-Probably identical with Kakudha (2).

Becoming aware of Devadatta's plans for obtaining possession of the leadership of the Sangha, Kakudha reported the news to Moggallāna, who passed it on to the Buddha.  The Buddha asked Moggallāna to keep the matter secret.  Moggallāna informed the Buddha that he knew from experience that Kakudha's predictions proved true (Vin.ii.185f).[/p][p][/p][p]4.

In the evening, having searched for his food in the pigeon's company, he accompanied him home, and the setthi's cook, on seeing him, provided a basket for him.  One day, seeing some fish being prepared, the crow feigned illness and stayed behind in his basket, in spite of the warnings of the pigeon, who suspected his real reason.  The cook caught the crow stealing a piece of fish and, in order to punish him, plucked his feathers and soused him in a pickle of ginger and salt and cumin mixed with sour butter-milk.

(See also PHAI., p.93. The Jātakas mention the countries separately as comprising two kingdoms ruled by a single king, e.g., J.iii.364, 378).  At the end of the Third Council, Moggaliputta sent the thera Majjhantika to propagate the religion in Kasmīra-Gandhāra.  Majjhantika quelled the power of the Nāga-king Aravāla (q.v.), who was a menace to the inhabitants, and converted him to the faith, while the yakkha Pandaka and his wife Hāritā, with their five hundred sons, became sotāpannas.  The thera preached the Āsīvisūpama Sutta to the assembled multitude and won eighty thousand converts, while one hundred thousand persons entered the Order.

  <entry>[div class="huge"]Kāludāyī Thera[/div][p]Son of one of Suddhodana's ministers at Kapilavatthu; he was born on the same day as the Buddha and grew up as his playfellow.  After Gotama left the world, Suddhodana made Kāludāyī one of his most trusted counsellors.  When the king heard of his son's Enlightenment he sent several of his ministers with large retinues to bring the Buddha to Kapilavatthu, but they all became arahants as soon as they heard the Buddha's preaching and then forgot their mission.  In the end the king sent Kāludāyī, on the understanding that he should first be allowed to join the Order.  (According to Mtu.iii.233, he was accompanied by Channa in this mission).  He went to the Buddha and, having listened to him, himself became an arahant.  When the rains fell, covering the earth with the glory of leaves and flowers, Kāludāyī felt that it was time for the Buddha to visit his kinsmen, and gave him their invitation, singing the season's beauties in a series of verses.  The Buddha took sixty days in covering the sixty leagues from Rājagaha to Kapilavatthu, and each day Kāludāyī went by air to the king's palace to tell him of the progress made in the journey and to bring back to the Buddha from the palace a bowl full of excellent food.  By the time the Buddha reached his home his kinsmen were already full of faith in him.  Because Kāludāyī accomplished this feat, he was declared pre-eminent among those who gladdened the clans (kulappasādakānam aggo) (A.i.25; Thag.527-36; J.i.54, 86f; AA.i.107, 117; ThagA.i.497ff; UdA.168; DA.ii.425).[/p][p]It is said that he was called Udāyī because he was born on a day on which the citizens were full of joy (udaggacittadivase jātattā); and called Kāla because of his slightly dark colour.  AA.i.167; ThagA.i.498.[/p][p]According to the Apadāna (ii.500f; see also Ap.i.86f, where another set of verses is attributed to Kāludāyī), Kāludāyī had been the son of a minister of Hamsavatī during the time of Padumuttara Buddha, and having heard the Buddha utter the praises of a monk skilled in converting families, had wished for the same eminence.[/p][p]The Anguttara Nikāya (A.iv.449f) records a conversation between Udāyī (who, according to Buddhaghosa (AA.ii.815), is to be identified with Kāludāyī) and Ananda.  Udāyī asks Ananda to explain in detail a question which is recorded in the Samyutta Nikāya (S.i.48) as having been asked of the Buddha by Pañcālacanda-devaputta (see Pañcāla Sutta).[/p][p]The Dhammapada Commentary (iv.143) refers to an assembly at which Kāludāyī was present, his body of golden hue, sitting near Pasenadi, at sunset, with the moon rising in the eastern sky.  Ananda looks at them and declares how the Buddha suffuses them all with his glory.[/p][p]Kāludāyī is identified with Sakka in the Bhisa Jātaka (J.iv.314).[/p][hr]</entry>

The Bodhisatta went on ahead to prepare the hermitage, leaving the father and the younger brother to follow.  The lad, finding the father's progress very slow, tried to hurry him, much to the latter's annoyance.  The two quarrelled, and thus were so late that the Bodhisatta came to look for them.  On hearing what had happened, he told the father, who is called Kassapa, that the old should have patience with the young.[/p][p]The story was told in reference to a nobleman of Sāvatthi, who became a monk and who, on his mother's death, was joined by his father and younger brother.  All three went to a village retreat to fetch robes, and things happened as in the past.

  <entry>[div class="huge"]Kānā[/div][p]Daughter of Kānamātā.  After she married she visited her mother, and one day, while she was there, her husband sent for her.  Her mother, not wishing her to return empty-handed, asked her to wait till she had made some cakes.  When the cakes were ready, a monk came to the door and Kānā gave him some.  Four other monks came, and the cakes were finished.  Four times Kānā's husband sent for her and four times the same thing happened.  So, in anger, the husband took another wife.  Kānā, learning this, was so greatly annoyed that she reviled and abused every monk she saw until no monk dared go into her street.  The Buddha, hearing of this, visited Kānā's mother, and having finished his meal there, sent for Kānā, argued with her, and convinced her that the monks were not to blame inasmuch as they had only taken what was given them.  At the end of the Buddha's discourse Kānā became a sotāpanna.  The king saw the Buddha returning from Kānā's home and, on learning what had happened, sent for her, adopted her as his daughter, and arranged for her marriage with a rich nobleman.  Thenceforward Kānā's generosity to the monks became proverbial.

They paid periodical visits to the Himalaya forests, felled trees, and having prepared the timber which was suitable for building purposes, brought it down the Ganges and erected houses for the king and for the people.  [/p][p]Growing tired of this work, these carpenters made flying machines of light wood, and going northwards from Benares to Himavā, established by conquest a kingdom, the chief carpenter becoming the king.  He came to be called Katthavāhana, the capital was named Katthavāhananagara and the country Katthavāhanarattha.  The king was righteous and the people very happy and the country prospered greatly.  Later Katthavāhana and the king of Benares became sincere friends, and free trade, exempt from all taxes, was established between the two countries.  The kings sent each other very costly and magnificent gifts.  [/p][p]Once Katthavāhana sent to the king of Benares eight priceless rugs in eight caskets of lacquered ivory, each rug being sixteen cubits long and eight cubits wide and of unsurpassed splendour.  The Benares king, wondering how he could adequately return the courtesy, decided to let his friend learn the great news of the appearance in the world of the Buddha (Kassapa), the Dhamma and the Sangha.  This message was written on a gold leaf and the leaf enclosed in many caskets, one inside the other, the innermost casket being made of the seven kinds of jewels and the outermost of costly wood.  The caskets were placed on a splendid palanquin and sent on the back of a royal elephant, accompanied by all the insignia of royalty.  All along the route the honours due to a king were paid to the casket, and Katthavāhana himself escorted the elephant from the frontiers of his kingdom to the capital.  When Katthavāhana discovered the message, he was overjoyed, and sent his nephew with sixteen of his ministers and sixteen thousand followers to investigate the matter and convey his greetings to the Buddha.  [/p][p]The envoys arrived at Benares only after the Buddha's death, but hearing from the Buddha's disciples of the Doctrine he had proclaimed to the world, the ministers and their followers entered the Order, while Katthavāhana's nephew was sent back to report the news to the king, taking with him the Buddha's water-pot, a branch of the Bodhi tree and a monk versed in the Doctrine.

His wife would then be compelled to work for her living and her children would become slaves.[/p][p]The Jātakas (E.g., J.vi.208, 210; see also Manu.x.44) would lead us to believe that the people of Kamboja had lost their original customs and had become barbarous.  Elsewhere' Kamboja is mentioned as a place not visited by women of other countries.  A.ii.82; on the reading of this passage, however, see GS.ii.92, n.2. The Commentary (AA.ii.523) distinctly supports the reading Kamboja.[/p][p][/p][p]The country was evidently on one of the great caravan routes, and there was a road direct from Dvāraka to Kamboja (Pv.p.23).[/p][p][/p][p]According to Asoka's Rock Edict, No.  XIII.

The country referred to is probably on the banks of the Kabul river (Mookerji: Asoka, 168, n.1).[/p][p]In later literature (E.g., Cv.lxxvi.21, 55) Kamboja is the name given to Western Siam.

It would appear that Kassapa I.  founded a great monastic establishment out of the Vessagiri and Issarasamana Vihāras and that this enlarged monastery was named after his two daughters Bodhi and Uppalavannā and also after Kassapa himself.

  <entry>[div class="huge"]Kāka Jātaka (No.140, 146, 395)[/div][hr][p]1. Kāka Jātaka (No.140).-The Bodhisatta was once born as a crow.  One day a crow dropped filth on the king's chaplain as he was returning from the bath arrayed in all his splendour.  He thereupon conceived hatred against all crows.  Soon after that a woman slave, watching some rice spread out in the sun to dry, was angered by a goat who, as soon as she fell asleep, started to eat the rice.  In exasperation she fetched a torch and struck the goat's shaggy back, which caught fire.  To ease its pain, the goat ran into the hayshed near the king's elephant-stalls and rolled in the hay.  In the conflagration that ensued many of the elephants were badly burnt, and when the chaplain was consulted, remembering his anger against crows, he said that the cure for burns was crows' fat.  Crows were accordingly being mercilessly slaughtered; the Bodhisatta, hearing of this sought the king and explained to him the chaplain's motive.  Crows had no fat, he said, because their life is passed in ceaseless dread.  The king, being greatly pleased with the Bodhisatta's act, granted immunity to all living beings, showing particular favour towards crows.[/p][p]The circumstances which led to the recital of the story are described in the Bhaddasāla Jātaka (q.v.).  The king in the story was Ananda.[/p][hr][p]2. Kāka Jātaka (No.146).-Once a crow came with his mate to the seashore and ate freely of the remnants of a sacrifice which had been offered by men to the Nāgas and drank freely of the strong drink which he found.  Both crows became drunk, and, while trying to swim in the surf, the hen-crow was washed into the sea and eaten by a fish.  Hearing the husband's lamentations, many crows gathered together and started to empty the ocean, working away until ready to drop from weariness.  Seeing their plight, the Bodhisatta, who was then a sea-sprite, caused a bogey to appear from the sea, frightening them away.[/p][p]The story was told in reference to a number of monks who had joined the Order in their old age.  They went for alms to their former wives' and children's houses, and gathering together at the house of the wife of one of them (she being particularly beautiful), placed together what each had received and ate it with sauces and curries prepared by the beautiful wife.  The woman died, and the aged monks, returning to the monastery, wept aloud for their benefactress, the giver of sauces.  The matter was reported to the Buddha, who identified the crows of the past with the foolish monks (J.i.497-9).[/p][p]According to the Dhammapada Commentary (iii.422), the name of the woman was Madhurapācikā.[/p][hr][p]3. Kāka Jātaka (No.395).-The Bodhisatta was once a pigeon and lived in a net basket in the kitchen of a Benares merchant.  A greedy crow, becoming intimate with him, came to live there.  The cook discovered the crow trying to steal some food, and, pulling out his feathers, sprinkled him with flour, hung a chowrie round his neck and flung him into the basket.[/p][p]The story closely resembles those of the Kapota Jātaka and the Lola Jātaka (q.v.), and is related in reference to a greedy monk (J.iii.314-16; see also Cunningham: Bharhut Stūpa, xlv.  Pl.7).[/p][p]The Kapota Jātaka (J.i.241) makes reference to a Kaka Jātaka of the Navani-pāta.

A monkey came down from a tree hard by, filled his mouth and hands with peas, went back to his tree and started eating.  One pea fell down, and he, letting all the other peas fall, clambered down to seek for the lost one.  The Bodhisatta, who was the king's counsellor, pointed out to the king how fools of little wit spend a pound to win a penny.  On hearing this, the king went back to Benares.[/p][p]The story was told to Pasenadi, who was going on a similar expedition during the rains, and on the way visited the Buddha at Jetavana.

  <entry>[div class="huge"]Kaccāyana-vyākarana[/div][p]A treatise on Pāli grammar by Kaccāyana.  The treatise is in eight divisions, each division comprising suttas or rules, expressed with great brevity; vutti or supplements, to render the suttas intelligible; payoga or grammatical analyses, with examples, and nyāsa or scholia, explanatory notes of the principal grammatical forms in the shape of questions and answers.  The nyāsa often exists as a separate book, called the Mukhamattadīpanī.  Orthodox tradition ascribes the whole work to Mahā Kaccāna, but another tradition, recorded in the Kaccāyanabheda, states that the aphorisms are by Kaccāyana, the vutti by Sanghānandī, the illustrations by Brahmadatta and the nyāsa by Vimalabuddhi - all perhaps belonging to the same school of Avanti (see above, Kaccāna).[/p][p][/p][p]Kaccāyana's work shows clearly the influence of Sanskrit grammar, chiefly the Kātantra.  Many later works were written about the Kaccāyana (as it is called) or were based on it, the chief among them being the Rūpasiddhi, the Kaccāyanabheda, the Kaccāyanasāra and the Kaccāyanavannanā (q.v.).

  <entry>[div class="huge"]Kalyāna-dhamma Jātaka (No.171)[/div][p]The Bodhisatta was once a rich merchant in Benares.  One day, when he had gone to pay his respects to the king, his mother-in-law visited his wife.  The former was deaf, and on asking her daughter if they were happy, and receiving the reply that the husband was a very good man, like a hermit, she heard only the word "hermit," and she raised a great uproar thinking that her son-in-law had turned hermit.  The news spread like wildfire, and as the merchant was on his way home he was told by someone that all the members of his household were weeping because he had become a hermit.  Thinking that auspicious words should not be trifled with, the merchant went to the king, took his leave, and became an ascetic in the Himālaya.[/p][p][/p][p]The story was told in reference to a merchant of Sāvatthi to whom the same thing happened when he went to pay his respects to the Buddha (J.ii.63-5).

This was a strategic point in the wars with the Tamils, and we find Kākavannatissa entrusting its protection to his son Dīghābhaya (Mhv.xxiii.17).  It is probable that, some time afterwards, the place fell into the hands of the Tamils, for we find Dutthagāmanī mentioned as having captured it from the Tamil general Kapisīsa (Mhv.xxv.12).  According to the Mahāvamsa Tīkā (322, 366) the place was nine leagues from Anurādhapura, but Nimila journeyed there and back in one day.[/p][p]The Anguttara Commentary (i.367) mentions that a man named Mahāvācakāla was once born there as a crocodile, a fathom in length, for having cast doubts on the efficacy of the Buddha's religion.  Once he swallowed sixty carts with the bulls attached to them, the carts being filled with stone.[/p][p]The ford is now identified with Mahāgantota, the spot where the Ambanganga and the Mahaveliganga meet (Geiger, Mhv.Trs., 72, n.2).  The Ambanganga was probably called Kacchakanadī, and at the spot where it met the Mahaveliganga, King Subha built the Nandigāmaka-vihāra.

Returning home, the king noticed the state of the tree and compared it with another tree which, having no fruit, was spared such ravages.  Reflecting on this topic, he became a Pacceka Buddha and went to the Nandamūla-pabbhāra with three others - Naggaji, Nimi, and Dummukha.  The story of these four is given in the Kumbhakāra Jātaka.

On the river was a ford called Javamāla, crossed by Dutthagāmanī while fleeing from his brother Tissa (Mhv.xxiv.22).  According to this context, the river must have been in Rohana, and Geiger (Mhv.Trs.165, n.5) thinks that it is probably identical with the modern Kumbukkan-Oya.  The Mahāvamsa Tika (p.593) says that Malayamahādeva came to Kappakandara Piyangudīpa to receive alms from Dutthagāmanī.[/p][p][/p][p]According to the Rasavāhinī (Ras.ii.160) the village was near Cittalapabbata Vihāra.[/p][hr]</entry>
  <entry>[div class="huge"]Kānārittha[/div][p]One of the four sons of the Nāga-king Dhatarattha and his queen Samuddajā, the others being Sudassana, Bhūridatta and Subhaga.  When Kānārittha heard that his mother was a human, wishing to test her one day while drinking her milk, he assumed a serpent's form and struck her foot with his tail.  Samuddajā threw him on to the ground with a shriek and accidentally struck his eye with her nail, thereby blinding him.  Henceforth he, whose name had been Arittha, was known as Kānārittha (J.vi.168).  When, after Bhūridatta's disappearance (see Bhūridatta Jātaka) from the Nāga-world, his brothers set out to search for him, Kānārittha was sent to the world of the gods, for he was so cruel by nature that they knew that if he went to the world of men he would destroy it by fire (J.vi.190).  When, after his search, he returned to the Nāga-world, he was appointed doorkeeper of Bhūridatta's sick-room; there, seeing Subhaga dragging a brahmin roughly into the Nāga-world, he prevented him from ill-treating the man and told him of the greatness of all brahmins, illustrating his words with various stories (J.vi.197; details see pp.200ff).  It is said that in his immediately preceding birth, he had been a brahmin, well-versed in sacrificial lore.  Bhūridatta heard (from his bed) Arittha's undue praise of brahmins and refuted his statements (J.vi.205ff).[/p][p]Kānārittha is identified with Sunakkhatta (J.vi.219).[/p][hr]</entry>

He was once very poor, and Mahā-Kassapa, having spent seven days in samādhi, stood at his door, wishing to do him a favour.  Kākavaliya's wife saw the Elder and poured into his bowl the saltless sour gruel she had cooked for her husband.  The Elder took it and put it into the hands of the Buddha, who resolved that it should suffice for the large assembly of monks.  On the seventh day after that, Kākavaliya was appointed setthi (Vsm.ii.403).  He is quoted as an example of one who was able to give gifts which bore fruit in this very existence, because his gift contained the four purities: lawful acquisition, greatness of volition, virtue in the recipient and consummate virtue in the giver.

  <entry>[div class="huge"]Kanthaka (v.l.  Kannthaka)[/div][p]The horse on which Gotama left his father's palace, accompanied by his attendant Channa.  It is said that when Kanthaka was saddled for the journey, he realised the importance of the hour and neighed loudly for joy, but the gods muffled the sound of his neighing as also that of his footsteps as he galloped through the streets; ordinarily the sound of his neighing and galloping could be heard throughout Kapilavatthu.  He was eighteen cubits long from neck to tail and proportionately broad, quite white in colour, like a clean conch-shell.[/p][p][/p][p]In this journey of Gotama, Channa held on to Kanthaka's tail.  The horse had the strength, had it been necessary, to clear the ramparts of the city, eighteen hands high, at one bound, with the prince and Channa on his back.  Just outside Kapilavatthu the prince stopped the horse, in order to take a last look at the city.  A cetiya was later erected on this spot and called Kanthakanivatta-cetiya.  The horse travelled thirty leagues between midnight and the following morning, as far as the river Anomā.  It is said that Kanthaka could travel round the whole cakka-vāla in one night.  With one leap the horse cleared the river, which was eight fathoms wide.  On arriving on the opposite bank, the Bodhisatta gave orders that Kanthaka should be taken back to Kapilavatthu, but Kanthaka kept looking back at his master, and when the Bodhisatta disappeared from view the horse died of a broken heart, and was reborn in Tāvatimsa under the name of Kanthaka-devaputta.  (J.i.62-5; Mtu.ii.159f., 165, 189, 190; VibhA.34, etc.; Buddhacarita, v.3, 68; vi.53ff).[/p][p][/p][p]Kanthaka was born on the same day as the Bodhisatta (J.i.54; BuA.106, 234, etc.).

One day, when Anāthapindika was away, a gang of robbers tried to enter his house, but Kālakannī, with great presence of mind, asked the few remaining servants to beat drums all over the house, thereby giving the impression that the house was fully occupied.  The robbers fled leaving their weapons, and Kālakannī was greatly praised.

  <entry>[div class="huge"]Kasī-Bhāradvāja[/div][p]A brahmin of the Bhāradvāja clan, living at Ekanālā, in Dakkhināgiri.  The Buddha visited him in the eleventh year after the Enlightenment (Thomas, op.  cit., p.117).  The brahmin was so called on account of his profession of agriculture.  On the day of his festive sowing (mangalavappa), the Buddha visited him alone (having seen his upanissaya for arahantship), and stood near the place where food was being distributed to a very large number of people engaged in the festival.  The brahmin, seeing the Buddha begging for alms, suggests that the Buddha should work for his living - plough and sow just as he does.  (The Sūtrālankāra says the brahmin threw water on the Buddha in order to drive him away; Sylvain Levy, JA.1908, xii.99).  [/p][p]The Buddha answers that he, too, is a farmer, and explains his meaning to the bewildered brahmin, who, greatly pleased, offers him a large bowl filled with milk-rice.  The Buddha refuses the gift on the plea that Buddhas never accept wages for their sermons.  At the Buddha's own suggestion the food is cast into the river because no one is capable of digesting food once offered to a Tathāgata.  (The food had become too rich because the gods had added ojā to it; see also Mil.231).  When the rice touches the water it crackles and smokes and the brahmin, greatly marvelling, falls at the Buddha's feet and professes himself henceforth the Buddha's follower.  Soon after, he enters the Order, and in due course becomes an arahant.

One day Kārandiya was sent with his colleagues by his teacher to accept some cakes offered by the inhabitants of a village and to bring the teacher's share.  On the way back Kārandiya saw a cave and started throwing stones into it.

Soothsayers foretold that the younger would be an ascetic, but that his son would be a Cakka-vatti.  Knowing of this prophecy, Culla Kālinga became so arrogant that Mahā Kālinga, on coming to the throne, ordered his arrest.  But Culla Kālinga fled to Himavā and lived there as an ascetic.  Near his hermitage lived the king and queen of Madda who had fled with their daughter from their city of Sāgala.  Soothsayers had predicted that the princess's son would be a Cakka-vatti, and all the kings of Jambudīpa sought her hand.  Her parents, not wishing to incur the enmity of any of the kings, fled with her from the city.  One day a wreath of mango-flowers which the princess dropped into the river was picked up by Culla Kālinga, who thereupon went in search of her.  With her parents' consent he married her, and to these two was born a son whom they called Kālinga.  [/p][p]When the stars revealed that Mahā Kālinga had died, Kālinga was sent to Dantapura, to a courtier who had been an ally of Culla Kālinga.  The prince's identity having been duly established, he was crowned king, and his chaplain, Kālinga-bhāradvāja, taught him the duties of a Cakka-vatti.  On the fifteenth day after his coronation, the tokens of a Cakka-vatti king appeared before him.  (For details see J.iv.232).  One day while riding through the air with his retinue, he came to the Bodhi-tree under which Buddhas attain Enlightenment, and though he prodded his elephant until it died the animal found it impossible to fly over the spot.  The royal chaplain investigated matters and reported his finding to the king who, having learnt from the chaplain of a Buddha's virtues, paid great honour to the tree for seven days.

  <entry>[div class="huge"]Kanavera Jātaka (No.318)[/div][p]Once the Bodhisatta was born as a robber in a village in Kāsi and became notorious for his banditry.  When the people complained of him to the king, the latter had him arrested by the governor of the province and condemned to death.  While being led to execution with a wreath of red kanavera-flowers on his head, he was seen by Sāmā, the chief courtesan of the city, and she immediately fell in love with him for his comely and striking appearance.  Sāmā, sending word to the governor that the robber was her brother, persuaded him, by means of a bribe of one thousand pieces of money, to set him free and send him to her for a little while.  Then, using all her guile, she substituted for the robber a youth who was enamoured of her and who had happened to visit her that day.  This youth was killed in the place of the robber, who was brought to Sāmā, and she showered on him all her favours.  Fearing that when Sāmā grew tired of him she might betray him, the robber went with her one day into the park and, on the pretence of embracing her, squeezed her till she swooned, then taking all her ornaments, made good his escape.  Sāmā, all unsuspecting, imagined him to have run away from fear of having killed her by his too violent embraces, and she used all her ingenuity in searching for him, such as bribing some wandering minstrels to sing, wherever they went, a set of stanzas declaring that she was still alive and loved none but him, her lover.  One day the robber heard the stanzas and learned from the minstrels that Sāmā still longed for him, but he refused to return, sending her word that he doubted her constancy.  In despair, Sāmā returned to her former means of livelihood.

When he came of age, he entered the Order, learned the whole of the Tipitaka, and, on going with a large concourse to see his teacher, was asked to give up his following and go into solitude to practise meditation.  He went to the Vātakasitapabbata-vihāra, practised meditation and became an arahant.  While living in the Cetiyapabbata-vihāra, he was once worshipping at the Kantaka-cetiya and was seated at the foot of a Kālatimabara tree.  (Legend says on the night of the new moon, thus completing the circle of Kālas).  One of the monks asked him a question on the Kālakārāma Sutta and the Elder preached a sermon based on the sutta.  King Tissa (probably Saddhā-Tissa), who was in the vicinity, came to listen to the sermon, which lasted throughout the night; the king remained standing the whole time.  Greatly pleased, the king, at the end of the sermon, offered the sovereignty of Ceylon to the monk.[/p][p]It is said that the Elder had been the Nigantha Mahā-Saccaka in the time of the Buddha, and that the Buddha had preached to him the Mahā-Saccaka Sutta, not because he could understand it then, but because the Buddha knew that it would help him to rise to eminence in this last life as Kāla-Buddharakkhita.

It was evidently an important centre even in the time of Devānampiya-Tissa, because we find that the nobles of Kājaragāma are mentioned among those taking part in the festival of the Bodhi-Tree when it was brought over by Sanghamittā (Mhv.xix.54).  In the village was planted one of the eight saplings produced from the Bodhi-Tree (Mhv.xix.62; Mbv.161f; Sp.i.100).  A vihāra was erected in Kācaragāma by Aggabodhi, ruler of Rohana (Cv.xlv.45), among the occupants of which is mentioned Milakkha-Tissa Thera (AA.i.22).  The place was of strategic importance, and was sometimes used as the seat of the government in Rohana.  E.g., by Loka (Cv.lvii.2), by Kassapa, the Kesadhātu (Cv.lvii.66ff); see also Cv.lviii.6.

Before he became an arahant he was greatly troubled in mind as to what was permissible for him to use and what was not (akappiyā muggā, na kappanti muggā paribhuñjitum, etc.).  This characteristic of his became well known, hence his name (UdA.314).[/p][p]In the time of Padumuttara he was a brahmin of Hamsavatī, well versed in the Vedas.  One day, while listening to the Buddha's preaching, he heard him declare a monk in the assembly as chief among those who practised jhāna, and himself wished for the same honour under a future Buddha (Ap.ii.419f).  He is often mentioned in company with other very eminent disciples - e.g., Anuruddha, Nandiya, Kimbila, Kundadhāna and Ananda - at the preaching of the Nalakapāna Sutta (M.i.462).  The Mahāgosinga Sutta (M.i.212ff) records a discussion between Moggallāna, Mahā Kassapa, Anuruddha, Revata and Ananda, and there we find Revata praising, as the highest type of monk, one who delights in meditation and has his habitation in the abodes of solitude.[/p][p]Kankhā-Revata appears to have survived the Buddha.[/p][p]In the Uttaramātu-peta Vatthu (PvA.141ff), Uttara's mother having been born as a peta, and having wandered about for fifty-five years without water, came upon Revata enjoying the siesta on the banks of the Ganges and begged him for succor.

Pañcālacanda, pitying the woman, begged that she should be pardoned, because in being unchaste she had but obeyed the instincts common to all women.  To prove his contention, Pañcālacanda took the king with him and, in disguise, they wandered through Jambudīpa, testing the virtue of various women, including that of a young bride who was being taken to her husband's house.  Convinced that all women were alike, the king spared Kinnarā's life, but drove her out of the palace together with the cripple, and caused the jambu-tree to be cut down.[/p][p]The story was among those related by the bird Kunāla to his friend Punnamukha, testifying to the unfaithfulness of women.  Kunāla is identified with Pañcālacanda.  J.v.437-40; J.iii.132.[/p][hr]</entry>

He was the son of a provincial governor in Magadha and was addicted to self-indulgence.  The Buddha, seeing him in his net of wisdom, visited him and admonished him, speaking to him of the filthy nature of the body, illustrating his sermon with a wealth of simile and metaphor.  Kappa was greatly impressed and joined the Order.  He became an arahant, as his head was being shaved.  In the time of the Buddha Siddhattha he was a rich householder, and offered at the Buddha's shrine a kapparukkha containing objects of great value.  Wherever he was born celestial trees grew outside his door.  Seven kappas ago he was eight times king under the name of Sucela (Thag.567-76; ThagA.i.521ff).  He is probably identical with Kapparukkhiya of the Apadāna.  Ap.i.91.[/p][hr][p][b]3. Kappa.[/b]-In the Samyutta Nikāya (S.iii.169f) two suttas are connected with a monk called Kappa, who is probably identical with Kappa (2).  In both suttas he asks the Buddha how it is possible to cultivate knowledge and thought so as to be free from thoughts of "I" and "mine" with regard to the body.  The same questions, receiving the same answers, are elsewhere attributed to Rāhula.  S.ii.253f.[/p][hr][p][b]4. Kappa.[/b]-A young brahmin (Kappakamāra) who was the Bodhisatta.

  <entry>[div class="huge"]Kassapa[/div][hr][p][b]1. Kassapa Buddha.[/b]-Also called Kassapa Dasabala to distinguish him from other Kassapas.  [/p][p]The twenty-fourth Buddha, the third of the present neon (the Bhaddakappa) and one of the seven Buddhas mentioned in the Canon (D.ii.7).  [/p][ul][li][p]He was born in Benares, in the Deer Park at Isipatana, [/p][/li][li][p]of brahmin parents, Brahmadatta and Dhanavatī, belonging to the Kassapagotta.  [/p][/li][li][p]For two thousand years he lived in the household, in three different palaces, Hamsa, Yasa and Sirinanda.  (The BuA.217 calls the first two palaces Hamsavā and Yasavā).  [/p][/li][li][p]He had as chief wife Sunandā, by whom he begot a son, Vijitasena.  [/p][/li][li][p]Kassapa left the world, traveling in his palace (pāsāda), and practiced austerities for only seven days.  [/p][/li][li][p]Just before his Enlightenment his wife gave him a meal of milk-rice, and a yavapāla named Soma gave him grass for his seat.  [/p][/li][li][p]His bodhi was a banyan-tree, and [/p][/li][li][p]he preached his first sermon at Isipatana to a crore of monks who had renounced the world in his company.  [/p][/li][li][p]He performed the Twin-Miracle at the foot of an asana-tree outside Sundaranagara.  [/p][/li][li][p]He held only one assembly of his disciples; among his most famous conversions was that of a yakkha, Naradeva (q.v.).  [/p][/li][li][p]His chief disciples were Tissa and Bhāradvāja among monks, and Anulā and Uruvelā among nuns, his constant attendant being Sabbamitta.  [/p][/li][li][p]Among his patrons, the most eminent were Sumangala and Ghattīkāra, Vijitasenā and Bhaddā.  [/p][/li][li][p]His body was twenty cubits high, and, [/p][/li][li][p]after having lived for twenty thousand years, he died in the Setavya pleasance at Setavyā in Kāsī.  [/p][/li][li][p]Over his relics was raised a thūpa one league in height, each brick of which was worth one crore.  [/p][/li][/ul][p]It is said (MA.i.336ff ) that there was a great difference of opinion as to what should be the size of the thūpa and of what material it should be constructed; when these points were finally settled and the work of building had started, the citizens found they had not enough money to complete it.  Then an anāgāmī devotee, named Sorata, went all over Jambudīpa, enlisting the help of the people for the building of the thūpa.  He sent the money as he received it, and on hearing that the work was completed, he set out to go and worship the thūpa; but he was seized by robbers and killed in the forest, which later came to be known as the  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/andhavana,Andhavana')"]Andhavana[/a].[/p][p]Upavāna, in a previous birth, became the guardian deity of the cetiya, hence his great majesty in his last life (DA.ii.580; for another story of the building of the shrine see DhA.iii.29).[/p][p]Among the thirty-seven goddesses noticed by Guttila, when he visited heaven, was one who had offered a scented five-spray at the cetiya (J.ii.256).  So did Alāta offer āneja-flowers and obtain a happy rebirth (J.vi.227).[/p][p]The cause of Mahā-Kaccāna's golden complexion was his gift of a golden brick to the building of Kassapa's shrine (AA.i.116).[/p][p]At the same cetiya, Anuruddha, who was then a householder in Benares, offered butter and molasses in bowls of brass, which were placed without any interval around the cetiya (AA.i.105).[/p][p]Among those who attained arahantship under Kassapa is mentioned Gavesī, who, with his five hundred followers, strove always to excel themselves until they attained their goal (A.iii.214ff).[/p][p]Mahākappina, then a clansman, built, for Kassapa's monks, a parivena with one thousand cells (AA.i.175).[/p][p]Bakkula's admirable health and great longevity were due to the fact that he had given the first fruits of his harvest to Kassapa's monks (MA.iii.932).  [/p][p]During the time of Kassapa Buddha, the Bodhisatta was a brahmin youth named Jotipāla who, afterwards, coming under the influence of Ghatīkāra, became a monk.  (Bu.xxv.; BuA.217ff; D.ii.7; J.i.43, 94; D.iii.196; Mtu.i.303ff, 319).  This Ghatīkāra was later born in the Brahma-world and visited Gotama, after his Enlightenment.  Gotama then reminded him of this past friendship, which Ghatīkāra seemed too modest to mention (S.i.34f).[/p][p]The Majjhima Nikāya (M.ii.45f ) gives details of the earnestness with which Ghatīkāra worked for Jotipāla's conversion when Kassapa was living at Vehalinga.  The same sutta bears evidence of the great regard Kassapa had for Ghatīkāra.[/p][p]The king of Benares at the time of Kassapa was  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kikii,Kikī')"]Kikī[/a], and the four gateways of Kassapa's cetiya were built, one by Kikī, one by his son Pathavindhara, one by his ministers led by his general, and the last by his subjects with the treasurer at their head (SnA.i.194).[/p][p]It is said that the Buddha's chief disciple, Tissa, was born on the same day as Kassapa and that they were friends from birth.  Tissa left the world earlier and became an ascetic.  When he visited the Buddha after his Enlightenment, he was greatly grieved to learn that the Buddha ate meat (āmagandha), and the Buddha preached to him the  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/aa/aamagandha,Āmagandha Sutta')"]Āmagandha Sutta[/a], by which he was converted (SnA.i.280ff).[/p][p]The Ceylon Chronicles (Mhv.xv.128ff; Sp.i.87; Dpv.xv.55ff; Mbv.129) mention a visit paid by Kassapa to Ceylon in order to stop a war between King Jayanta and his younger brother.  The island was then known as Mandadīpa, with Visāla as capital.  The Buddha came with twenty thousand disciples and stood on Subhakūta, and the armies seeing him stopped the fight.  In gratitude, Jayanta presented to the Buddha the Mahāsāgara garden, in which was afterwards planted a branch of the Bodhi-tree brought over by Sudhammā, in accordance with the Buddha's wish.  The Buddha preached at the Asokamālaka, the Sudassanamālaka and the Somanassamālaka, and gave his rain-cloak as a relic to the new converts, for whose spiritual guidance he left behind his disciples Sabbananda and Sudhammā and their followers.  In Kassapa's time MT. Vepulla at Rājagaha was known as Supassa and its inhabitants as the Suppiyas (S.ii.192).[/p][p]But many other places had the same names in the time of Kassapa as they had in the present age - e.g.,  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/videha,Videha')"]Videha[/a] (J.vi.122),  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/saavatthi,Sāvatthi')"]Sāvatthi[/a] (J.vi.123), [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kimbilaa,Kimbila')"]Kimbila[/a] (J.vi.121) and  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/baranasi,Bārānasī')"]Bārānasī[/a].  (J.vi.120).[/p][p]Besides the Āmagandha Sutta mentioned above, various other teachings are mentioned as having been first promulgated by Kassapa and handed on down to the time of  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/g/gotama,Gotama')"]Gotama[/a] and re-taught by him.  Such, for instance, are the questions (pucchā) of  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/aa/aalavaka_puchaa,Ālavaka')"]Ālavaka[/a] and  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sabhiya,Sabhiya')"]Sabhiya[/a] and the stanzas taught to Sutasoma by the brahmin  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/n/nanda,Nanda')"]Nanda[/a] of Takkasilā (J.v.476f; 453).  The Mittavinda Jātaka (No.104) is mentioned as belonging to the days of Kassapa Buddha (J.i.413).[/p][p]Mention is also made of doctrines which had been taught by Kassapa but forgotten later, and Gotama is asked by those who had heard faint echoes of them to revive them (E.g., MA, i.107, 528; AA.i.423).  A sermon attributed to Kassapa, when he once visited Benares with twenty thousand monks, is included in the story of Pandita-Sāmanera (DhA.ii.127ff).  It was on this occasion that Kassapa accepted alms from the beggar Mahāduggata in preference to those offered by the king and the nobles.[/p][p]Kassapa held the uposatha only once in six months (DhA.iii.236).[/p][p]Between the times of Kassapa and Gotama the surface of the earth grew enough to cover Sūkarakata-lena (MA.ii.677).[/p][p]The records of Chinese pilgrims contain numerous references to places connected with Kassapa.   [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/h/hiuen_tsang,Hiouien Thsang')"]Hiouien Thsang[/a] speaks of a stūpa containing the relics of the whole body of the Buddha, to the north of the town, near Srāvasti, where, according to him, Kassapa was born (Beal, op.  cit., ii.13).  Mention is also made of a footprint of Kassapa (Ibid.i., Introd.  ciii).  Stories of Kassapa are also found in the Divyāvadāna (E.g., pp.22f; 344f; 346f; see also Mtu., e.g., i.59, 303f).  [/p][p]The Dhammapada Commentary (iii.250f ) contains a story, which seems to indicate that, near the village of Todeyya, there was a shrine thought to be that of Kassapa and held in high honour by the inhabitants of the village.  After the disappearance of Kassapa's Sāsana, a class of monks called Setavattha-samanavamsa ("white-robed recluses") tried to resuscitate it, but without success (VibhA.432).[/p][hr][p][b]2. Kassapa Thera.[/b]-The son of an Udicca-brahmin of Sāvatthi, who died when Kassapa was still young.  Having heard the Buddha preach at Jetavana, he entered the First Fruit of the Path and, with his mother's leave, became a monk.  Some time later, wishing to accompany the Buddha on a tour after the rains, he went to bid his mother farewell, and her admonition to him on that occasion helped him to win insight and become an arahant (Thag.v.82).[/p][p]In the time of Padumuttara Buddha he had been a brahmin versed in the Vedas.  One day, seeing the Buddha and wishing to pay homage, he cast a handful of sumana-flowers into the air over the Buddha's head, and the flowers formed a canopy in the sky.  In later births he was twenty-five times king, under the name of Cinnamāla (v.l.  Cittamāla).  (ThagA.i.177f ).[/p][p]He is probably identical with Sereyyaka Thera of the Apadāna.[/p][hr][p][b]3. Kassapa.[/b]-A devaputta.  He visited the Buddha late one night at Jetavana and uttered several stanzas, admonishing monks to train themselves in their tasks, laying particular stress on the cultivation of Jhāna (S.i.46).[/p][p]Buddhaghosa says (SA.i.82) that Kassapa had heard the Buddha preach the Abhidhamma in Tāvatimsa.  Having heard only a portion of the doctrine and not being sure of the admonition given by the Buddha to the monks regarding the practice of Jhāna-vibhanga, Kassapa thought he could supply the omission.  The Buddha, knowing his capabilities, allowed him to give his views, and expressed his approval at the end of Kassapa's speech.[/p][hr][p][b]4. Kassapa.[/b]-A sage (isi); one of the famous sages of yore, of whom ten are several times mentioned in the books (E.g., D.i.104, 238; M.ii.169, 200; A.iii.224; iv.61; J.vi.99) as having been brahmin sages, who composed and promulgated the mantras and whose compositions are chanted and repeated and rehearsed by the brahmins of the present day.

Kassapa.-[/b] A setthi, probably of Rājagaha, who built the Kassapakārāma, named after him.  SA.ii.230.[/p][hr][p][b]12. Kassapa.[/b]-Son of Dhātusena by a morganatic marriage.  He slew his father and became king of Ceylon as Kassapa I.  (478-96 A.C.).  Fearing the revenge of his brother Moggallāna, he erected the fortress at Sīhagiri and dwelt there.  Later, repenting of his patricide, he did many meritorious deeds by way of amends (for details see Cv.xxxix.8ff), chief of which was the restoration of the Issarasamanārāma, to which he added buildings named after his daughters, Bodhī and Uppalavannā.  In a fight with his brother's forces his army fled in disorder, and Kassapa cut his throat with a dagger.  Cv.xxxviii.80ff.; xxxix.1ff.[/p][hr][p][b]13. Kassapa.[/b]-Son of Upatissa III.  of Ceylon.  He had sixteen companions as brave as himself and, with their help, several times repulsed the attacks of Silākāla, when the latter revolted against the king.  He became known as Girikassapa on account of his prowess.  In the last campaign Silākāla was victorious, and Kassapa, with his parents and his loyal followers, fled to Merukandara, but they lost their way and were surrounded by Silākāla.  When the royal elephant fell Kassapa cut his own throat.  Cv.xli.8-25.[/p][hr][p][b]14. Kassapa.[/b]-Younger brother of Aggabodhi III.; he was made viceroy when Māna was killed (Cv.xliv.123f).  When Aggabodhi had recovered the kingdom from the usurper Dāthopatissa, which he did only after various reverses in his fortunes, Kassapa abused his influence and plundered various sacred edifices to provide for his army (Cv.xliv.137f).  On Aggabodhi's death in exile in Rohana, Kassapa defeated Dāthopatissa, who claimed the throne, and became king in his place (Kassapa II.  641-50).  He did not, however, wear a crown, the regalia having probably been stolen.  As king he repented of his former misdeeds and did various acts of merit (Cv.xliv.147ff; xlv.1ff).  He paid special honour to Mahādhammakathī Thera of Nāgasālā and to the Thera of Katandhakāra.[/p][p]His children all being young at the time of his death, he entrusted the government to his sister's son, Māna (Cv.xlv.8).  According to the chronicles, Mānavamma was the son of Kassapa (Cv.xlvii.2).  He also had a son named Mana (Cv.lvii.4).[/p][hr][p][b]15. Kassapa[/b] (Kassapa III., 717-24 A.C.).-A younger brother of Aggabodhi V.  (?); Kassapa's younger brother was Mahinda I (Cv.xlviii.20-26) and his son Aggabodhi (Cv.xlviii.32).[/p][hr][p][b]16. Kassapa.[/b]-One of the three younger brothers of Sena I., the others being Mahinda and Udaya (Cv.l.6).  Kassapa was appointed Ādipāda and fought valiantly against the forces of the Pandu king, who was then invading Ceylon, but, finding his efforts of no avail, he fled to Kondivāta (Cv.vv.25ff).  He was later killed at Pulatthipura by the orders of the Pandu king (Cv.vv.46).  He had four sons, the eldest of whom was named Sena (Cv.vv.47).[/p][hr][p][b]17. Kassapa[/b].-Son of Kittaggabodhi, ruler of Rohana.  When his eldest brother was murdered by his paternal aunt, Kassapa fled to the court of King Sena I., but, later, with Sena's help, he won his father's inheritance (Cv.l.54ff).  He was probably killed by the Adipāda Kittaggabodhi.  Cv.li.96; and Cv.Trs.i.157, n.2.[/p][hr][p][b]18. Kassapa.[/b]-Younger brother of Sena II.  and Udaya II.  He was Mahādipāda or Yuvarāja under Udaya (Cv.li.91), and later became king as Kassapa IV.  (896-913 A.C.) (Cv.lii.1ff).  His daughter Sena married Kassapa V.  (Cv.li.93)[/p][hr][p][b]19. Kassapa.[/b]-Son of Sena II.  The king gave him a special share of his own revenues and a share of the extraordinary revenues of the island (Cv.li.18, 20).  Two wives of his are mentioned: Sanghā and Senā (Cv.li.18, 92).  He became Yuvarāja under Kassapa IV.  and ruled over Dakkhinadesa (Cv.lii.1), and, at the death of the king, he became ruler of Ceylon as Kassapa V.  (probably 913-23 A.C.) (Cv.lii.37ff).  He is sometimes referred to as the son of the twice-consecrated queen (dvayābhisekajāta), his mother being Sanghā, daughter of Kittaggabodhi (1) and Devā.  In inscriptions Kassapa is referred to as Abhaya-Silāmegha-vanna (Cv.Trs.i.165, n.3).  He was evidently a learned man, and a Sinhalese Commentary to the Dhammapadatthakathā is attributed to him (Edited by D.  B.  Jayatilaka, Colombo 1933).  He had one wife, Vajirā (Cv.lii.62), a second, Devā (Cv.lii.64), and a third, Rājinī (Cv.lii.67).  He had a son, Siddhattha, who died young, and another, who was given the title of Sakkasenāpati.  The latter led an expedition to help the Pandu king against the King of Cola, but he died of plague in Cola (Cv.lii.72-8).[/p][hr][p][b]20. Kassapa.[/b]-Son of Sena V.  (Cv.liv.69)[/p][hr][p][b]21. Kassapa.[/b]-Son of Mahinda V.  (Cv.lv.10).  When Mahinda was captured and taken away by the Colas, the people took charge of the young Kassapa and brought him up.  When the boy was twelve years old the Cola king sent an army over to Ceylon to seize him; but this plan was frustrated by the official Kitti, of Makkhakudrūsa, and the minister Buddha, of Māragallaka (Cv.lv.24-9).  Kassapa ascended the throne as Vikkamabāhu, but refused to be crowned until he should have conquered the Damilas in his kingdom.  While preparations were afoot towards this end, he died of a vātaroga.  He reigned twelve years (1029-1041 A.C.).  (Cv.lvi.1-6; Cv.Trs.i.190, n.3).  He is perhaps to be identified with the prince Kassapa who married Lokitā, cousin of Mahinda V., and by whom he had two sons, Moggallāna and Loka.  Cv.lvii.28f; Cv.Trs.i.195, n.3.[/p][hr][p][b]22. Kassapa.[/b]-Chief of the Kesadhātus (q.v.).  For some time he carried on the government at Rohana, where he defeated the Damilas.  He refused to own allegiance to Kitti (afterwards Vijayabāhu I.), and after six months of rule in Khadirangani, full of resentment that his services against the Damilas had not been recognised, he marched against Kitti and was slain in a battle near Kājaragāma.  Cv.lvii.65-75.[/p][hr][p][b]23. Kassapa[/b].-A prince of Jambudīpa who, during the reign of Parakkamabāhu I.  of Ceylon, sent costly gifts to the king of Rāmañña; the Rāmañña king forbade the envoys to land and insulted them.  This is mentioned as one of the acts which led Parakkamabāhu to send an expedition against Rāmañña.  Cv.lxxvi.28f[/p][hr][p][b]24. Kassapa Thera[/b].-According to the Gandhavamsa (p.61) he was the author of the Anāgatavamsa and also of the Mohavicchedanī, the Vimaticchedanī and the Buddhavamsa.  This Buddhavamsa is evidently not the canonical work of the same name.  The Sāsanavamsadīpa (Verse 1204, see also 1221) says that a Kassapa, an inhabitant of Cola, was the author of a Vimativinodanī.  The Sāsanavamsa (p.33; see also P.L.C.160) calls this a Vinayatīkā and the author an inhabitant of the Damila country.  The Mohavicchedanī is there described as a lakkhanagandha (a treatise on grammar?) and is ascribed to another Kassapa.[/p][hr][p][b]25. Kassapa.[/b]-A Kassapa Thera is mentioned in the Sāsanavamsa (p.50) as having been among those responsible for the establishment of the religion in Yonakarattha.  He was an inhabitant of Majjhimadesa.[/p][hr][p][b]26. Kassapa.[/b]-The Sāsanavamsa (p.71) mentions a Kassapa Thera of Arimaddana, in the time of King Narapati.  While on tour he reached a country called Pollanka, where the people grew very fond of him and where he became known as Pollanka Thera.  Some time later he was crossing to Ceylon and the vessel in which he was refused to move.  Lots were drawn, as it was necessary to discover who aboard the vessel was the sinner.  The lot fell repeatedly on Kassapa, because, in a former life, he had harassed a dog in the water.  He was accordingly thrown overboard, but was rescued by Sakka, in the form of a crocodile.  The thera reached Yakkhadīpa (q.v.) and there, as a result of practising compassion, the blind yakkhas gained their sight.  Kassapa went later to Sīhaladīpa, whence he returned home with relics and seeds of the Bodhi-tree and models of the Mahācetiya and Lohapāsāda.[/p][hr][p][b]27.

  <entry>[div class="huge"]Kārandava Sutta[/div][p]Once, while the Buddha was at Campā on the banks of the Gaggarā Lake, a monk, charged by his colleagues with an offence, reviled them; the Buddha, hearing of it, insisted that the man should be expelled, lest the rest of the community should suffer by his presence.  He illustrated his argument with various similes, among them that of the owner of a barley-field who, seeing among his corn a diseased plant (yava-kārandava) which failed to ripen, would uproot it and throw it away lest the other plants should be affected.

[/p][/li][li][p]His bodhi was a Sirīsa-tree, and his first sermon was preached to eighty-four thousand monks in the park near the city of Makila.  [/p][/li][li][p]He performed the Twin-Miracle under a Sāla-tree at the gates of Kannakujja.  Among his converts was a fierce yakkha named Naradeva.  [/p][/li][li][p]He held only one assembly of his monks.  [/p][/li][li][p]Kakusandha's body was forty cubits in height, and he died at the age of forty thousand years in the Khema pleasaunce.  [/p][/li][li][p]The thūpa erected over his relics was one league high.[/p][/li][/ul][p]The Bodhisatta was at that time a king named Khema.  The Buddha's chief disciples were Vidhura and Sañjīva among monks, and Sama and Campā among nuns.  His personal attendant was Buddhija.  Accuta and Samana, Nandā and Sunandā were his most eminent lay-supporters (D.ii.7; Bu.xxiii; J.i.42; BuA.209ff).  Kakusandha kept the fast-day (uposatha) every year (DhA.iii.236).  In Kakusandha's time a Māra, named Dūsī (a previous birth of Moggallāna), gave a great deal of trouble to the Buddha and his followers, trying greatly the Buddha's patience (M.i.333ff; Thag.1187).  The Samyutta Nikāya (S.ii.190f) mentions that during the time of Kakusandha, the Mount Vepulla of Rājagaha was named Pācīna-vamsa and the inhabitants were called Tivarā.[/p][p][/p][p]The monastery built by Accuta on the site where, in the present age, Anāthapindika erected the Jetavanārāma, was half a league in extent, and the ground was bought by golden kacchapas sufficient in number to cover it (J.i.94).[/p][p]According to the Ceylonese chronicles (Dpv.ii.66; xv.25, 34; xvii.9, 16, etc.; Mhv.xv.57-90), Kakusandha paid a visit to Ceylon.  The island was then known as Ojadīpa and its capital was Abhayanagara, where reigned King Abhaya.  The Mahāmeghavana was called Mahātittha.  The Buddha came, with forty thousand disciples, to rid the island of a pestilence caused by yakkhas and stood on the Devakūta mountain from where, by virtue of his own desire, all inhabitants of the country could see him.  The Buddha and his disciples were invited to a meal by the king, and after the meal the Mahātittha garden was presented to the Order; there the Buddha sat, in meditation, in order to consecrate various spots connected with the religion.  At the Buddha's wish, the nun Rucānandā brought to the island a branch of the sacred bodhi-tree.  The Buddha gave to the people his own drinking-vessel as an object of worship, and returned to Jambudīpa, leaving behind his disciples Mahādeva and Rucānandā to look after the spiritual welfare of the new converts to the faith.[/p][p]In Buddhist Sanskrit texts the name of the Buddha is given as Krakucchanda (See especially Divy.254, 418f; Mtu.iii.247, 330).[/p][hr][p]2.

  <entry>[div class="huge"]Cūlapanthaka Thera[/div][p]An eminent arahant, declared chief among monks skilled in creating forms by mind-power and in mental "evolution" (cittavivatta) (A.i.23).  He was the younger son of the daughter of a rich merchant of Rājagaha, who developed intimacy with a slave and fled with him when her misconduct was discovered.  She wished to return to her parents for the birth of her first child, but her husband always postponed the visit until, in the end, she started to go without his knowledge.  He followed her, but the child was born by the wayside, and therefore they called him Panthaka.  The same thing occurred at the birth of the second child, and he also received the name of Panthaka, he being Cūlapanthaka and his brother Mahāpanthaka.  When the boys grew up they were taken to Rājagaha, where their grandparents took charge of them.  Mahāpanthaka often accompanied his grandfather to hear the Buddha preach, and he yearned to become a monk.  He easily obtained permission and entered the Order, in due course becoming an arahant.  With the consent of his grandparents, he ordained Cūlapanthaka, but the latter proved to be a dullard, and in the course of four months was unable to learn a single stanza.  It is said that in the time of Kassapa Buddha Cūlapanthaka was a clever monk, who once laughed to scorn a dull colleague who was trying to learn a passage by heart.[/p][p]When Mahāpanthaka discovered his brother's stupidity, he asked him to leave the Order (see DhA.iv.190f), but Cūlapanthaka so loved the Buddha's teaching that he did not wish to return to the lay-life.  One day Jīvaka Komārabhacca, wishing to give alms to the Buddha and the monks, asked Mahāpanthaka, who was acting as steward, to collect all the monks in the monastery.  This he did, omitting only Cūlapanthaka who, he said, had made no progress in the Doctrine.  Greatly grieved, Cūlapanthaka determined to leave the Order, but as he was going out the Buddha met him, took him into the Gandhakuti and comforted him, giving him a clean piece of cloth.  "Sit with your face to the East," said the Buddha, "repeat the words 'rajoha-ranam' and wipe your face with the cloth." As Cūlapanthaka carried out these orders he noticed that the cloth became dirty, and as he concentrated his mind on the impermanence of all things, the Buddha sent a ray of light and exhorted him about the necessity of getting rid of the impurities of lust and other evils.  At the end of the admonition Cūlapanthaka attained arahantship with the four patisambhidā, which included knowledge of all the Pitakas.[/p][p]Tradition has it that Cūlapanthaka was once a king and that while going in procession round his city he wiped the sweat from his brow with a spotless garment which he wore and noticed how the cloth was stained.  His mind then grasped the idea of impermanence, hence the ease with which he did so in his last birth.[/p][p]Meanwhile, the Buddha and the monks were seated in Jīvaka's house, but when the meal was about to be served the Buddha ordered it to be stopped, saying that there were other monks left in the monastery.  A servant was sent to find them, and Cūlapanthaka, aware of this, contrived that the whole grove appeared full of monks engaged in various activities.  When the messenger reported this, he was told to discover which of the monks was Cūlapanthaka and to bring him.  But all the monks answered to this name, and the messenger was forced to return without him.  "Take by the hand the first who says that he is Cūlapanthaka," ordered the Buddha; and when this was done the other figures vanished.  At the conclusion of the meal, Cūlapanthaka was asked to return thanks, and "like a young lion roaring defiance" the Elder ranged over the whole of the Pitakas in his sermon.  Thenceforth his fame spread, and the Buddha, in order to prove how in previous births also Cūlapanthaka had profited by advice received, related to the monks the Cullakasetthi Jātaka (Thag.557-66; AA.i.119ff; J.i.114ff; DhA.i.239ff; ThagA.i.515ff; Vsm.388f).[/p][p][/p][p]The Dhammapada Commentary (i.250ff) gives another story of Cūlapanthaka's past.  He went to Takkasilā to learn under a teacher, but though he did everything for his teacher he could learn nothing.  The teacher, feeling sorry for him, taught him a charm: "Ghattesi ghattesi, kim kāranā ghattesi? āham pi tam jānāmi" ("You try and try; what are you trying for? I know it too").  When he had returned home thieves entered his house, but he woke up from his sleep and repeated the charm, whereupon the thieves fled, leaving behind them even their clothes.  The king of Benares, wandering about the city in disguise, seeing what had happened, sent for Cūlapanthaka the next day and learnt from him the charm after paying him one thousand.  Soon after-wards the king's commander-in-chief bribed the court barber to cut the king's throat, but while the barber was sharpening his razor the king repeated the charm.  The barber, thinking that his intended crime was discovered, confessed his guilt.  The king, realising that the youth had saved his life, appointed him commander-in-chief in place of the traitor, whom he banished.  The youth was Cūlapanthaka and the teacher was the Bodhisatta.[/p][p]Cūlapanthaka was a householder in the time of Padumuttara Buddha, and having seen a monk exalted by the Buddha to the rank of chief among those skilled in creating mind-born forms, aspired to the same position.  In the time of Kassapa Buddha he was a monk and practised odātakasina for twenty thousand years (AA.i.119).[/p][p]Cūlapanthaka was expert in rūpajjhāna and in samādhi, while his brother was skilled in arūpajjhāna and in vipassanā.  When creating forms, other monks could produce only two or three, while Cūlapanthaka could bring into being as many as one thousand at the same time, no two being alike in appearance or action (ThagA.i.490; PsA.276).[/p][p]According to the Apadāna (i.58f), Cūlapanthaka joined the Order at the age of eighteen.  It is said (Vin.iv.54f) that when it was his turn to teach the nuns at Sāvatthi they expected no effective teaching, since he always repeated the same stanza.  One day, at the end of the lesson, he overheard their remarks, and forthwith gave an exhibition of his magical powers and of his wide knowledge of the Buddha's teachings.  The nuns listened with great admiration until after sunset, when they were unable to gain entrance to the city.  The Buddha heard of this and warned Cūlapanthaka not to keep the nuns so late.[/p][p]The Udāna (v.10; UdA.319f) contains a verse sung by the Buddha in praise of Cūlapanthaka, and the Milinda (p.368) quotes a stanza attributed to Cūlapanthaka which has so far not been traced elsewhere.[/p][hr]</entry>

One day, while on his way to the palace, he saw a dead mouse lying on the road, and, noticing the position of the stars, he said, "Any decent young fellow with his wits about him has only to pick up the mouse and he will be a made man." A young man of good family, called Cullantevāsika, hearing this, picked up the mouse and sold it for a farthing to a tavern for their cat to eat.  With the farthing he bought molasses and drinking water for flower-gatherers.  Later, he gathered branches and leaves blown down by the wind in the king's garden and sold them to a potter for a large sum of money.  He entered into friendship with a land-trader and a sea-trader and, by using the information he obtained from them, he was able to make two hundred thousand pieces by means of skilful and far-sighted business dealings.  He then visited Cullasetthi to express to him his gratitude, and the setthi, on hearing of his skill, was so impressed that he gave him his daughter in marriage.[/p][p]The young man is identified with Cullapanthaka (q.v.), in reference to whom the story was related.

It is elsewhere stated that in Kassapa's time Candana and Lomasakangiya were friends and that both became monks.  (ThagA.i.84f.  In this version not Candana, but Lomasakangiya, expounds the Sutta; in M.iii.199f.it is Candana).[/p][p]When Kassapa preached the Bhaddekaratta Sutta, Candana asked Lomasakangiya to explain it; this he was unable to do, and so made a wish that he should be able to explain it in a future birth, Candana wishing that he should then ask the questions again.  Both wishes were fulfilled.  For details see Lomasakangiya (2).[/p][p][/p][p]2. Candana Thera.-He belonged to a rich family in Sāvatthi, and having heard the Buddha preach, became a sotāpanna.  When a son was born to him he joined the Order and took to meditating in the forest.  Later he dwelt in a charnel-field near Sāvatthi.  There he was visited by his wife and child who hoped to win him back, but, seeing them from afar, he made a special effort and became an arahant, preaching to his wife as she approached (Thag.vs.299-302; ThagA.i.395f).[/p][p]Thirty-one kappas ago he was a tree-sprite, and having seen the Pacceka Buddha Sudassana, gave him a kutaja-flower.  He is probably identical with Kutajapupphiya Thera of the Apaddna.  (ii.451; the same verses are also ascribed to Hārita).[/p][p][/p][p]3.

One day some of his flock came upon Lake Mānusiya, near the haunts of men, and finding it a rich feeding-ground, persuaded him much against his will to go there with them.  But immediately he alighted he was caught in a fowler's noose and found escape impossible.  He waited till the flock had fed, then gave the cry of alarm at which all the geese flew away except his commander-in-chief, Sumukha.  When the fowler came, Sumukha offered to give his life for his king, and thereby softened the fowler's heart.  The latter set Dhatarattha free and tended his wounds, and because of the man's great charity the king of the geese became whole again.  When the fowler suggested that they should fly home, the two geese insisted that they should be taken to Sakula, the king of the land, the Mahimsaka country, that they might obtain for the fowler a suitable reward.  When the king heard the story he gave to the fowler a village yielding one hundred thousand annually, a chariot and a large store of gold.  Dhatarattha preached to the king the moral law and, after being paid great honour, returned to Cittakūta.[/p][p][/p][p]The story was related in reference to Ananda's attempt to offer his life in order to save the Buddha from being killed by the elephant Nālāgiri (q.v.).

There was no food to be had, and Sakka provided the monks with a raft on which to cross the sea.  Sixty monks, however, remained in Ceylon, guarding the scriptures.  Twelve years later, when the danger was past, the monks who had left the land returned and dwelt in the Mandalārāma in Kallagāma (Kālakagāma?).

This the Cakkaratana does, carrying with it through the air the Cakkavatti with his fourfold army.  Wherever the Cakkaratana halts, all the chiefs of that quarter acclaim the Cakkavatti as their overlord and declare their allegiance to him.  Having thus traversed the four quarters of the earth, it returns to the Cakkavatti's capital, and remains fixed as an ornament on the open terrace in front of his inner apartments (D.ii.173f; M.iii.173ff).[/p][p]The Commentaries (E.g., DA.ii.617ff; MA.ii.942ff) contain lengthy descriptions of the Cakkaratana: it is shaped like a wheel, its nave is of sapphire, the centre of which shines like the orb of the moon, and round it is a band of silver.  It has one thousand spokes, each ornamented with various decorations; its tyre is of bright coral; within every tenth spoke is a coral staff, hollow inside, which produces the sounds of the fivefold musical instruments when blown upon by the wind.  On the staff is a white parasol, on either side of which are festoons of flowers.  When the wheel moves, it appears like three wheels moving one within the other.[/p][p]When a Cakkavatti dies or leaves the world, the Cakkaratana disappears from the sight of men for seven days; it gives warning of a Cakkavatti's impending death by slipping from its place some time before the event (D.iii.59f.; MA.ii.885).

  <entry>[div class="huge"]Cullabodhi Jātaka (No.443)[/div][p]The Bodhisatta, under the name of Bodhi (he is also referred to as Culla-bodhi), was once born in a very rich family of Kāsi and studied in Takkasilā.  His parents married him to a suitable wife but, because they had both come from the Brahma-world, they were free from passionate desire.  After his parents' death, the two distributed their wealth and became ascetics.  One day they came to the king's park, and there the king fell in love with the woman and carried her away by force to the palace.  When he told the Bodhisatta of this, he showed no resentment whatever.  In the palace the king found that he could not win the woman's love, and returned to the park, curious to know whether the ascetic really meant what he said.  In the course of conversation the Bodhisatta told the king that he did not give way to anger because anger, once awakened, is difficult to curb.[/p][p]The story was related in reference to a monk of violent temper.  The king was Ananda and the Bodhisatta's wife was Rāhulamātā.  (J.iv.22-27.

The geese replied that not food but character made people comely; the crow was too greedy ever to be beautiful.[/p][p]The story was told in reference to a greedy monk who went from house to house in search of dainty food, frequenting the dwellings of the rich.

[/p][p]When Mahānāma visited Macchikāsanda, Citta, pleased with his demeanour, invited him to his park, the Ambātakārāma, and built for him a monastery there.  And there the Elder preached to Citta the Salā-yatana-vibhatti and Citta became an Anāgāmī.  Thereafter many monks visited the Ambātakārāma and accepted Citta's hospitality.  Among them was Isidatta (q.v.), a former acquaintance of Citta, but Isidatta left when he found that his identity had been discovered.  Mahānāma and Mahaka did likewise, after having performed miracles at the request of Citta.  [/p][p]The Citta Samyutta (S.iv.282ff) contains a record of conversations between Citta and members of the Order, among whom, besides those already mentioned, were Kāmabhū and Godatta.  Citta is also said to have had discussions with Nigantha Nātaputta and Acela Kassapa and to have refuted their views.[/p][p]A thera named Sudhamma was a permanent resident in the Ambātakārāma and was looked after by Citta.  Once, when the two Chief Disciples and several other eminent Elders came to the Ambātakārāma, Citta invited first these and then Sudhamma; the latter, feeling slighted, blamed Citta beyond measure, but the Buddha, hearing of this, sent Sudhamma to ask for Citta's pardon (Vin.ii.15ff; DhA.ii.74f; for details see Sudhamma).[/p][p]Some time later, Citta visited the Buddha.  He was accompanied by two thousand others and took with him five hundred cartloads of offerings to the Buddha and the Order.  As he fell at the feet of the Buddha, flowers of five hues showered from the sky and the Buddha preached to him the Salāyatana-vibhatti.  For a fortnight he continued distributing his gifts to the Order and the devas filled his carts with all kinds of valuables (AA.i.210).[/p][p]When Citta lay ill just before his death, devas visited him and advised him to wish for kingship among them, but he refused to aspire to anything so impermanent, and instructed the devas and his kinsfolk gathered round him, telling them of the Buddha and his teachings (S.iv.302f).  He is regarded as the ideal layman (E.g., at A.i.88; ii.164; iii.451).[/p][p]He owned a tributary village called Migapattaka (SA.iii.93).[/p][p]In the time of Padumuttara Buddha, Citta conceived his desire to be placed first among laymen in the teaching of the Dhamma.  In the time of Kassapa Buddha he was a huntsman.  One day, seeing a monk in a glen, and being pleased thereat, he hurried home, prepared a meal and brought it to the monk, together with flowers he had gathered on the way.  After the offering, he made a wish that he should never lack for tribute and that showers of flowers should fall on him.  In the deva-world he surpassed all others in his great beauty (AA.i.209).

When the friend expressed a desire to return to household life, Citta encouraged him to do so, coveting his belongings.  This was the reason for Citta's inability to remain in the Order.  He was a friend of Potthapāda, and when he had returned for the sixth time to a householder's life, Potthapāda brought him to the Buddha.  Citta listened to their conversation and asked questions regarding personality.  At the end of the discourse (recounted in the Potthapāda Sutta) Citta once more joined the Order, never again to leave it, for he soon after became an arahant (D.i.199ff).[/p][p]The  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kuddaala_jat_70,Kuddāla Jātaka')"]Kuddāla Jātaka[/a] (J.i.311f) gives the circumstances in which he first joined the Order.

In order to gain similar food for himself, he became a monk, but soon after, lust overcame him and he left the homeless life.  Even after he became an arahant his colleagues are said to have taunted him, asking when he would be leaving them, and it was only when the Buddha told them that such a time would never be were they satisfied.[/p][p]The same story, except for certain details, is also found in the Dhammapada Commentary (DhA.i.305ff), but there Citta is called Cittahattha, and a different explanation is given of his name: esa cittavasiko hutvā vicarati ti Cittahatthan ti nāmam karimsu.  It is further stated that on the last occasion of his leaving home he saw his pregnant wife lying asleep and was so filled with, revolt that he returned to the Order.  He started forth at once, a yellow robe tied round his waist, and as he walked to the vihāra, he became a sotāpanna.

Ananda gently reminded him that being grey-haired he could hardly be called a boy, but Kassapa refused to listen.  Thulla-Nandā, hearing of this, vented her displeasure on Kassapa by reminding him that he was once a heretical teacher.  Kassapa there-upon remonstrated with Ananda, pointing out that he was a very devoted follower and pupil of the Buddha and relating how, on one occasion, the Buddha accepted from him the gift of his soft robe, giving him, in return, the Buddha's rag-robe.

He proceeds to describe how he, too, failed to find satisfaction before his Enlightenment.  He then tells of a conversation he once had on Gijjhakūta with some Niganthas, who believed that suffering could be got rid of through austerities and how he told them of his happiness which was far greater even than that of Bimbisāra, king of Magadha.

Immediately the memory of her life as Cullasubhaddā, Chaddanta's consort, came to her mind and she laughed for joy; but on further recollecting that she had been the instrument of his death, she wept aloud.

  <entry>[div class="huge"]Ciñcā-mānavikā[/div][p]A paribbājikā of some ascetic Order.  When the heretics of this Order found that their gains were grown less owing to the popularity of the Buddha, they enlisted the support of Ciñcā in their attempts to discredit him.  She was very beautiful and full of cunning, and they persuaded her to pretend to pay visits to the Buddha at Jetavana.  She let herself be seen going towards the vihāra in the evening, spent the night in the heretics' quarters near by, and in the morning men saw her returning from the direction of the vihāra.  When questioned, she said that she had passed the night with the Buddha.  After some months she simulated pregnancy by tying a disc of wood round her body and appearing thus before the Buddha, as he preached to a vast congregation, she charged him with irresponsibility and callousness in that he made no provision for her confinement.  The Buddha remained silent, but Sakka's throne was heated and he caused a mouse to sever the cords of the wooden disc, which fell to the ground, cutting Ciñcā's toes.  She was chased out of the vihāra by those present, and as she stepped outside the gate the fires of the lowest hell swallowed her up (DhA.iii.178f; J.iv.187f; ItA.69).[/p][p][/p][p]In a previous birth, too, she had helped in various ways to harm the Bodhisatta.

The Elders Mahānāga and Cūlanāga lived at Cittalapabbata for three years (SA.ii.125).  The Commentaries" contain several stories connected with the mountain.

On the eighth day of the lunar half-month, they send their councillors out into the world to discover if men cultivate righteousness and virtue; on the fourteenth day they send their sons, on the fifteenth day they themselves appear in the world, all these visits having the same purpose.  Then, at the assembly of the devas, they submit their report to the gods of Tāvatimsa, who rejoice or lament according as to whether men prosper in righteousness or not (A.i.142f.; for more details see AA.i.376f).  [/p][p]These four Gods surpass the other inhabitants of their worlds in ten ways - beauty, length of life, etc.  - because their merit is greater than that of the others (A.iv.242).[/p][p]Besides these Regent Gods and their followers, other dwellers are to be found in their world - the Khiddāpadosikā, the Manopadosikā, the Sitavalāhakā, the Unhavalāhakā, and the devaputtas Candima and Suriya (VibhA.519; MNidA.108).

In a past life he was the Sumanasetthi, under whom Annabhārā (q.v.) worked.  In this age he was born at Munda, near the Viñjhā mountains, as the son of Mahāmunda.  When Anuruddha became an arahant and looked back into his past lives he saw how Sumana had helped him.  He therefore visited Mahāmunda and enjoyed his hospitality during one rainy season.  At the end of his stay he obtained Munda's consent to ordain Cūlasumana, who became an arahant while his head was being shaved.  Once, when Anuruddha suffered from indigestion, the novice Sumana, having discovered that the water from Anotatta would cure him, went there and brought the water, in spite of all the efforts of the Nāga-king Pannaka (q.v.) to prevent him.  Later, Pannaka, realising the novice's power, asked his pardon and became his friend and servitor.  When Anuruddha went with Sumana to Sāvatthi to visit the Buddha, some of the monks began to play with Sumana, patting his head and tweaking his ears.  In order to show them Sumana's power, Anuruddha asked Ananda to summon all the novices in the monastery and ask them to fetch water from Anotatta that he might wash his feet.  Only Sumana, the youngest of them all, was able to do this, and his fame spread beyond all measure (DhA.iv.128ff).[/p][hr]</entry>

But he was an unbeliever, and when Niganthas came to his house on invitation, Subhaddā refused to do obeisance to them.  For this she was ordered out of the house by her father-in-law; but she convinced her mother-in-law that the reasons for her behaviour were sound, and at the suggestion of the latter she prepared a meal and invited to it the Buddha and the congregation of monks, by throwing into the air from the top storey of the house eight handfuls of jasmine.  The Buddha divined her thoughts and arrived with five hundred arahants.  After the meal the Buddha preached the Doctrine and Ugga and his family were converted.  As a mark of favour towards Subhaddā the Buddha requested Anuruddha to stay behind at Ugganagara.  (DhA.iii.465ff; the story is also given in AA.ii.482ff, but with several variations in detail.

He is only mentioned once, in the Anguttara Nikāya (A.iii.215), where we are told that he visited Ananda at Sāvatthi and asked him questions about the Buddha's teaching (see Channa Sutta below).  Both the Sutta and the Commentary (AA.i.432) add that he was pleased with Ananda's explanation, and admitted that the Buddha's teachings were worthy of being followed, though it is not explicitly stated that he accepted them.[/p][hr][p][b]2. Channa.[/b]-A Thera.  No particulars of his early life are available.  He once stayed at Gijjhakūta, dangerously ill and suffering much pain.  He was visited by Sāriputta and Mahā Cunda, and when they discovered that he contemplated suicide, they tried to deter him, promising to provide him with all necessaries and to wait on him themselves.  Finding him quite determined, Sāriputta discussed with him the Buddha's teachings and then left him.  Soon afterwards Channa committed suicide by cutting his throat.  When this was reported to the Buddha, he explained that no blame was attached to Channa, for he was an arahant at the moment of death (M.iii.263ff; S.iv.55ff).[/p][p]Buddhaghosa explains (MA.ii.1012f.; SA.iii.12f ) that after cutting his throat, Channa, feeling the fear of death, suddenly realised that he was yet a puthujjana.  This thought so filled him with anguish that he put forth special effort, and by developing insight became an arahant.[/p][p]Channa had friends and relations in the Vajjian village of Pubbavijjhana (v.l.  Pubbavajira), and came himself from there.  v.l.  Chandaka.[/p][hr][p][b]3. Channa.[/b]-Gotama's charioteer and companion, born on the same day as Gotama (J.i.54; Mtu.ii.156, 164, 189, 233; iii.91, 262; BuA.233; SA.ii.231; DhsA.34. ThagA.  (i.155) says he was the son of a servant woman of Suddhodana).  When Gotama left household life, Channa rode with him on the horse Kanthaka as far as the river Anomā.  There Gotama gave him his ornaments and bade him take Kanthaka back to his father's palace (A thūpa was later erected on the spot where Channa turned back; Dvy.391).  When, however, Kanthaka died of a broken heart, Channa's grief was great, for he had suffered a double loss.  It is said that he begged for leave to join Gotama as a recluse, but this leave was refused (J.i.64f).  He therefore returned to Kapilavatthu, but when the Buddha visited his Sākiyan kinsfolk, Channa joined the Order.  Because of his great affection for the Buddha, however, egotistical pride in "our Buddha, our Doctrine" arose in him and he could not conquer this fondness nor fulfil his duties as a bhikkhu.  (ThagA.i.155; his verse (No.69) quoted in Thag.  does not, however, refer to any such remissness on his part).[/p][p][/p][p]Once, when in the Ghositārāma in Kosambī, Channa committed a fault but was not willing to acknowledge it.  When the matter was reported to the Buddha, he decreed that the ukkhepaniya-kamma be carried out against him, forbidding him to eat or dwell with the Sangha.  He therefore changed his residence, but was everywhere "boycotted," and returned to Kosambī subdued and asking for reprieve, which was granted to him.  Vin.ii.23ff.  His obstinacy and perverseness are again mentioned elsewhere - e.g., Vin.iv.35, 113, 141. A patron of his once erected a vihāra for him, but he so thatched and decked it that it fell down.  In trying to repair it he damaged a brahmin's barley field (Vin.iii.47).  See also Vin.iii.155f., 177.[/p][p]Later, in a dispute between the monks and the nuns, he deliberately sided with the latter; this was considered so perverse and so lacking in proper esprit de corps, that the Buddha decreed on him the carrying out of the Brahmadanda whereby all monks were forbidden to have anything whatsoever to do with him.  This was the last disciplinary act of the Buddha, and the carrying out thereof was entrusted to Ananda.  D.ii.154. It would, however, appear from DhA.ii.110 that the Brahmadanda was inflicted on Channa for his having repeatedly reviled Sāriputta and Moggallāna in spite of the Buddha's warning.  In this version other details also vary.[/p][p][/p][p]When Ananda visited Channa at the Ghositārāma and pronounced on him the penalty, even his proud and independent spirit was tamed; he became humble, his eyes were opened, and dwelling apart, earnest and zealous, he became one of the arahants, upon which the penalty automatically lapsed (Vin.ii.292).  In the past, Channa met Siddhattha Buddha going towards a tree, and being pleased with him, spread for him a soft carpet of leaves round which he spread flowers.  Five kappas ago he became king seven times, under the name of Tinasanthāraka (ThagA.i.155).[/p][p][/p][p]He is probably identical with Senāsanadāyaka of the Apadāna (i.137).[/p][p][/p][p]Channa is identified with the hunter in the Suvannamiga (III.187), the Gijjha (III.332), the Rohantamiga (IV.423), the Cūlahamsa (V.354), and the Mahāhamsa (V.382) Jātakas, with the wrestler in the Sālikedāra Jātaka (IV.282) and with Cetaputta in the Vessantara Jātaka (VI.593).

Jānussoni goes to visit the Buddha and reports his conversation with Pilotika.  The Buddha tells him it would be a mistake to conclude at once from seeing a broad footprint that it belonged to a very large elephant; there are many other possibilities which should first be eliminated.  He then proceeds to describe the life of a real recluse, the disciple of the Noble One, and the attainments he reaches; these he calls the Truth-finder's foot prints.  Following this, the disciple makes further discoveries, till his mind is completely free from the āsavas, and then he realises the Truth-finder's real quest.

  <entry>[div class="huge"]Campeyya Jātaka (No.506)[/div][p]Once the king of Magadha, at constant war with the king of Anga, obtaining the help of the Nāga-king who dwelt in the river Campā, defeated his rival.  Thereafter he held an annual festival in honour of the Nāga-king.  The Bodhisatta, a very poor man, saw Campeyya's splendour on his way to the feast and longed for a like greatness.  As a result, after death, he was born in the Nāga world where he became king under the name of Campeyya.  Realising what had happened, he felt disgust at his position as a Nāga and made many attempts to observe religious vows, hoping, in this way, to gain release.  But he was foiled in his efforts by his consort Sumanā.  At last he came to the world of men, where he kept fast on certain days, lying on an ant-hill.  There he was taken captive by a snake charmer who tortured him in various ways and took him about, exhibiting him for gain.  By certain tokens of which Campeyya had earlier warned her, Sumanā knew that her husband had been taken captive and, after much searching, she discovered him just as the snake charmer was about to give a performance before Uggasena, king of Benares.  The whole story was then revealed, and the snake charmer set Campeyya free.  That Uggasena might be convinced of the truth of the story, he was invited to the Nāga-world, where he and his retinue were lavishly entertained.[/p][p]The story was related in connection with the observance of uposatha vows.

Besides the she-elephant and the slave Kāka, already mentioned, Pajjota had three other fleet-footed conveyances: two mares, Celakanthī and Muñjakesī, both capable of travelling one hundred leagues a day, and an elephant, Nālāgiri, able to go one hundred and twenty leagues a day.  In a past birth Pajjota had been the servitor of a certain chief.  One day, when the chief was returning from the bath, he saw a Pacceka Buddha leaving the city, where he had begged for alms without receiving anything.  The chief hurried home and, finding that his meal was ready, sent it to the Pacceka Buddha by the hand of his fleet-footed servant.  The servant travelled with all possible haste and, having given the meal to the Pacceka Buddha, expressed certain wishes, as the result of which in this birth he gained possession of the five conveyances.  He had authority equal to the power of the sun's rays.  (This may be another explanation of the nickname Canda).

But the Buddha sent Kaccāna and his companions, now become arahants, to preach to the king and establish the Sāsana in Avanti.  The mission was successful.  The Theragāthā contains stanzas uttered by the Thera in admonition to the king.  It is said that the king had faith in the brahmins and held sacrifices involving the slaughter of animals; he was wicked in his deeds.  One night he had a dream which frightened him and went to the Thera to have it explained.  The Thera told him of the necessity for leading a virtuous life.

His colleagues were Isidatta and Mahāsona.  During the time of the peril, he took leave of his colleagues and went to worship at the Mahāvihāra.  He found it empty and started for the south, when the sprite of a neighbouring tree, assuming human form, looked after him and escorted him to a village near the Jajjaranadī, where he was supported by foresters (?pannakhādakamanussā) till the peril was past (VibhA.446).

Around this space were seven girdles of lilies, each girdle of a different hue and each a league in extent.  Round the lake were seven ranges of mountains - Cullakāla, Mahākāla, Udaka, Candapassa, Suriyapassa, Manipassa and Suvannapassa, the last range being seven leagues in height and of a golden hue on the side overlooking the lake.  On the west side of the lake was the Kañcanaguhā, twelve leagues in extent, where the elephant-king lived.  J.v.37.[/p][hr][p][b]3. Chaddanta[/b].-A tribe of elephants, of which tribe the Bodhisatta was once born as king (see No.4).  The Chaddantas and the Uposathas are the two highest classes of elephant (DhA.iii.248).  The Chaddantakula sometimes provides the hatthiratana for a Cakkavatti, in which case it is the youngest of the tribe who so functions (KhpA.172).  Of the ten tribes of elephants enumerated in the books (E.g., UdA.403; VibhA.397) the Chaddanta is classed as the highest, and the Buddha possesses the strength of ten Chaddanta-elephants, each elephant having the strength of ten thousand million men (BuA.37).  These elephants have the power of travelling through the air and are white in hue (J.v.37; Vsm.650).[/p][hr][p][b]4. Chaddanta[/b].-The Bodhisatta, born as king of the elephants of the Chaddanta tribe, eight thousand in number.  His body was pure white, with red face and feet, and seven parts of his body touched the ground.  He lived in the Kañcanaguhā on the banks of the Chaddanta Lake, his chief queens being Cūlasubhaddā and Mahāsubhaddā.  Owing to the preference shown to Mahāsubhaddā by Chaddanta, Cūlasubhaddā conceived a grudge against him, and one day, when Chaddanta was entertaining five hundred Pacceka Buddhas, she offered them wild fruits and made a certain wish.  As a result she was reborn in the Madda king's family and was named Subhaddā.  Later she became chief consort of the king of Benares.  Remembering her ancient grudge, she schemed to have Chaddanta's tusks cut off.  All the hunters were summoned by the king, and Sonuttara was chosen for the task.  It took him seven years, seven months and seven days to reach Chaddanta's dwelling-place.  He dug a pit and covered it, and as the elephant passed over it shot at him a poisoned arrow.  When Chaddanta realised what had happened, he charged Sonuttara, but, seeing that he was clad in a yellow robe, he restrained himself.  Having learnt Sonuttara's story, he showed him how his tusks could be cut off, but Sonuttara's strength was not sufficient to saw them through.  Chaddanta thereupon took the saw with his own trunk and, wounded as he was and suffering excruciating pain from the incisions already made in his jaws, he sawed through the tusks, handed them over to the hunter and died.  In seven days, through the magic power of the elephant's tusks, Sonuttara returned to Benares; but when Subhaddā heard that her conspiracy had resulted in the death of her former lover and husband, she died of a broken heart (J.v.36ff).[/p][p]Chaddanta is mentioned as one of the births in which the Bodhisatta practised sīla-pāramitā (J.i.45).

He was an Anāgāmī, and offered to perform a miracle himself before the Buddha showed the Twin Miracle (DhA.iii.210).  Culla-Anāthapindika provided food for three months for the multitude, covering an area of twelve leagues, which had assembled at Sāvatthi to await the descent of the Buddha from Tāvatimsa after his preaching of the Abhidhamma Pitaka (DhA.iii.218; AA.i.71).  Five hundred monks fed daily at Culla-Anāthapindika's house in Sāvatthi (DhA.i.339).  He was one of the seven lay disciples of the Buddha who had each five hundred followers (SA.iii.223).  Culla-Anāthapindika is generally mentioned (E.g., J.i.148; ii.287, iii.520) together with Pasenadi, Visākhā, and Anāthapindika as the Buddha's eminent lay-patrons.  His personal name is not known.

  <entry>[div class="huge"]Cūlanāga [/div][hr][p]1. Cūlanāga Thera.-Generally referred to as Tipitaka-Cūlanāga.  He was evidently a very famous commentator, and his opinions are quoted in the commentaries of Buddhaghosa.  (E.g., MA.i.126; SA.iii.206; DhsA.229, 267, 284; Vm.389; also FsA.405).  Cūlanāga was the pupil of Summa Thera of Dīpavihāra (AA.ii.845) and a contemporary of Tipitaka-Cūlabhaya Thera, who seems to have differed from him most violently on certain points (See VihhA.16; also DhsA.230).  Cūlanāga lived in the reign of Kutakanna-Tissa (16-38 A.C.), and we are told (VibhA.452) that the king held him in great respect.  Once the Elder had a boil on his finger, and the king, visiting him, put the finger in his mouth to alleviate the pain.  The boil burst and the king swallowed the pus therefrom.  When the Elder lay dying the king carried on his head the pot containing his stools, lamenting, "The mainstay of the Dhamma is lost." The Samyutta Commentary (SA.ii.201) tells of an incident which occurred when Cūlanāga was preaching in the Lohapāsāda.  A brahmin, listening to him, was so convinced by the sermon of the impermanence of all things, that he ran home and clasped his son to his heart, saying that he was undone.  The Elder once received a bowl which it was not right for him to keep and he gave it to the Sangha (Sp.iii.699).  Cūlanāga does not always seem to have agreed with his teacher in his interpretations of various matters (VibhA.342).  Once when it was announced to Summa that Cūlanāga had explained the word thūpīkata in a certain way, he expressed great sorrow and resentment and declared that though he had seven times read the Vinaya with Cūlanāga, he had never taught him such an explanation; but Cūlanāga was able to uphold his contention (Sp.iv.892; for another incident see Cūla-Summa).  Cūlanāga once preached the Chachakka Sutta in Ambilahāla Vihāra, and on that occasion the audience of men extended to a distance of one gāvuta and that of devas to a distance of a league.  At the end of the discourse, one thousand monks became arahants (MA.ii.1025).[/p][p][/p][p]2. Cūlanāga.-A Thera of Vasālanagara.  With his brother Mahānāga, he entered the Order and, for thirty years, lived in Cittalapabbata, where he attained arahantship.  He refused to reveal his identity to his mother when visiting her because he did not wish to have any attachments.  SA.ii.125.[/p][p][/p][p]3. Cūlanāga.-A Thera of Ceylon.  An eminent teacher of the Vinaya.  Vin.v.3; Sp.i.62.[/p][p][/p][p]4. Cūlanāga.-A monk of Pidhānagalla in the time of Dutthagāmanī.  Sanghadattā (q.v.) gave him a robe.[/p][p][/p][p]5. Cūlanāga.-A monk of Asiggāhaka-parivena.  One day, after having obtained alms in Candavankavīthi, he fed a starving bitch.  That same evening he got large quantities of ghee and molasses which he gave to his colleagues.  For thirty two years he gave alms to thousands of monks from food given to him by the people of Candavankavīthi.  Later, he became an arahant.  Once, 500 monks on pilgrimage to the Bodhi-tree, took him with them to avert danger.  In four months they reached Kottapattana and in seven months the Bodhi-tree, being well entertained everywhere.  On the way back Cūlanāga was seized with a colic and died; but before death he advised his colleagues to cremate his body and take his ashes that they might be provided with their wants.

  <entry>[div class="huge"]Cetiyapabbata[/div][p]Also called Cetiyagiri.  The later name of the Missaka mountain given on account of its many shrines.  Devānampiyatissa built a vihāra there - the second vihāra in Ceylon - for Mahinda and those ordained under him (Mhv.xvi.12-17).  The relics, obtained by Sumanasāmanera from Asoka and from Sakka, were deposited there until they were needed.  According to the Mahāvamsa (Mhv.xxii.23ff) this fact was the occasion for the name.  One of the eight saplings of the Sacred Bodhi-tree at Anurādhapura was planted in the drama on Cetiyagiri (Mhv.xix.62).  Mahinda spent the last years of his life on Cetiyagiri and died there, and there his relics were enshrined (Mhv.xx.32, 45).  Near the mountain was the village of Dvāramandala (Mhv.xxiii.23).  Kutakannatissa built an uposatha-hall on the mountain and planted a Bodhi-tree, while Bhāti-kābhaya supplied food daily to one thousand monks dwelling there (Mhv.xxxiv.30f, 64), and Lañjakatissa had the vihāra paved at a cost of one hundred thousand (Mhv.xxxiii.25).  Mahādāthikamahānāga made four gateways and a road round the mountain, and held the Giribhandapūjā with great pomp and ceremony; it is said that in order that the people might approach the mountain with clean feet he spread carpets right up to it from the Kadamba River (Mhv.xxxiv.75ff).  Kanirajānutissa had sixty monks of Cetiyapabbata put to death as traitors by flinging them into the cave called Kanira (Mhv.xxxv.11).  Vasabha provided four thousand lamps to be lighted on Cetiyagiri (Mhv.xxxv.80), while Jetthatissa gave to the vihāra the income derived from the Kālamattika Tank.  (Mhv.xxxvi.130; see also Dpv.xv.69; xvii.90; xix.13, and Sp.i.82ff).[/p][p]In the time of Kakusandha, Cetiyagiri was known as Devakūta, in that of Konāgamana as Suvannakūta, and in that of Kassapa as Subhakūta (Sp.i.86f).  The Dhammarucikas once occupied the Ambatthalavihāra on Cetiyapabbata, it having been given to them by Dhātusena (Cv.xxxviii.75).  Aggabodhi supplied a permanent supply of water for the bathing-tank called Nāgasondi, on the top of Cetiyagiri (Cv.xlii.28; see Cv.  Trs.i.68, n.8), while Aggabodhi III.  gave to the vihāra the village of Ambillapadara (Cv.xliv.122).  Aggabodhi V.  restored the ruined buildings of Cetiyapabbata at a cost of one hundred and twenty thousand pieces (Cv.xlviii.7), while the queen of Udaya I, built there the Kanthakacetiya, and her husband decorated the mountain with brightly coloured flags and streamers (Cv.xlix.23, 27).  Sena I, gave to the monastery the income from the Kānavāpi (Cv.l.72), and Sena II.  Provided a hospital for the use of the monks there (Cv.li.73).  Kassapa VI.  built the Hadayunha Parivena and gifted it to the Dhammarucikas (Cv.lii.18).  Parakkamabāhu I restored all the old buildings which had been destroyed and built sixty-four thūpas (Cv.lxxviii.108).[/p][p]The Commentaries relate several anecdotes connected with Cetiyapabbata.  Maliyadeva Thera recited there the Chachakka Sutta, and sixty listening bhikkhus became arahants (MA.ii.1064).  Lomasanāga Theca lived in the Padhānaghara in the Piyanguguhā there and overcame the cold he felt by meditating on the Lokantarikaniraya (MA.i.65).  Cetiyapabbata was the residence of Kālabuddharakkhita, and King Saddhātissa spent some time there (MA.i.469f.  See also Vsm.20, 64; DhSA.194, 200; AA.i.44).  At the time that Fa Hsien came to Ceylon there were two thousand monks in Cetiyagiri, including a monk of great fame, called Dharmagupta (Giles: p.72).[/p][hr]</entry>

  <entry>[div class="huge"]Cullapindapātiya(°pātika)-Tissa[/div][p]A monk mentioned in the Commentaries (E.g., MA.i.355) in explaining the term mutta-muttaka.  A certain lay-woman waited on him for twelve years.  One day a fire broke out in the village and burnt her house, together with those of others.  The monks who were fed at neighbouring houses went there to enquire whether anything had been served, but Tissa did not arrive until the mealtime, and when given a meal which the woman had prepared with great difficulty, ate it and went away without a word.  The woman, however, was not a whit disturbed by the taunts of her neighbours.[/p][p]This may be the Elder who, in the Anguttara Commentary (AA.i.21f), is mentioned as having resided in Gāmendavālavihāra in Rohana and ordained Milakkha-Tissa.  The same Commentary (i.367) mentions a Cullapindapātiya-Tissa of Girivihāra in (Ceylon).  He, with his divine eye, saw a Tamil gate-keeper of Madhuanganagāma who, having been a fisherman for fifty years, lay dying.  The Elder went to his house and made him repeat the Refuges and the Precepts.  The man could not repeat beyond the first Precept, but he was born after death in the Cātummahārājika-world, and came to tell the Elder about it.[/p][p]The Visuddhi Magga (p.116) speaks of an Elder of the same name who had three pupils.  They came to him and said they were prepared to do anything whatever for his sake, even to suffer torture and die.  He thought them "possible fellows" and preached to them, whereupon they became arahants.  The same Elder it may be who saw an elephant-corpse in Kāladīghavāpi Lake and developed his meditation on the "wormful abomination (Ibid., p.191).[/p][hr]</entry>

  <entry>[div class="huge"]Cūla-Rahulovāda Sutta[/div][p]The Buddha realises that Rāhula is possessed of the qualities necessary to Deliverance and goes with him to Andhavana for the siesta.  There the Buddha demonstrates, by means of question and answer, that all things are impermanent, and impresses on Rāhula the manner in which the disciples of the Ariyans should strive to be delivered from them.  Rāhula takes the lesson to heart, and even as it is being delivered attains to arahantship.  (M.iii.277f; this sutta is also found at S.iv.105ff, where it is called the Rāhula Sutta).  [/p][p][/p][p]Many thousands of devas are present at the preaching of the sermon, and this sutta is therefore given as an illustration of the Buddha's great compassion (E.g., UdA.324; MA.i320; also Mil.20).  Among the suttas specially preached to Rāhula, this one emphasises vipassanā (AA.ii.547).

Cakkana was sent by his brother into the field, where he caught a hare which, however, out of compassion he set free.  His brother blamed him, but Cakkana cured his mother by a saccakiriyā, saying that, inasmuch as he had never deprived anything of life, by the power of that truth his mother should recover.  (SA.ii.112; the story is slightly different in MA.i.165).

Assaka, king of Potali, with the advice of his minister Nandisena, accepted the challenge.  Kālinga thereupon came with his mighty army, and the Bodhisattva who was an ascetic declared, after consultation with Sakka, that victory would be his.  But Nandisena, undaunted, instructed Assaka as to how he should kill the tutelary deity of Kālinga when this deity, in the guise of a white bull, should appear on the battlefield.  Nandisena led the attack of the soldiers, the white bull was killed and Kālinga defeated.  He had to provide dowries for his daughters, and thenceforth the two kings lived as friends.[/p][p][/p][p]The story was related in reference to Sāriputta who is identified with Nandisena.  Two Jains, a man and a woman, each versed in five hundred theses, met in Vesāli and the Licchavis arranged a marriage between them.  They had one son, Saccaka, and four daughters, Saccā, Lolā, Avavādakā and Patācārā.  After the death of their parents, the girls wandered from city to city for purposes of disputation.  They came at last to Sāvatthi, where they set up at the city gate a jambu-tree, to be pulled up by anyone accepting their challenge to a discussion.  Sāriputta, seeing the branch, had it removed, and when the girls came to him with a great crowd of people, answered all their questions and defeated them in debate.  There-upon they entered the Order under Uppalavannā, and the fame of Sāriputta increased.  J.iii.1ff[/p][hr]</entry>

  <entry>[div class="huge"]Cūlasumma[/div][p]An eminent Commentator of Ceylon, teacher of Tipitaka Cūlanāga.  The pupil seems to have disagreed with some of the explanations of his teacher - e.g., as to the meaning of ekāyanamagga.  Cūlanāga said it referred to pubbabhāgasatipatthānamagga, but Cūlasumma held that it referred to missakamagga.  They could come to no decision; but while on his way to the bathing-place, Cūlasumma revolved the problem in his mind, and discovering that his pupil was right announced his mistake when Cūlanāga was preaching on the day of the first quarter.  Cūlanāga, realising how even his teacher could go astray on this point, explained it at great length for the benefit of future generations (DA.iii.744f.; MA.i.187).  The Anguttara Commentary (AA.ii.845) calls him Dīpavihāravāsī, while the Vibhanga Commentary (p.489; probably Cūlasumma is here a misreading for Cūlasumana) says that he dwelt in Ninkaponnapadhānaghara in Cittalapabbata.

Sambhūta heard the stanza, remembered his brother, and, after inquiry, visited Citta, who had then gone to the royal park.  There Citta gave him counsel, and not long after Sambhūta renounced the world.  After death they were both born in the Brahma world.[/p][p]Ananda is identified with Sambhūta.

When asked why he had not so behaved on the previous occasion, Chattapāni replied that such an action would have been discourteous to the Buddha.  Thereupon Pasenadi asked him to act as instructor in the Dhamma to the women of the palace, but he refused the invitation, deeming that such a course would be unseemly and unwise.  The task was therefore given to Ananda.  DhA.i.380f; cp.  Vin.iv.157. The story is also found in J.i.381f, with several variations in detail.

In one of his previous lives he was a king whose queen carried on intrigues with sixty-four of the slaves.  Having failed to tempt the Bodhisatta, she spoke calumny against him and had him put in prison.  But he explained the matter to the king and was released.  From that time the king gave up envy.

It was fast-day, and as there was no meat in the town the cook sought the queen's advice.  When the king sat down to eat, his small son, whom he much loved, was brought to him in the hope that he might forget to ask for meat.  But the plan failed, and in his drunkenness he twisted his son's neck and had his flesh cooked for him to eat.

On its banks was a grove of campaka-trees, well known for the fragrance of their marvellous white flowers, and there, in the Buddha's time, wandering teachers were wont to lodge.  The Buddha himself stayed thereon several occasions (Vin.i.312; S.i.195; A.iv.59, 168; v.151, 189).  Sāriputta (A.iv.59) and Vangīsa (S.i.195) are also said to have stayed there.

It lay at a distance of sixty yojanas from Mithilā (J.iv.32).  In the Buddha's time the people of Campā owed allegiance to Bimbisāra, as king of Magadha, and Bimbisāra had given a royal fief in Campā to the brahmin Sonadanda (D.i.111).  Campā was evidently an important centre of trade, and we are told that merchants travelled from there to Suvannabhūmi for purposes of trade (E.g., J.vi.539).

But the legends connected with them are so confused that it is not possible to differentiate clearly one from the other.  [/p][p]Mention is also made of a [b]Cunda-Samanuddesa[/b] whom, however, the Commentaries (E.g..  DA.iii.907) identify with Mahā-Cunda.  Mahā-Cunda is, for instance, described in the Theragāthā Commentary (ThagA.i.261; see also DhA.ii.188 and AA.ii.674) as the younger brother of  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/saariputta,Sāriputta')"]Sāriputta[/a], under whom he joined the Order, winning arahantship after arduous and strenuous effort.  [/p][p]In the time of  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/vipassii,Vipassī')"]Vipassī[/a] Buddha he had been a potter and had given to the Buddha a bowl made of clay.  The Apadāna verses quoted in the Theragāthā Commentary are, in the Apadāna itself (Ap.ii.444), ascribed to a monk named [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/e/ekapattadaayaka_th,Ekapattadāyaka')"]Ekapattadāyaka[/a].  They make no mention whatever of his relationship to Sāriputta.  On the other hand, there are to be found elsewhere in the Apadāna (Ap.i.101f) certain verses ascribed to a Cunda Thera, which definitely state that he was the son of the brahmin [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/va/vanganta,Vanganta')"]Vanganta[/a], and that his mother was  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/r/rupasari,Sārī')"]Sārī[/a].  But in these verses he is called Cūla-Cunda, and mention is made of his previous birth in the time of  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/siddhattha,Siddhattha')"]Siddhattha[/a] Buddha, to whom he gave a bouquet of jasmine flowers.  As a result he became king of the devas seventy-seven times and was once king of men, by name Dujjaya.  It is further stated that he became arahant while yet a sāmanera and that he waited upon the Buddha and his own brother and other virtuous monks.  This account goes on to say that after his brother's death, Cunda brought his relics in a bowl and presented them to the Buddha, who uttered praises of Sāriputta.  This would identify Cūla-Cunda with Cunda Samanuddesa who, according to the Samyutta Nikāya (S.v.161f), attended Sāriputta in his last illness and, after his death, brought to the Buddha at  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/j/jetavana,Jetavana')"]Jetavana[/a] Sāriputta's bowl and outer robe and his relics wrapt in his water-strainer.  Therefore if Buddhaghosa is correct in identifying Cunda Samanuddesa with Mahā-Cunda, then all three are one and the same.  (Buddhaghosa says that the monks called him Samanuddesa in his youth before his upasampadā, and he never lost the name, DA.iii.907).[/p][p]Cunda Samanuddesa was, for some time, the personal attendant of the  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddha,Buddha')"]Buddha[/a] (ThagA.ii.124; J.iv.95, etc.), and when the Buddha prepared to perform the Twin Miracle, offered to perform a miracle himself and so save the Buddha trouble and exertion (DhA.iii.211).

He had a prodigious memory.  Once he shut three of the gates of Anurādhapura, allowing only one door for the use of those leaving the city.  As each person went out he asked his name, and each of these names he was able to repeat when the owner returned in the evening to the city (DA.ii.530).  He was a contemporary of Cūlanāga (DhsA.230; SA.iii.206), with whom he held discussions.  His description (given at the Lohapāsāda) (DA.ii.442) of the details connected with the first words uttered by the Buddha after his birth, and the manner in which he walked, is accepted as authentic.

So he went to the Buddha, heard him preach, and, having entered the Order, attained arahantship (Thag.vs.77; ThagA.i.170f).[/p][p]In the time of Vipassī Buddha he was a householder.  Having seen the Buddha, he offered him flowers and paid him homage.  Forty one kappas ago he was a king, named Varana.  He is probably identical with Ganthipupphiya Thera of the Apadāna.

  <entry>[div class="huge"]1. Hamsa Jātaka (No.  502)[/div][p]Once Khemā, wife of King Bahuputtaka of  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/baranasi,Benares')"]Benares[/a], dreamed of a golden goose preaching the Law and craved for her dream to come true.  The king had a lake, called Khemā, dug outside the city, and put into it various kinds of food in order to entice the golden geese which lived in Cittakūta.  They came, led by Dhatarattha the Bodhisatta, who was caught in the snare laid by the king's hunter.  The Bodhisatta gave the alarm, and all the geese fled except Sumukha, his captain, who refused to leave him even though told to do so.  When the hunter came, Sumukha persuaded him to let Dhatarattha free and to take him instead.  The hunter agreed, but when the Bodhisatta heard of the reason for his capture, he, too, insisted on going before the king.  Both geese were, therefore, led before the king, who was overjoyed.  Dhatarattha preached the Law and the queen's craving was appeased; the geese were then allowed to fly away.[/p][p]The story was related in reference to Ananda's readiness to give his life for the Buddha.  Channa is identified with the huntsman, Sāriputta with the king, Khemā Therī with the queen, and Ananda with Sumukha.  J.iv.423-30; cf.  the Mahāhamsa Jātaka.[/p][hr]</entry>
  <entry>[div class="huge"]2. Hatthaka[/div][p]A monk.  He was a Sākyan and loved holding discussions with the heretics.  When he suffered defeat at their hands, he would resort to falsehood and evasion, or would ask his opponent to and meet him somewhere and then go there before the appointed time and give it out that his opponent had avoided him.  This matter was reported to the Buddha, who rebuked Hatthaka for his conduct.  Vin.iv.1f.; cf.  DhA.iii.390.[/p][hr]</entry>
  <entry>[div class="huge"]Hatthipāla Jātaka (No.  509)[/div][p]Esukārī, king of  [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/baranasi,Benares')"]Benares[/a], had no sons.  His chaplain, hearing that the deity of a certain banyan tree had the power of giving sons, went to the tree and threatened to cut it down unless Esukārī had a son.  The tree deity consulted Sakka, who persuaded four devas to be born as the sons, not of Esukārī, but of his chaplain.  On the day when the chaplain came to cut down the tree, the deity told him of Sakka's decision, and also warned him that the sons would not live the household life.  In due course the sons were born and were named Hatthipāla, Gopāla, Assapāla and Ajapāla.  Various devices were adopted to prevent them from turning to the ascetic life.  But when Hatthipāla grew up he insisted on leaving home and becoming an ascetic, heedless of the entreaties both of his father and of Esukārī.  His brothers, when their time came, acted in the same way.  Later, their parents joined them.  The king sent for all their wealth, but the queen, being wise, made him realize by means of a simile the folly of such an act.  Together they left the world and joined Hatthipāla and his family.  The citizens followed their example till the whole city was empty.[/p][p]Hatthipāla preached to them and they all became ascetics.  His company covered an area of thirty leagues, and with it he went to the Himālaya, where Vissakamma, acting under Sakka's orders, built for them a hermitage extending over thirty six leagues, on the bank's of the Ganges.  Soon after, other kings who, with their followers, had gone, one after another, to take Benares, realizing their folly, joined Hatthipāla and became ascetics.[/p][p]The story was related in reference to the Buddha's Great Renunciation.  Suddhodana was Esukārī, Mahāmāyā his queen, Kassapa the chaplain, Bhaddā Kapilānī his wife, Anuruddha Ajapāla, Moggallāna Gopāla, Sāriputta Assapāla and the Buddha himself Hatthipāla.[/p][p]The large concourse that followed Hatthipāla is called Hatthipālasamāgama, and in it were several who later attained arahantship in Ceylon - Phussadeva of Katakandharakara, Mahāsangharakkhita of Uparimandalakamalaya, Maliyamahādeva, Mahādeva of Bhaggagiri, Mahāsīva of Vimantapabbhāra, and Mahānāga of Kālavallimandapa (J.iv.473-91; referred to at J.i.45).  A Burmese monk of Ava, Ratthasāra by name, born in 1468, composed a metrical version of the Hatthipāla Jātaka.  Bode, op.  cit., 44.[/p][hr]</entry>
  <entry>[div class="huge"]HSUAN TSANG (var.  Hiuen Tsiang)[/div][p]A well known Chinese monk who visited India and traversed a large number of countries covering more than 50,000 Li.  Though the dangers that he encountered were many he fulfilled his main objective undaunted by them.  His contribution to the cause of Buddhism in general and to the Great Vehicle in particular is immense.  For these and many other reasons he is held by the Chinese Buddhists in the highest esteem among the pilgrims of his calibre.[/p][p]The following information on Hsūan-tsang's travels and his accounts of India and other countries which he travelled in his long journey is based mainly on two sources, namely, "Si-yu-ki, Buddhist Records of the Western World" an English translation of the Chinese version of Hsūan-tsang and "The Life of Hiuen-tsiang" an English translation of his biography written in Chinese by Shaman Hwui-li, a disciple of his.  Among secondary sources the most useful treatise is 'On Yuan Chwang's Travels in India', a critical study written by Thomas Watters in 1961. This work is based on Hsūan-tsang's Hsi-Yu-Shi (or Si-Yu-Ki) also entitled Buddhist Records of the Western World.[/p][p]Hsūan-tsang was born in 603 A.C.  in Chin-lu in the reign of Emperor Wen of the Sui dynasty and lived about sixty-five years.  Opinions, however, differ regarding the exact years of his birth and death.  His secular name was Ch'en-Chin and he was the youngest of four brothers.  His father was Ch'en-hui who devoted himself to the study of Confucious' teachings.  Even as a child Hsūan-tsang was unusually of grave temperament and intelligence.  He did not enjoy the company of boys of his age nor did he appreciate their life style.  His second brother, Chang-tse who had entered the Order previously took Hsūan-tsang to his own convent and made arrangements to impart instruction to him there.[/p][p]Hsūan-tsang (= Ht.) was so studious that at times he studied without sleep and even food.  At one hearing he is said to have comprehended a book thoroughly and after a second reading needed no further instruction.  At the age of eleven he was versed in the Saddharmapundarika Sutra and the Vimalakirtinirdesa.  At the age of thirteen he was admitted into the Order and was engaged in further studies.[/p][p]The political situation in the country being unsatisfactory the two brothers went to Chang'an and from there again to Ch'eng-tu, the capital of Shu.  There Hsūan-tsang followed lectures on the scriptures delivered by eminent scholars and in a few years he mastered the scriptures of various schools and earned a name as a scholar.  It was about this time or a few years later that he came to be known by the appellation "The Master of the Law".[/p][p]In the fifth year of Wu-te he received full ordination at Ch'eng-tu.  He went to Chin-chow for further studies where he also conducted sermons as an advanced student.  Scholar monks who gathered there as listeners treated him with great respect and admiration.  Thereupon he went to Chaochow, Hsiang-chow and Ch'ang-an and studied the Samyuktābhidharma-hrdaya, the Mahāyāna-sangraha, the Abhidharma-kosa etc.[/p][p]In a short time Ht.  mastered all the theories of the different schools of Buddhism and was acclaimed as a great scholar.  He found that Buddhist teachings he had learned, mainly those concerned with the theory of Dharmalaksana and the views held by the propounders of the Mahāyāna-Sangraha and those held by the followers of the Dasabhūmivyākarana were at variance.  Moreover, he discerned many defects in the Chinese translations of the sacred books, and consequently he cherished the idea of going to India to learn at the feet of orthodox scholars.  In this he was inspired to some extent by his forerunners Fa-hsien and Chi-yen who undertook similar tasks.[/p][p]Overcoming many obstacles Ht., at the age of twenty-six years set forth from Chang-an and going through several provinces or countries came to Liang-chow where he received a companion to travel to the West.  Despite the attempts of spies to detain him the governor of the province, Li-chiang, however, let him proceed on his journey.  Some of the territories or countries which he traversed until he reached the borders of North India were Turfan (Kau-chang), Agni (O-ki-ni), Kuche (Kiuchi) an oasis in the Gobi desert, Nujkend (Nu-chin-kien), Chaf (Che-shi), Ferghanah (Fei-han in Turkestan), Sutrishna (Su-tu-Ii-sse-na), Samarkhand (Sa-mo-kien), Kesh (Ki-shwang-na), Kunduz (Hwo), Bhaktra or Bactria (Fo-ho-lo), Bamiyam (Fan-yen-na) and Kapisa (Kia-pi-she).[/p][p]His journey was beset with dangers and hardships.  As the only guide given him to accompany until the last of the watch towers in sandy desert also deserted him he went on all alone.  The worst experience encountered was in the heart of the Mo-kia-yen desert which extended for 800 li.  One hundred li after entering the desert he lost his way.  By accident his water bag gave way without leaving a drop of water in it and he had to spend four nights and five days in the desert without water.[/p][p]At a later stage when wending their way up the snow-clad Ling mountain, and the snowy mountain (Hindukush) lying to the south of Balkh, twelve or fourteen of his companions and an even greater number of oxen and horses met with death.[/p][p]Obstacles caused by robbers on his way to India and also in India itself were more than embarrassing.  Even governors or kings of certain countries embarrassed him as he was proceeding towards India.  Although very hospitable and respectful to Ht.  the king of Kam-chang, Khio-wen-tai planned to detain him in his court as his spiritual head.  Ht.  got out of this grip only by the threat of fasting unto death.  Another attempt to detain him was made by the Great Khan of the Turks.  As will appear below, Ht.  underwent another such experience in Eastern India as well.[/p][p]Of the countries which were traversed by Ht.  on his way to North India, Bhaktra (Po-ho-lo), Bamiyan (Fanyen-na) and Kapisa (Kia-pi-she) were active centres of Buddhism.  According to Ht, there were about three thousand monks of the Little Vehicle in Bhaktra.  There was a scholar monk called Prajñākara who was versed in the three pitakas of the Little Vehicle.  Ht.  was pleased with his explanation of the doctrine of that school.[/p][p]Ht.  reached Bamiyan crossing Hindu-kush.  In both Bamiyan and Kapisa, there were several thousand monks of the Little Vehicle.  In Bamiyan there were three imposing figures of the Buddha.  One of these was a standing figure of about 140 or 150 feet high.  Another figure of the standing Buddha measures 100 feet in height.  An enormous figure of the recumbent Buddha depicting his 'Nirvana' measures 1000 feet in length.[/p][p]At a conference held in a temple of the Great Vehicle in Kapisa Ht.  being thorough with the teachings of both schools, proved his superiority over all who participated in it.  From Kapisa onwards his itinerary covered territories in North India of which the following place names are graphed by Ht.  into a separate unit.  Lamghan (Lanpo), Nagarahara (Na-kie-to-ho), Gandhara (Kien-to-lo), Udyana (U-chang), Takshasila (Ta-ch'a-shi-lo), Urasa (Wu-la-sa), Kashmir (Kia-shi-mi-lo), Punach (Pun-nuh-t'so) and Rajapuri (Ho-lo-she-pu-lo).  According to Ht, common people in the above territories differ to some extent from those of India in respect of manners, clothing and language.[/p][p]Si-yu-ki, Buddhist Records of the Western World (Records) ed.  Samuel Beal, New Delhi, 1981, Bk.  II, pp.  68, 917; The Life of Hiuen Tsiang (=The Life) ed.  Samuel Beal, New Delhi, 1973, pp.  57-72. The countries from Lamgham to Rajapuri both inclusive were not regarded by the people of India proper as forming parts of their territory (Watters, Thomas, On Yuang Chwang's Travels in India, pub.  Munshi Ram Manohar Lal, Oriental Publishers and Booksellers, Delhi, 1961, p.  180, (Abbreviated as Watters).[/p][p]Nagarahara (Jelalabad) occupies a prominent place as a country possessing Buddha's relics.  In Nagarahara or its neighbourhood Ht.  rejoined his companions and went to Gandhara by the Khyber Pass.  He gives the names of a number of sages and saints who composed sāstras there.  Then he goes to describe the famous stupa of 400 feet in height ascribed to king Kanishka.  It was situated in Purushapura (Po-lu-shu-po-lo), the capital of Gandhara.[/p][p]Either side of the river Subhavastu (Su-po-fa-sa-tu) in the country of Udyana is said by Ht.  to have been thickly populated by Buddhists in former days.  At the time of his visit he saw the country depopulated.  The few monks who were there at the time belonged to five different schools viz.  the Dharmaguptas, the Mahisāsakas, the Kasyapiyas, the Sarvāstivadins and the Mahāsanghikas.  Among the objects of worship are mentioned figures of Avalokitesvara and Maitreya bodhisattva.[/p][p]In Takshasila, Urasa and Kashmir, too, he saw various Buddhist sites.  The chief monk in Kashmir was of high moral character and of remarkable intelligence.  This monk explained many parts of the doctrine to him.  This learned teacher was so impressed by Ht.  that the latter was compared to Asanga bodhisattva in respect of his wisdom.  According to Ht. [a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kaniska,Kanishka')"]Kanishka[/a], convened an assembly, known to history as the Fourth Council, in the four hundredth year from the 'Nirvana' of the Tathāgata.  Ht.  stayed for two years studying sutras and sāstras.[/p][p]Leaving Kashmir Ht.  made his way to Punach and from there to Rajapuri.  From Rajapuri he entered a different zone in North India arriving at Takka (Teheka) as its starting point.  To the east of the town called Narasimha (Na-lo-sang-ho) he and the accompanying sāmaneras encountered a band of fifty robbers who robbed them of their belongings.  However, a brahmin in the neighbourhood came to their help and they managed to escape with no loss of life.  There he remained for one month, and for fourteen months in the kingdom of Chinapati (Chi-na-po-tai) studying various texts.[/p][p]Before reaching the next important kingdom, Mathura (Mo-t'u-lo) he passed through the kingdoms of Jalandhara (She-lan-t'o-lo), Kuluta (Kiu-la-ta), Satadra (Shete-to-lu) and Paryatra (Po-li-ye-to-to).  An interesting custom of making offerings in honour of the disciples of the Buddha is said to have prevailed in Mathura.  The followers of Abhidhamma made offerings in honour of Sāriputta, those who practised meditation.......  in honour of Maudgalyāyana, the students of the sutras......  in honour of Purnamaitrāyaniputra, the followers of the Vinaya.....  in honour of Upāli, the bhikkhunis.....  in honour of Ananda, the Srāmaneras....  in honour of Rāhula and followers of the Great Vehicle....  in honour of bodhisattvas (Watters, pp.  302, 303; The Life, p.  77).[/p][p]After Mathura he visited Matipuram (Ma-ti-pu-lo) which was ruled by a king of the Sūdra caste.  He makes reference to Gunaprabha the author of Tattvavibhanga Sāstra and to a learned doctor called Sanghabbadra who was versed in the Vibhāsā of the Sarvistivāda school and who composed the Kosa-kārikā.  Ht.  stayed there for a few months and studied various texts under the eminent monk called Mitrasena.[/p][p]On his way to Kapitha (Kis-pi-tha) also called Sankassa he had to go past Brahmapura (P'o-lo-hih-mo-pu-lo), Ahikshetra ('O-hi-shi-to-lo) and Virāsana (Pi-to-shanna).  Proceeding two hundred li towards north-west from Kapitha he reached Kanauj or Kānyakubja (Kie-jo-kio-she-kwo).  Its capital borders on the Ganges on the West.  [/p][p]Watters argues that the direction shown in the text is wrong and it should be South East.  He also argues that the river in question is not the Ganges but a tributary of that river (Waiters, p.  340; cp.  also Records, Bk.  V.  p.  207.[/p][p][/p][p]It was a busy centre of Buddhism and there were ten thousand monks who studied both vehicles very ardently.  His account on Harsavardhana or Harsha also called Silāditya is of immense historical value.[/p][p]Countries from Ayodhyā (O-yo-t'o) to Hiranya parvata (I-lam-na-po-fa-to) constitute another phase of his long pilgrimage.  Six hundred li to the south-east from Kanauj is Ayodhya.  Several thousand monks there studied both vehicles, and it is here that Vasubandhu and Asanga carried out their literary activities.  When Ht.  and his companions were going from Ayodhya to Hayamukha ('O-ye-mu-khi) along the course of the Ganges a gang of pirates took the crew captive.  As worshippers of goddess Durga the pirates were looking out for a man of good form and comely features for sacrificing to the goddess.  They earmarked Ht.  as the most suitable person for the purpose and were about to kill him.  Suddenly a typhoon arose smiting down the trees.  Clouds of sand flew on every side and the lashing waves of the river tossed the boats to and fro.  The pirates getting terrified at the calamity thought that it all happened due to the spiritual power of Ht, and came down in repentance and confessed their fault.[/p][p]After this nasty experience Ht.  went to Hayamukha and from there to Prayāga (Po-lo-ye-kia).  He describes Prayāga, the confluence of two rivers, Gangā and Yamunā and the level ground of about fourteen li in circuit, to the West.  From Prayāga he set out for Kausambi (Kiau-shang-mi) where he saw many sanghāramas, stūpas and a sandalwood image of the Buddha fashioned by king Udayana.  According to Ht, there were about three thousand monks belonging to the Sammitiya school of the Little Vehicle in the Kingdom of Visākha (Pi-so-kia).[/p][p]In Srāvasti, the next important Buddhist centre he visited, there were several hundred sanghārāmas belonging to the Sammitiya school.  Sites connected with various incidents are described: for instance, the spot on which Angulimāla gave up his evil acts and was converted, the convent where Brahmacāri heretics killed a woman and accused the Buddha of her murder, the venue in which the Buddha defeated all the heretics, the place where the Buddha met his father, king Suddhodana, for the first time since Enlightenment and so on.[/p][p]From Srāvasti he went to Kapilavastu (Kie-pi-lo-fa-sutu) where the capital as well as some thousand villages were in a state of ruin.  There he saw old foundations of the main palace of Suddhodana and the sleeping quarters of Queen Māyā etc.  Hsūan-tsang's account of Kapilavastu and Kusinagara (Kushi-na-kie-lo) or Kusinārā is replete with accounts of the life of the Buddha before and after his Enlightenment, for example the place of his birth, prophetic pronouncement, sites of the Four Signs, Parinirvāna etc.  According to Ht.  the contemporary tradition has it that the Buddha's Nirvina' took place on the fifteenth day of the latter half of the month of Vaisākha.  The Sarvāstivādins held that it took place during the second half of the month of Kārtika i.e.  November.[/p][p]Referring to the kingdom of Banaras or Bārānasi (Po-lo-ni-sse) he speaks of two schools of monks, one belonging to the Sarvāstivāda and the other to the Sammitiya school both belonging to the Little Vehicle.  Important sites such as the venue of the Buddha's first sermon and his washing tank are mentioned in his account.[/p][p]From Bārānasi he went to Ghazipur (Chen-chu) and then to Vaisāli.  There the capital city was in a state of devastation and ruin.  The inhabitants at the time of his visit were very few in number.  In a sanghārāma there the Buddha is said to have recited the Vimalakirti Sutra.  Three important places relating to his Parinirvana are also mentioned.[/p][p]On his way to Magadha (Mo-kie-to) he stopped at the town of Svetapura where he obtained the sūtra called the Bodhisattva-pitaka.  He had a high esteem for the people of Magadha.  According to him there were about ten thousand monks mostly belonging to the Great Vehicle in Magadha.  The capital of Magadha was desolate and in ruins.  According to Ht.  Asoka held a convocation of a thousand monks at a monastery called Kukkutārāma.  This is an allusion to the Third Council held under the patronage of King Asoka.  The monastery in question is named as Asokārāma in the Dipavamsa and the Mahāvamsa, the two ancient Pali chronicles of Sri Lanka.[/p][p]Referring to Nairañjāna and other important sites at Bodhgayā he mentions various beliefs regarding the Vajrāsana.  One such belief holds that the site of the Vajrāsana was the centre of the universe.  He says that the Bo-tree had been continually cut down and destroyed by the members of the royalty.  Elsewhere he refers to one king named Sasānka of Karnasuvarna in Eastern India who destroyed the Bo-tree (Records Bk.  viii, p.  121).  The following account of Ht.  regarding the Bo-tree seems interesting in respect of rituals which developed in later times.  "The Bo-tree sheds its leaves when the day of the Nirvana approaches and tender leaves begin to grow after this day.  Every year on that day kings, ministers and magistrates pour milk on its roots, light lamps, scatter flowers and they go away collecting leaves.[/p][p]The account on the Nālandā monastery gives some idea about its academic activities, maintenance, academic staff and student population, curriculum and residential quarters.  It says that after the "Nirvana" of the Buddha an old king of that country called Sakrāditya built this convent out of his great attachment for the Buddha.  By the time of Ht.'s visit it had been about 700 years since its establishment.  Thus its founding dates back to 1st century B.C.[/p][p]His purpose of going to Nālandā was to learn the principles of the Yoga-sastra, The chief monk Silabhadra admitted Ht.  as his disciple.  Among the students there were many foreigners.  According to Ht.  of all the sanghārāmas of India Nālandā Monastery was the most remarkable for its grandeur and height.  Resident students numbered ten thousand.  They studied the teachings of all the eighteen schools and also subjects such as the Vedas, the Hetuvidyā, Sabdavidyā, the Cikitsāvidyā, the works on magic (Atharvaveda) and the Sānkhya system.  There were 1541 scholars who were versed in various branches of study.  Within the temple hundred pupils were being arranged every day for preaching and students attended these and participated in discussions without fail.[/p][p]As for the source of income of the Nālandā monastery Ht.  tells us that there was a farm-house belonging to the monastery.  The account does not say anything about the way in which the farm was run and how the income accrued to the monastery.  There were other sources of income too.  According to Ht.  the king of the country remitted the revenue of about hundred villages for the endowment of the convent.  Two hundred house holders in these villages contributed rice, butter and milk daily.  Hence students had no complaints to make about their requisites.[/p][p]In Rājagrha he locates many important sites connected with various episodes; for instance, the site of the stupa where Devadatta in conjunction with Ajātasatru rājā let loose the drunken elephant with intent to kill the Buddha.  Referring to the Grdhrakūta (Ki-li-to-lo-kiu) it is said that while residing there the Buddha declared the Saddharmapundarika (Fa-hwa), the Mahāprajñā (Tapan-jo) and numerous other Sutras.[/p][p]His account on the First Council held in Rājagrha is rather misleading.  It appears that he has incorporated into it certain details which deal with later councils.  According to Ht.  the collection of scriptures authorised by the Council came to be called Sthavira collection because Kāsyapa (Mahā Kassapa) officiated as the president of the assembly.  As regards the emergence of the Mahāsanghika school Ht.  informs us that monks who were excluded from the Council held by Mahā Kāsyapa assembled in Rājagrha and made a collection of the doctrine in five Pitakas, the Sutra Pitaka, the Vinaya Pitaka, the Abhidhamma Pitaka, the Miscellaneous Pitaka and the Dhārani Pitaka.  How this assembly got the name Mahāsanghika is explained as follows: "As in this assembly there were ordinary persons (Fan-fu) and holy men it was called the Convocation of the Mahāsanghikas (The Life, p.  117 cp.  Dipavamsa, H.  Oldenberg, New Delhi, 1982, 5,30).[/p][p]Having visited sacred places in the vicinity of Nālandā Ht.  returned to the Nālandā Monastery again and studied several texts such as the Yoga-sastra, the Nyāyānusārasastra, the Hin-hiang-tui-fa-ming, the Hetuvidyā-sastra, the Prānyamūla-sastra-tīkā and the Sata-sastra.  Although he had studied the Kosa-vibhāsā and the Satpadābhidharma-sastra in different parts of Kashmir yet he studied them again at Nālandā Monastery.  He also studied Brahman literary works and a grammatical treatise the author of which is not known.  On the task of studying the Buddhist and Brahman texts he spent five years.[/p][p]The next country he visited was Hiranyaparvata (I-lanna-po-fa-to) where he stayed for one year and read the Vibhāsā and the Nyāyānusāra-sastra etc.  From Hiranyaparvata he made his way to the kingdom of Champa where monks followed the Little Vehicle.  This country was infested with wild beasts such as the elephant, wolf, rhinoceros and black leopard.  Elephants in that country were used for drawing carriages.[/p][p]Countries between Champa (Chen-po) and Samatata (San-to-ch'a) form another phase of his long journey.  He visited Hiranya, Kajughira (Ki-shu-ko-kie-lo), Pundravardhana (Pu-na-fa-tan-na) Karnasuvarna (Kielo-na-su-fala-na) before arriving at Samatata.  Monks in Pundravardhana belonged to both vehicles whereas those in Karnasuvarna belong to the Little Vehicle of the Sammitiya school.  Monks in Karnasurvarna did not use either butter or milk in keeping with the traditional teachings of Devadatta.  Immediately after his account on Samatata he refers to Pegu and Siam which, however, lay outside his itinerary.[/p][p]Countries included in his itinerary in the East and South-east of India were Tāmralipti (Tan-mo-li-ti), Orissa, Kalinga (Kie-ling-kia), Southern Kosala (Kiao-sa-lo), Andhra (An-to-lo), Dhanakataka (To-na-kie-tse-kia) and Chulya.  All these countries had centres of Buddhism.  He refers to an entrepot called Caritra (Chi-li-ta-lo) situated on the South-eastern frontier of Orissa.[/p][p]Dhanakataka, according to Ht.  was once a reputed centre of learning, and learned men used to come and dwell there but at the time of his visit it was entirely desolate.[/p][p]The Kingdom of Chulya may be identified with the Cola Kingdom.  He locates the Chulya Kingdom outside the Dravida country.  What made him follow this description is not clear.  The Cola Kingdom formed part of the Dravida country through the ages.[/p][p]The next place he visited was the Kingdom of Dravida.  The territory occupied by Dravida people could have consisted of several kingdoms or countries, but Ht.  refers to it as forming one kingdom.  However, the capital of that kingdom is named Kanchipura, the birth place of Dharmapāla Bodhisattva.[/p][p]Whilst in Kanchipura Ht.  met some three hundred monks from Sinhala.  They informed him of the unsettled situation prevailing in Sri Lanka at the time.  This dissuaded him from going there.  His purpose of going to Sinhala was to get the Tripitaka explained according to the Sthavira school there and also to study the Yoga Sāstra.[/p][p]Malakūta was the next important place he visited.  He refers to Malayagiri which was well-known for sandalwood and the karpūra scented tree.  After Malakūta (Mole-kiu-ch'a) he refers to Sinhala again.  According to Ht.  Sinhala was originally called Po-chu as it had many gems of a rare character.  As for the origin of the Sinhala he narrates with slight variations the legend which traced the origin to a lion king and the murder of the lion by his son.  According to Ht.  it was the son of the lion who arrived in Po-chu and not his grandson Vijaya as recorded in Sri Lankan chronicles.  A second theory about the origin of the Sinhala is narrated as follows: "But it is also said that Sinhala is the name of a merchant's son, who......  came to Po-chu island and slew the Rakshasas and established his capital in the country.[/p][p]With regard to the teachings prevailing in Sri Lanka he adds that monks there follow the teachings of the Great Vehicle and they belong to the school of the sthaviras.  He also refers to the schism which resulted in the division of the Sangha into two factions, the Mahāviharavāsins who were opposed to the Great Vehicle and the Abhayagirivāsins who studied both vehicles.  His reference to a mountain named Lankāgiri may be the Samantakūta (Adam's Peak) and it was on that mountain the Tathāgata delivered the Lankāvatāra Sutra according to Ht.[/p][p]Going two thousand li from Dravida he arrived at Konkanpura (Kin-na-po-lo) and from there to Maharashtra, He tells us that in a vihāra at Konkanpura there was a precious head-dress of Prince Siddhārtha.  With reference to Maharashtra he says that the people of that country were a warlike nation.  He cites in evidence the unsuccessful attempt of Silāditya rājā to subjugate Pulakesin.  This king may be identified as Pulakesin II (609-642 A.C) of the Chalukyas of Vatapi in the Bijapur District.[/p][p]Among the countries included in his itinerary to the West and North-west of Narmada were Broach (Baroche), Mālava (Mo-la-po), Brāhmanapura (K'ie-ch'a), Vallabhi (Fa-la-pi), Anandapura, Surāshtra (Lasn-c'ha) Gurjjara (Kiu-che-lo), Ujjayin (U-che-yen-na), Chi-ki-to, Mahesvarapura, Surātha, Atyanabakela (O-tin-p'o-chi-lo) and Langala (Lang-kie-lo).  The last country is situated near the Great Sea towards the country of western women.  If Mālavas were the people of Malava or Malwa in Central India as is generally taken the countries named about are not placed in right order.  Ujjayini which is the capital of Malwa is named after Surashtra and Gurjjara situated in Gujarat.[/p][p]Of all the countries in India, Ht.  had a very high opinion of Mālava and Magadha.  He says that people of these two countries had the reputation of loving the study of literature, of honouring virtue, of polite language and refined speech.  In Mālava there were twenty thousand monks studying the teaching of the Sammitiya school of the small vehicle.[/p][p]We are told that going north-west from Langāla he went to Persia (Po-la-sse) which, lay outside India.  It is said that the bowl (patrā) of the Sakyamuni Buddha was in the royal palace of the country.  On its frontier is the city of Ormus (Ho-mo).  The countries mentioned next are Babylon? (Fo-lin), an island called the country of the Western women, which is tributary to Fo-lin, Langala, Pitasila (Pi-to-shi-lo), Avanda, Sindh (Sin-tu) Mūlasthānapura or Multan (Mu-lo-s'an-po-la) and Parvati.[/p][p]If Avanda is to be identified with Avanti in Central India which seems probable in view of his descriptions of that country, it is difficult to place Avanda on the route followed from Langala to Multan.[/p][p]The country called Parvata was noted for renowned scholars.  Ht.  stayed there for two years and studied the Mūlābhidharma-sastra, the Saddharma-samparigrahasāstra and the Prasiksāsatya-sāstra as preserved in the Sammitiya school.[/p][p]From Parvata he returned south-eastwardly to Magadha and from there to the Nālandā Monastery.  There was in Nālandā a renowned monk called Prajñabhadra who was versed in the Three Pitakas, Sāstras etc.  Ht.  remained there for two years and had his doubts cleared through discussions.  He spent two more years studying several branches of study under a renowned lay scholar named Jayasena.[/p][p]He is said to have been apprised of the time for his return journey in a dream by Maitreya Bodhisattva.  However, he was delayed due to unavoidable circumstances.  In the meantime, Silabhadra, the master of sastras at Nālandā deputed Ht.  to expound to the congregation there the Mahāyāna-samparigraha-sastra and to comment on the difficult points of the Vidyā-mātra-siddhi-sastra.[/p][p]About this time Simharasmi and Ht.  held two different views about the principles of Yoga.  Ht.  proved more competent in the encounter and composed a sastra in three thousand slokas resolving the controversy.  This work was later approved for study.  At this time further disputes took place between the adherents of the two vehicles.[/p][p]Monks in Orissa belittled the Great Vehicle and were used to calling it "Sky Flowers".  But the king of that country had a high regard for the Great Vehicle and challenged the authority of the critics.  Monks thereupon requested the king to hold a conference at which they would settle the issue.  The controversy does not appear to have taken place at a conference as expected but it came to an end with the compilation of a book which was written by Ht.  in refutation of the heretical views held by the monks of Orissa.  The way he refuted heretical views made his fame so widespread that king Kumārarāja of Karnasuvarna in Eastern India longed to have him as his spiritual head in his kingdom.  When Ht.  showed his reluctance for the third time the king turned furious and even went to the extent of threatening that he would destroy the whole of Nālandā Monastery in case his request was turned down.  Although at last Ht, complied with the request of the king, Silāditya rāja's intervention enabled him to get out of another embarrassing situation.[/p][p]Silāditya rāja on his part made arrangements to hold a conference for the exposition of the Great Vehicle and to refute the views of the followers of the Little Vehicle.  Princes of eighteen countries were invited to participate in the conference.  Renowned Buddhist monks, celebrated Brahmans, heretics, non-believers and secular persons attended the conference.  For five days Ht.  extolled the teachings of the Great Vehicle and no opponent had any opportunity to assert his views.  Adherents of the Little Vehicle learning that their school was shattered plotted to kill him.  The king, however, threatened to behead any one who made an attempt on the life of Ht.  It is said that, at the end, large multitudes forsook the Little Vehicle and embraced the Great-Vehicle.  When the conference was over Ht.  made up his mind to go back to his country.  But on a request made to him by Silāditya to witness the quinquennial distribution called 'Mahā moksa parisad' he had to postpone for ten days his return journey.[/p][p]For his return journey Ht.  chose to follow the northern route in order to keep the pledge made by him to the king of Kan-chang that he would visit him on his way back.  Getting out from the city of Prayāga he took the route which lay across Kausambi, Jalandhara, Simhapura, Taksasilā and the river Indus.  The boat laden with ola manuscripts and flower seeds capsized in the Indus and fifty manuscript copies and flower seeds were lost.  From there he went past Lamghan (Lan-po), Varna, Avakan, the snowy mountains, Kunduz (Hwoh), Tukhara, Kuran, Bolor and Kashgar up to Khotan.[/p][p]Of these countries Kashgar and Khotan were renowned centres of the Great Vehicle.  Whilst in Khotan he states that he accomplished a journey of more than 50,000 li.  His journey through various kingdoms took seventeen years.  Here he faced the problem of transporting his books, images and such articles and sent a messenger to Kau-chang asking for help.  Seven or eight months later transport facilities were arranged.[/p][p]Among the books he brought were 224 sutras and 192 sāstras of the Great Vehicle; 15 works of the same categories belonging to the Sammitiya School; 22 books of the same belonging to the Mahisāsaka school; 67 books....  of the Sthaviravādin school; 17 works....  of the Kāsyapiya school; 42 works.....  of the Dharmagupta school; 36 copies of the Hetuvidyā Sāstra; 13 copies of the Sabdavidyā sastra.  Altogether there were 520 copies comprising 657 volumes carried upon twenty horses.[/p][p]Then he set upon the gigantic task of translating these books into Chinese.  For carrying out this project he retired to the monastery of Hong-fu in Si-gan-fu.  He completed the translation of 74 distinct works having 1335 chapters.  He had moreover made a vast number of pictures and wrote with his own hands copies of various sutras.  When all these works had been finished he closed his eyes and lay perfectly still.  "Having recited some verses in adoration of Maitreya, he gradually sank until the day of his demise on the 10th March, the 13th day of the year 664."[/p][p]Hsūan-tsang's travel accounts which appear in the foregoing description furnish information on a wide variety of subjects.  Some of these such as physical barriers, the relative distribution of the centres of the Little and the Great Vehicle in and outside India, Buddhist monuments, hospitality shown in different countries, conferences, religious encounters have been surveyed in brief in the above account.  Apart from these he presents a wealth of information on a wide range of subjects such as economic, educational and social conditions, religious practices, mannerism, customs administration and so on.  He enumerates a number of ways of showing respect and paying homage that was prevalent among the people of India.  Some such forms are[/p][ul][li][p](i) greeting with a kind of enquiry; [/li][li][p](ii) reverently bowing the head; [/li][li][p](iii) raising the hands to the head with an inclination of the body; [/li][li][p](iv) bowing with hands folded on the chest; [/li][li][p](v) bending a knee; [/li][li][p](vi) kneeling down; [/li][li][p](vii) going down on the ground on hands and knees; [/li][li][p](viii) bowing down with knees, elbows and forehead to the ground and [/li][li][p](ix) prostrating oneself on the ground.[/li][/ul][p]Regarding the general education meant for Indians he describes that children in the beginning followed the 'Twelve Chapters' and at the age of seven they began to study the great treatises of the 'Five Sciences'.  Some idea of Buddhist education may be gained from his description of Nālandā referred to earlier, But his estimation of the Brahmanic system of educating beginners is very high.  Regarding the Brahmanic teachers he says: "These teachers explain the general meaning and teach them minutely, they rouse them to activity and skilfully win them over to progress, they instruct the inert and sharpen the dull.  When disciples intelligent and acute are addicted to idle shirking the teachers doggedly persevere repeating instruction until their training is finished....."[/p][p]Ht.  states that differences among various schools of Buddhism were seen in their tenets and also in customs.  According to Ht.  different schools had their own tenets, and controversies ran high.  As a result each of the eighteen schools claimed that each system was intellectually superior to others.  Tenets of the Great and the Little systems differed widely.  Certain concessions and gains were accorded to monks in keeping with their knowledge and where the spiritual attainments were high the distinctions conferred were extraordinary.[/p][p]Referring to the three robes allowed for monks as their costume he narrates that different schools adhered to different styles having broad or narrow fringes and small or large folds.  Ht.'s description about wearing sanghāti (seng-kio-ki) conforms to the present day practice of its wearing by monks in Sri Lanka and other Theravāda countries.  As for the antaravāsa, (ni-po-so-na) the undergarment, he says that it was worn without a belt.  Rather it was made into plaits and then secured by one of these plaits.[/p][p][/p][p]Regarding social organisation Ht.  informs us that society consists of four caste groups.  These four castes form classes of various degrees of ceremonial purity.  The members of a caste marry within the caste.  Relatives whether by the father's or mother's side do not intermarry and a woman never contracts a second marriage.[/p][p]Speaking about the character of the Indian people he tells us that they were of hasty and irresolute temperament but of pure moral principles.  They fear retribution for sins in future lives and take lightly their plight in the present life.  They keep their sworn obligations.[/p][p]His account on law and punishment too, is interesting.  According to him the offenders who violate statute law were imprisoned for life.  For offences against social morality, disloyalty and unfilial conduct the punishment was mutilation or banishment of the offender out of the country or into the wilderness.  Other offences can be atoned for by paying a fine.  He also describes the four ordeals by which the innocence or guilt of an accused person is determined.[/p][p]For offences against the Vinaya, the community of brethren has a gradation of penalties.  If the offence was slight a reprimand was ordered and the punishment became harsh according to the gravity of the offence.  Expulsion from the community was the worst punishment meted out to the most serious offender.[/p][p]As for the disposal of the dead and the performance of the last rites, there were three recognised customs.  The first of these was cremation.  The second was water burial, the corpse being put into a stream to float and dissolve.  The third was burial in the wilderness, the body being cast away in the woods to be eaten up by wild animals.[/p][p]The Buddhist brethren were forbidden to wail aloud over a departed one.  On the death of a parent they read a service of gratitude to secure for the deceased person bliss in the next life.[/p][p]If we are to depend on the records left by Ht.  certain kings of the Gupta dynasty have patronised Buddhism.  According to him Purugupta Vikrama Prakāsāditya, a brother of Skandagupta, Narasimhagupta Balāditya, son and successor of Purugupta, Tathāgatarāja Vainyagupta, another son of Purugupta and Vajira, a son of Narasimhagupta Balāditya patronised Buddhism.  All these kings contributed to the promotion of Buddhist learning by building monastic establishments at Nālandā.[/p][p]According to Ht.  the worship of relics was widely practised in many Buddhist countries traversed by him and among these the most popular was the cult of the Tooth Relic of the Buddha.  It was prevalent in Bhaktra; in an unnamed temple of a small valley situated to the east of the snowy mountain; Kashmir and Simbala.  The next popular Buddhist cult was that of the Bowl-relic.[/p][p]Purusapura, the capital of Gandhāra as well as Persia are mentioned as countries where the Bowl-relic was venerated.  The following objects too were venerated: the sweeping brush made of kusa grass in Bhaktra, the skull-bone at Hidda (Kilo of Fa-hsien) in Nagarahara (Jelalabad), the eye ball, the sanghāti robe, and the staff at the same site and the garment washing stone obtained in Udyāna.  A strong tradition about the Buddha presenting pieces of his nails and some hair to two merchants who offered him honey and rice cake is recorded by Ht.  with regard to Bhaktra (The Life p.50).  This is evidently based on the account in the Vinays Mahāvagga where two merchants play a similar role at Bodh Gaya though no reference is made there to the presentation of nails to them.[/p][p]On his way to India he passed through countries where Buddhism did not have adherents.  Two such countries were Kan-chang and Sa-mo-kien.  He succeeded in propagating Buddhism in those countries by delivering effective sermons.  In the latter some devotees were so taken up with the teachings that they even entered the Buddhist Order.  It was partly due to his evangelist endeavours that Buddhism which lay dormant after the age of the Guptas began to flourish during the reign of Harshavardhana.

Vijayabāhu III.  was cremated near the vihāra, and Parakkamabāhu II.  built there a cetiya and an octagonal image house which contained a stone image of the Buddha (Cv.lxxxv.73f).  It is said that a king, named Upatissa, had built in the monastery a five storeyed pāsāda in honour of a monk who made the earth and sky resound with thunder at the moment of his attainment of arahantship.  Parakkamabāhu II.  found it fallen into decay and had it restored in his name.  His minister, Devappatirāja, erected, in the king's name, a three storeyed pāsāda, gave it to Anomadassī Thera, who was chief incumbent of the vihāra at that time, and set up a stone inscription to record the gift.

Seeing the Green Frog at the mouth of the cage, the snake asked him if the fish had done right in attacking him.

  <entry>[div class="huge"]Himavā, Himācala, Himavanta, etc.  [/div][p]The name given to the Himālaya.  It is one of the seven mountain ranges surrounding Gandhamādana (SNA.i.66).[/p][p]It is three hundred thousand leagues in extent (SNA.i.224), with eighty four thousand peaks its highest peak being five hundred yojanas (SNA.ii.443) In Himavā, are seven great lakes, each fifty leagues in length, breadth and depth - Anotatta, Kannamunda, Rathakāra, Chaddanta, Kunāla, Mandākinī and Sīhappapātaka; these lakes are never heated by the sun (A.iv.101; SNA.ii.407; cf.  AA.ii.759).  From Himavā flow five hundred rivers.  SNA.ii.437; but according to Mil.114, only ten of these are to be reckoned, the others flowing only intermittently.  These ten are: Gangā, Yamunā, Aciravatī, Sarabhū, Mahī, Sindhu, Sarassatī, Vettavatī, Vītamsā and Candabhāgā.[/p][p]In numerous Jātakas Himavā is mentioned as the place to which ascetics retire when they leave household life.  It is full of woodlands and groves, suitable for hermits (E.g., SA.i.265).  In Himavā is a peak named Mahāpapāta where Pacceka Buddhas die (SNA.i.129).  Nāgas go to Himavā to give birth to their young (SA.iii.120; cf.  S.v.63).

  <entry>[div class="huge"]Gahapati Jātaka (No.199)[/div][p]Once, in Kāsi, the Bodhisatta's wife carried on an intrigue with the village headman.  The husband, determined to catch them, pretended to leave the village, but returned as soon as the headman entered the house.  The wife, seeing her husband, climbed into the granary, and professed that the headman was there to demand the price of meat which he had supplied to them during a famine, and that as there was no money he insisted on being given the value in grain, which, she said, she was determined to refuse to do.  But the Bodhisatta saw through the ruse, thrashed the headman and then his wife.[/p][p]The Buddha related the story to a backsliding monk to demonstrate to him how women were always sinful (J.ii.134f).[/p][hr]</entry>
