This was because his mother was a lioness. For a lioness, when she has eaten prey, goes into her cave where she lies, for seven days, on a bed of red arsenic and yellow orpiment. When she rises on the seventh day, if she finds the bed disturbed by any movement on her part, she again lies down for seven days, saying: &quot;This does not become your birth or lineage.&quot; When the monks praised Santakáya to the Buddha, he held up the Elder as an example to be followed.

He lived in a tree, and noticing one day that two of the boughs were grinding one against the other and producing smoke, he warned his flock of the risk of fire and left for elsewhere. The wiser birds followed him, but some remained behind and were burnt to death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related to a monk whose cell was burnt down. He told the villagers of this, and they continually promised to build him a new one, but failed to do so. As a result the monk lived in discomfort and his meditations were fruitless. When he reported this, the Buddha blamed him for not going elsewhere. J.i.215f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Sakulá Therí. &lt;/b&gt;She belonged to a brahmin family of Sávatthi and became a believer on seeing the Buddha accept Jetavana. Later, she heard an arahant monk preach, and, being agitated in mind, joined the Order. Having developed insight, she won arahantship. Afterwards the Buddha declared her foremost among nuns in dibbacakkhu (A.i.25).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Padumuttara Buddha she was Nandá, daughter of King Ananda, and, therefore, half sister of the Buddha. One day she heard the Buddha declare a nun chief among possessors of the &quot;heavenly eye” and herself wished for similar honour. In the time of Kassapa Buddha she was a brahminee and later became a Paribbájiká. One day she offered alms at the Buddha's thúpa and kept a lamp burning there all night. She was then reborn in Távatimsa. Thig. vss.98 101; ThigA.91f.; Ap.ii.569f.; AA.i.199f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Sakulá.&lt;/b&gt; Sister of Somá.

He heard Siddhattha Buddha preach at Amaruyyána and became an arahant (BuA.186). He is probably identical with Sambala (1).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Sambahula Sutta.&lt;/b&gt; Mára, in the guise of a brahmin, with top knot and antelope skin, aged and bent, visits a number of monks at Silávatí and asks them to enjoy pleasures because they are yet young. They should not abandon the things of this life in order to run after matters involving time. Natural desires, they reply, are matters involving time, full of sorrow and despair, not the doctrine practised by them which is immediate in its results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brahmin retires discomfited, and when the matter is reported to the Buddha, he identifies him with Mára.

In his previous birth he had been a smith, named Tissa, in Mundagangá, and his wife was Nágá (Sumaná). The couple gave a meal with pork to eight arahants, (for their names see MT.606) led by Dhammadinna Thera of Talangatissapabbata. It is said that on the day of birth the whole of Ceylon was filled with paddy, hence his name. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sáli was very pious, and all the revenues given to him by his father he gave away in charity. He kept the fast days in the Issarasamana-vihára and built the Sálipabbata vihára (MT.606). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He will be the son of Metteyya Buddha in his next birth.

Saranankara Thera.&lt;/b&gt; An eminent monk of Ceylon. Narindasíha, attracted by his piety and learning, gave him, while yet a sámanera, a reliquary studded with seven hundred jewels and numerous books, and also made provision for his maintenance. At the instance of the king, Saranankara composed the Sáratthasangraha and Singhalese Commentaries on the Mahábodhivamsa and the Bhessajjamañjúsá (Cv.xcvii.48ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Vijayarájasíha came to the throne, Saranankara lived in the Uposatháráma and composed, at the king's request, a Singhalese Commentary on the Catubhánavára (Cv.xcviii.23f). In the reign of Kittisirirájasíha he carried out, with the king's help, many reforms among the monks, adopting strong measures against delinquents. He was also instrumental in persuading the king to send an embassy to King Dhammika of Siam (Sáminda) in order to obtain from there a chapter of monks for the re establishment of the upasampadá in Ceylon. When this had been done, the king invested Saranankara with the dignity of Sangharája over Ceylon. Cv.c.49ff;101ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

When he died the Buddha declared that he was a sotápanna, bound for enlightenment. But many of the Sákyans spoke scornfully of him, saying that he had failed in the training and had taken to drink. Mahánáma reported this to the Buddha, who said that Sarakáni had, for a long time, taken refuge in the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha, and possessed qualities which secured him from birth in hell among the lowest animals and the peta world. S.v.375f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Sarakáni (Saranáni) Sutta.&lt;/b&gt; Mahánáma reports to the Buddha the rumours prevalent among the Sákyans regarding Sarakáni (q.v.). The Buddha says that Sarakáni had long since taken the Three Refuges, and he then goes on to describe various qualities, beginning from those which lead to the destruction of the ásavas to those, such as affection for the Buddha, which prevent men from going to the Downfall. S.v.375f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Sarakáni Sutta.&lt;/b&gt; Mahánáma brings to the Buddha's notice that the Sákyans are surprised at the Buddha's statement regarding the attainment of sotápatti by Sarakáni. The Buddha then describes the virtues which make a man an anágámí, a sakadágámí or a sotápanna. The Buddha's doctrine is like a good field, well stubbed, the seeds sown therein capable of sprouting and happily planted, and the sky god supplying a constant rain.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Sávatthi&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The capital town of Kosala in India and one of the six great Indian cities during the lifetime of the Buddha (D.ii.147). It was six leagues from Sáketa (Vin.i.253; seven according to others, DhA.i.387), forty five leagues north west of Rájagaha (SA.i.243), thirty leagues from Sankassa (J.iv.265), one hundred and forty seven from Takkasilá (MA.ii.987), one hundred and twenty from Suppáraka (DhA.ii.213), and was on the banks of the Aciravatí (Vin.i.191, 293). It was thirty leagues from Alaví (SNA.i.220), thirty from Macchíkásanda (DhA.ii.79), one hundred and twenty from Kukkutavatí (DhA.ii.118), and the same distance from Uggapura (DhA.iii.469) and from Kuraraghara (DhA.iv.106). The road from Rájagaha to Sávatthi passed through Vesáli (Vin.ii.159f), and the Paráyanavagga (SN.vss.1011 13) gives the resting places between the two cities   Setavyá, Kapilavatthu, Kusinárá, Pává and Bhoganagara. Further on, there was a road running southwards from Sávatthi through Sáketa to Kosambí. One gávuta from the city was the Andhavana (q.v.). Between Sáketa and Sávatthi was Toranavatthu (S.iv.374).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The city was called Sávatthi because the sage Savattha lived there. Another tradition says there was a caravanserai there, and people meeting there asked each other what they had   &quot;Kim bhandam atthi?&quot; &quot;Sabbam atthi&quot;   and the name of the city was based on the reply (SNA.i.300; PSA. 367).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha passed the greater part of his monastic life in Sávatthi. His first visit there was at the invitation of Anáthapindika. It is said (DhA.i.4) that he spent twenty five rainy seasons in the city   nineteen of them in Jetavana and six in the Pubbáráma. Sávatthi also contained the monastery of Rájakáráma (q.v.), built by Pasenadi, opposite Jetavana. </data>
<data>Outside the city gate of Sávatthi was a fisherman's village of five hundred families (DhA.iv.40).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Savatthi is the scene of each Buddha's Yamaka pátiháriya (DhA.iii.205; cf. Mtu.iii.115; J.i.88); Gotama Buddha performed this miracle under the Gandamba (q.v.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chief patrons of the Buddha in Sávatthi were Anáthapindika, Visákhá, Suppavásá and Pasenadi (DhA.i.330). When Bandhula (q.v.) left Vesáli he came to live in Sávatthi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buddhaghosa says (Sp.iii.614) that, in the Buddha's day, there were fifty seven thousand families in Sávatthi, and that it was the chief city in the country of Kási Kosala, which was three hundred leagues in extent and had eighty thousand villages. The population of Sávatthi was eighteen crores (SNA.i.371).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sávatthi is identified with Sáhet Máhet on the banks of the Rapti (Cunningham, AGI. 469).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hiouen Thsang found the old city in ruins, but records the sites of various buildings (Beal, op. cit., ii.1 13).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Woodward states (KS.v.xviii ) that, of the four Nikáyas, 871 suttas are said to have been preached in Sávatthi; 844 of which are in Jetavana, 23 in the Pubbáráma, and 4 in the suburbs. These suttas are made up of 6 in the Digha, 75 in the Majjhima, 736 in the Samyutta, and 54 in the Anguttara. Mrs. Rhys Davids conjectures (M.iv., Introd., p.vi) from this that either the Buddha &quot;mainly resided there or else Sávatthi was the earliest emporium (library?) for the collection and preservation (however this was done) of the talks.&quot; The first alternative is the more likely, as the Commentaries state that the Buddha spent twenty five rainy seasons in Sávatthi (see earlier), this leaving only twenty to be spent elsewhere. The Buddhavamsa Commentary (BuA. p.3) gives a list of these places showing that the second, third, fourth, </data>
<data>seventeenth and twentieth were spent in Rájagaha, the thirteenth, eighteenth and nineteenth in Cáliyapabbata, and the rest in different places.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Sátágira&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Yakkha. He and his friend, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/h/hemavata')"&gt;Hemavata&lt;/a&gt;, were two of the twenty eight leaders of the Yakkhas. They had both been monks in the time of Kassapa Buddha, but had been guilty of deciding wrongly in the dispute which arose between &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/dhammavaadi')"&gt;Dhammavádí&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/am/adhammavaadi')"&gt;Adhammavádí&lt;/a&gt;, hence their birth as Yakkhas, Sátágira in Sátapabbata, and Hemavata in Himavá. They recognized each other at the Yakkha assembly in the Bhagalavatí pabbata, and promised to inform each other if, in their lives, they came across anything of interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the Buddha was born and when he preached his first sermon, Sátágira was present in the assembly, but, because he was constantly looking about to see if Hemavata was there, he could not concentrate his mind on the Buddha's teaching. When the sun set and the Buddha was still preaching, he went with five hundred of his followers to fetch Hemavata. At Rájagaha they met Hemavata, who was on the way to invite Sátágira to Himavá, which was covered with such flowers as had never before been seen. Sátágira explains that the reason for this miracle is the appearance of the Buddha in the world, and, in answer to Hemavata's questions, declares the greatness of the Buddha.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their conversation is found in the introductory gáthá of the Hemavata Sutta (q.v.). Buddhaghosa says (SNA.i.199) that, according to some, this meeting took place, not on the occasion of the first sermon, but later, when the Buddha was living in the Gotámaka cetiya. &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kaalii')"&gt;Káli Kuraraghariká&lt;/a&gt;, as she sat by her window cooling herself, heard the conversation of the two Yakkhas, and her mind being filed with devotion to the Buddha, as she heard his wonderful qualities being </data>
<data>enumerated she attained sotápatti.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Hemavata is satisfied, from Sátágira's description, that the Buddha is really the Awakened One, he decides to go to him with Sátagira. Together they go with their followers to Isipatana in the middle watch of the night, and Hemavata questions the Buddha about his teaching. Hemavata is, by nature, powerful and wise and filled with respect for the good, and the Buddha's marvellous exposition of the dhamma fills him with great joy. He sings the Buddha's praises in five stanzas, and, after taking leave of him and of Sátágira, returns home with the promise that he will wander from place to place carrying the joyful news of the Buddha and his Dhamma among all beings. This story is given in the Commentary to the Hemavata Sutta; SNA.i.194 216; cf. AA.i.134f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later, when journeying through the air in various conveyances, on their way to the Yakkha assembly, Sátágira and Hemavata and their followers were about to pass over &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/aa/aalavaka')"&gt;Alavaka's&lt;/a&gt; hermitage; but because the Buddha was then inside, the Yakkhas found that their conveyances remained stationary as no one could pass over the head of the Buddha. When they thus discovered his presence, they alighted and made obeisance to the Buddha, and congratulated Alavaka on his extreme good fortune in having an opportunity of meeting and listening to the Buddha. AA.i.221; a similar story is related (UdA.64) about them when they passed the abode of the Yakkha Ajakalápaka.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sátágira is mentioned in the Atánátiya Sutta (D.iii.204) as one of the Yakkhas to be invoked in time of need by the Buddha's followers. He is identified with the Yakkha of the Bhisa Játaka. J.iv.314.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

King Narapatisithu gave them his patronage, but extended it to other sects as well, and the Síhalasangha, therefore, remained only as one sect among several in Burma.

On being invited to the Sárandada cetiya, the Buddha went to them, and, having heard of their discussion, told them of five treasures much more rare in the world: the Tathágata, his Dhamma, a person able to recognize the Dhamma in the world, one who follows it, and one who is grateful. A.iii.167 f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Sárandada Sutta.&lt;/b&gt; Once, a number of Licchavis visited the Buddha at the Sárandada cetiya, and he told them of seven things which would ensure their welfare and prevent them from falling: frequent assemblies, concord, honouring of tradition and convention, respect for elders, courtesy towards women, homage paid to places of worship, and protection of holy men in their midst. A.iv.16f.; cf. D.ii.72ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This sutta is often referred to in the books, and the virtues mentioned are famous as the satta aparihániyadhammá.

The Buddha saw in him the conditions of arahantship, and went to him and taught the Dhamma. He listened and joined the Order, attaining arahantship in due course. He continued to live in his hut till it decayed and crumbled away, and, when asked why he did not repair it he answered that he bad looked after it during his ascetic practices, but that now he had no time for such things. He then declared his aññá in a series of verses. ThagA.i.480 f. These verses are found in Thag.vs.487 93.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3.

He built six alms halls and spent daily six hundred thousand pieces on alms. He lived a good life, and his subjects followed his example. In the assembly of the Devas his praises were spoken, and various Devas wished to see him. So Sakka sent Mátalí, with his chariot, to fetch Sádhína to Távatimsa. When he arrived, Sakka gave him half his kingdom and his luxuries. For seven hundred years, in human reckoning, Sádhína ruled in heaven, and then he became dissatisfied and returned to his royal park on earth. The park keeper brought news of his arrival to Nárada, the reigning king, seventh in direct descent from Sádhína. Nárada arrived, paid homage to Sádhína, and offered him the kingdom. But Sátdhína refused it, saying that all he wished was to distribute alms for seven days. Nárada arranged a vast largesse for distribution. For seven days Sádhína gave alms, and on the seventh day he died and was born in Távatimsa. The story was related to lay disciples to show them the importance of keeping the fast day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ananda is identified with Nárada and Anuruddha with Sakka (J.iv.355 60).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sádhína was one of the four human beings who went to Távatimsa while in their human body.

He longed to see Sankicca, but it was not till fifty years later that Sankicca, with five hundred followers, came to the garden of Dayápassa in Benares. The king visited him and questioned him on the results of wickedness. Sankicca described the horrors of hell awaiting the wicked, illustrating his story with stories  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/am/ajjuna')"&gt;Ajjuna&lt;/a&gt; who annoyed the sage Gotama,   &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/dandakii')"&gt;Dandaki&lt;/a&gt;, who defied Kisavaccha, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;of the king of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/me_mu/mejjha')"&gt;Mejjha&lt;/a&gt;, whose country became a desert, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/andhakavenhu_puttaa')"&gt;Andhavenhudásaputtá&lt;/a&gt; who assailed Dípáyana, and of Cecca, swallowed up by the earth. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;After describing the terrors awaiting the victims of various hells, Sankicca showed the king the deva worlds and ended his discourse, indicating the possibility of making amends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The king was much comforted and changed his ways. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is identified with &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/am/ajatasattu')"&gt;Ajátasattu&lt;/a&gt;, in </data>

The constant attendant of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pu/phussa')"&gt;Phussa&lt;/a&gt; Buddha. J.i.41; Bu.xix.19.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Sabhiya Thera.&lt;/b&gt; His mother was a nobleman's daughter whose parents had committed her to the charge of a &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/paribbajaka')"&gt;Paribbájaka&lt;/a&gt;, that she might learn various doctrines and usages. The Paribbájaka seduced her, and, when she was with child, the fraternity abandoned her. Her child was born in the open (sabháyam), while she was wandering about alone   hence his name. When Sabhiya grew up he, in his turn, became a Paribbájaka and was famous as a dialectician. He had a hermitage by the city gate, where he gave lessons to the sons of noblemen and others. He devised twenty questions, which he put before recluses and brahmins, but none could answer them. These questions had been handed on to him by his mother who had developed insight and had been reborn in a Brahma world. (But see Sabhiya Sutta 1). Then, as related in the &lt;a href="#1"&gt;Sabhiya Sutta 1&lt;/a&gt;, Sabhiya visited the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddha')"&gt;Buddha&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/veluvana')"&gt;Veluvana&lt;/a&gt; and, at the end of the discussion, entered the Order, where, developing insight, he won arahantship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kakusandha')"&gt;Kakusandha&lt;/a&gt; Buddha he was a householder and gave the Buddha a pair of sandals. After Kassapa Buddha's death he, with six others, joined the Order and lived in the forest. Failing to develop &lt;a href="http://www.palikanon.com/english/wtb/g_m/jhaana')"&gt;jhána&lt;/a&gt;, they went to the top of a mountain, determined to reach some attainment or to die of starvation. The eldest became an arahant, the next became an anágámí and was </data>
<data>reborn in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/suddhaavaasaa')"&gt;Suddhávasá&lt;/a&gt;. The remaining five died without achieving their aim. These five were, in this age, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pu/pukkusati')"&gt;Pukkusáti&lt;/a&gt;, Sabhiya, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/baahiya')"&gt;Báhiya&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kumaara_kassapa')"&gt;Kumárakassapa&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/dabba_mallaputta_th')"&gt;Dabbamallaputta&lt;/a&gt;. ThagA.i.381f.; SNA.ii.419ff.; Ap.ii.473; DhA.ii.212.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sabhiya is mentioned as an example of a pandita Paribbájaka (SA.ii.188). A series of verses spoken by him, in admonishing monks who sided with &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/devadatta')"&gt;Devadatta&lt;/a&gt;, are given in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/t/theragaathaa')"&gt;Theragáthá&lt;/a&gt; (vs. 275 8; see also Mtu.iii.389ff.). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/y/yasadatta_thera')"&gt;Yasadatta&lt;/a&gt; (q.v.) was Sabhiya's companion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Sabhiya. &lt;/b&gt;A &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/paribbajaka')"&gt;Paribbájaka&lt;/a&gt;, perhaps identical with Sabhiya (2). The Samyutta (S.iv.401f ) records a discussion which took place at Ñátiká between him and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/va/vacchagotta')"&gt;Vacchagotta&lt;/a&gt; on various questions, such as the existence of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddha')"&gt;Buddha&lt;/a&gt; after death, etc. In this sutta, Sabhiya is addressed as &lt;b&gt;Kaccána&lt;/b&gt;, and he says that he had then been three years in the Order. It is probably this same Paribbájaka who is mentioned as Abhiya Kaccána in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/anuruddha_s_samy')"&gt;Anuruddha Sutta&lt;/a&gt;. M.iii.148f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a name="1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;.

A devatá, who in a previous life had been a </data>
<data>relation of Sabhiya (see Sabhiya 1), asks him a series of questions and exhorts him to join the Order of any recluse who can answer them satisfactorily. Sabhiya wanders about asking his questions of several well known teachers; failing to find satisfaction, he visits the Buddha in &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/veluvana')"&gt;Veluvana&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/r/raajagaha')"&gt;Rájagaha&lt;/a&gt; and is given permission to ask anything he wishes, the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddha')"&gt;Buddha&lt;/a&gt; promising to solve his difficulties. Then follows a series of questions answered by the Buddha. Sabhiya, in the end, asks permission to join the Buddha's Order. This permission is given, and after the usual probationary period of four months, he becomes an arahant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Theragáthá Commentary (ThagA.i.382), quoted also in the Sutta Nipáta Commentary, the questions were formulated by Sabhiya's mother, who, feeling revulsion for her womanhood, developed the jhánas and was reborn in a Brahma world. But the Sutta Nipáta Commentary itself (SNA.ii.421) says that they were taught to Sabhiya by an anágámí Brahmá, who had been a fellow celibate of Sabhiya in the time of Kassapa Buddha's dispensation. The Sutta is also called Sabhiya pucchá, and is given (E.g., DA.i.155) as an example of the Buddha's sabbaññupavárana, his willingness to answer any question whatever without restriction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is said (ThagA.i.427) that &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/y/yasadatta_thera')"&gt;Yasadatta&lt;/a&gt;, Sabhiya's companion, was present at the discussion with the Buddha and listened eagerly hoping for a chance of criticism.

<data>the answers disappeared. VibhA., p. 432.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2.

Sañjiva. &lt;/b&gt;One of the two chief disciples of Kakusandha Buddha (D.ii.4; J.i.42; Bu.xxiii.20). He was expert in samádhi, and lived in cells, caves, etc., sustaining himself on samádhi. One day, when in a state of trance in a forest, woodmen, thinking him dead, burnt his body, but he, emerging at the proper time from his trance, shook out his robes and entered the village for alms; hence his name, Sañjíva (Quick) (M.i.333; cf. DA.ii.417; MA.i.522; PSA.496). This feat is referred to as an example of samádhi-vipphára iddhi. E.g., Vsm.380, 706; PS.ii.212; BuA.24, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2.

Ságata Thera. &lt;/b&gt;He was the personal attendant of the Buddha at he time when Sona Kolvisa visited Bimbisára, with overseers of the eighty thousand townships of Bimbisára's kingdom. Ságata was endowed with supernatural power, and the overseers, who went to visit the Buddha at Gijjhakúta, were very impressed by his iddhi, so much so that even while the Buddha was preaching they could not take their eyes off him. The king thereupon asked Ságata to show them a greater marvel, and Ságata, having shown in the open sky wonders of various kinds, fell at the Buddha's feet and declared the Buddha his teacher (Vin.i.179 f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later, when the Buddha went to stay in Bhaddavatiká, having heard men warn the Buddha of the proximity of a Nága of great power in the Jatila hermitage at Ambatittha, Ságata went there and lived in the Nága's abode. The Nága showed great resentment, but Ságata overpowered him with his iddhi and then returned to Bhaddavatiká. From there he went with the Buddha to Kosambí, where the lay disciples, hearing of his wondrous feat, paid him great honour. When they asked what they could do for his comfort, he remained silent, but the Chabbaggíyá suggested that they should provide him with white spirits (kápotiká).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next day, when Ságata went for alms, he was invited to various houses, where the inmates plied him with intoxicating drinks. So deep were his potations that on his way out of the town he fell prostrate at the gateway. The monks carried him, and at the monastery they laid him down with his head at the Buddha's feet, but he turned round so that his feet lay towards the Buddha.

AA.i.178f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is said (AA.i.179) that on the next day, when Ságata came to himself and realized the enormity of his offence, he sought the Buddha and, having begged his forgiveness, developed insight, attaining arahantship. The Buddha later declared him foremost among those skilled in the contemplation of the heat element (tejodhátukusalánam) (A.i.25).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is curious that no verses are ascribed to Ságata in the Theragáthá. The Apadána (Ap.i.83f) contains a set of verses said to have been spoken by him. In the time of Padumuttara Buddha he was Sobhita, a brahmin. The Buddha came to his hermitage with his disciples, and Ságata spoke verses in praise of the Buddha, who declared his future destiny. The Commentary adds that he was called Ságata because he was greatly welcome (ságata) to his parents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Sáketa&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A town in Kosala. It was regarded in the Buddha's time as one of the six great cities of India, the others being Campá, Rájagaha, Sávatthi, Kosambí and Benares (D.ii.146). It was probably the older capital of Kosala, and is mentioned as such in the Nandiyamiga Játaka. J.iii.270; cf. Mtu.i.348, 349, 350, where it is called the capital of King Sujáta of the Sákyan race. See also the Kumbha Játaka (J.ii.13), where Sáketa is mentioned as one of the places into which alcohol was introduced quite soon after its discovery by Sura and Varuna. According to the Mahánárada Kassapa Játaka (J.vi.228), it was the birthplace of Bijaka, aeons ago. In this context it is called Sáketá. According to a tradition, recorded in the Mahávastu, Sáketa was the city from which Sákyan princes were exiled when they founded Kapilavatthu. E. J. Thomas accepts this view (op. cit., 16f.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dhammapada Commentary (DhA.i.386), however, states that the city was founded in the Buddha's time by Dhanañjaya, father of Visákhá, when, at the special invitation of Pasenadi, he went from Rájagaha to live in Kosala. On the way to Sávatthi with Pasenadi, Dhañanjaya pitched his camp for the night, and learning from the king that the site of the camp was in Kosalan territory and seven leagues from Sávatthi, Dhanañjaya obtained the king's permission to found a city there. And because the site was first inhabited in the evening (sáyam), the city came to be called Sáketa. The Divyávadána (211) has another explanation of the name, in connection with the coronation of Mandhátá (Svayam ágatam svayam ágatam Sáketa Sáketam iti sañjná samvrttá).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reference is probably to a new settlement established by Dhanañjaya in the old city.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also learn from the Visuddhimagga (p.390; but see </data>
<data>below) that the distance from Sáketa to Sávatthi was seven leagues (yojanas), and there we are told that when the Buddha, at the invitation of Cúla subhaddá, went from Sávatthi to Sáketa, he resolved that the citizens of the two cities should be able to see each other. In the older books (E.g., Vin.i.253) however, the distance is given as six leagues. The town lay on the direct route between Sávatthi and Patitthána, and is mentioned (SN.vss.1011 1013) as the first stopping place out of Sávatthi. The distance between the two places could be covered in one day, with seven relays of horses (M.i.149), but the books contain several references (E.g., Vin.i.88, 89, 270; iii.212; iv. 63, 120) to the dangers of the journey when undertaken on foot. The road was infested with robbers, and the king had to maintain soldiers to protect travellers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Midway between Sáketa and Sávatthi was Toranavatthu, and it is said (S.iv.374 ff) that, when Pasenadi went from the capital to Sáketa, he spent a night in Toranavatthu, where be visited Khemá Therí who lived there. Between Sáketa and Sávatthi was a broad river which could be crossed only by boat (Vin.iv.65, 228). Near Sáketa was the Añjanavana, where the Buddha sometimes stayed during his visits to Sáketa and where he had several discussions   e.g., with Kakudha (S.i.54), Mendasira (q.v.), and Kundaliya (S.v.73; see also Kálaka Sutta and Jará Sutta and Sáketa Sutta).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On other occasions he stayed at the Kálakáráma (A.ii.24) gifted to the Order by Kálaka(q.v.), and the Tikantakivana (A.iii.169), both of which were evidently near the city. Mention is also made (E.g., S.v.174, 298 f.; for Sáriputta, see also Vin.i.289) of Sáriputta, Moggallána and&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anuruddha staying together in Sáketa; Bhaddákápiláni (Vin.iv.292) also stayed there, so did Ananda. Once when Ananda was staying in </data>
<data>the Migadáya in the Anjanavana, a nun, described as Jatilagáhiká (probably a follower of the Jatilas), visited him and questioned him regarding concentration. A.iv.427. Among others who lived in Sáketa were Jambugámikaputta, Gavampati, Mendasira, Uttara, Madhuvásettha and his son Mahánága, and Visákhá. Bhúta Thera (q.v.) was born in a suburb of Sáketa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buddhaghosa says (SNA.ii.532 f.; cf. DhA.iii.317f. and Saketa Játaka) that there lived at Sáketa a brahmin and his wife who, in five hundred lives, had been the parents of the Buddha. When the Buddha visited Sáketa they met him, and, owing to their fondness for him, came to be called Buddhapitá and Buddhamátá, their family being called Buddhakula.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to some accounts (E.g., AA.ii.482; but see Cúla-Subhaddá), Anáthapindika’s daughter, Cúla-Subhaddá, was married to the son of Kálaka, a setthi of Sáketa. Kálaka was a follower of the Niganthas, but he allowed Subhaddá to invite the Buddha to a meal. She did this by scattering eight handfuls of jasmine-flowers into the air from her balcony. The Buddha read her thoughts, and went to Sáketa the next day with five hundred arahants. At Sakka's request, Vessavana (Vissakamma?) provided gabled chambers in which the Buddha and his monks travelled by air to Sáketa. At the end of the meal, the Buddha preached to Kálakasetthi, who became a sotápanna, and gave the Kálakáráma for the use of the monks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Vinaya (Vin.i.270f) mentions another setthi of Sáketa. His wife had suffered for seven years from a disease of the head, and even skilled physicians failed to cure her. Jívaka, on his way to Rájagaha, after finishing his studies in Takkasilá, visited Sáketa, heard of her illness, and offered to cure her. At first the setthi was sceptic, but in the end allowed Jívaka to attend on his wife. Jívaka cured her by the administration of ghee </data>
<data>through the nose, and, as reward, received sixteen thousand kahápanas from her and her various kinsmen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sáketa, is supposed to be identical with Ayojjhá (CAGI. 405), but as both cities are mentioned in the Buddha's time, they are probably distinct. Rhys Davids thinks that possibly they adjoined each other &quot;like London and Westminster&quot; (Bud. India, p. 39. See also Sáketa Sutta, Sáketa Játaka, Sáketapañha). The site of Sáketa has been identified with the ruins of Suján Kot, on the Sai River, in the Unao district of the modern province of Oudh. The river referred to is probably the Sarayú, which flows into the Gharghara, a tributary of the Ganges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Sabbakáma.&lt;/b&gt; One of the chief disciples of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/sumedha')"&gt;Sumedha&lt;/a&gt; Buddha. J.i.38; Bu.xii.23.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Sabbakáma (v.l. Sabbakámí).&lt;/b&gt; An arahant Thera. He was born in a noble family of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/vesaali')"&gt;Vesáli&lt;/a&gt;, shortly before the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddha')"&gt;Buddha's&lt;/a&gt; death. When he came of age he gave away his possessions to his kinsfolk and joined the Order under &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/aa/aananda')"&gt;Ananda&lt;/a&gt;. In the course of his studies, he returned to Vesáli with his teacher and visited his family. His former wife, afflicted, thin, in sad array and in tears, greeted him and stood by. Seeing her thus, he was overwhelmed with love and pity and felt carnal desire. When he realized this, he was filled with anguish and hurried to the charnel field, there to meditate on foulness. He developed insight and became an arahant. Later, his father in law brought his wife to the vihára, beautifully dressed, and accompanied by a great retinue, hoping to make him return, but the Thera convinced them that he had rid himself of all such desires. See Thag. vss. 453 8.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sabbakáma lived on to one hundred and twenty years of age, and was consulted by &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/y/yasa')"&gt;Yasa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/r/revata')"&gt;Soreyya Revata&lt;/a&gt;, and others, in connection with the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/va/vajjiputtakaa')"&gt;Vajjiputta&lt;/a&gt; heresy. He was, at that time, the oldest Thera in the world. He sat on the committee appointed to examine the points in dispute and decided against the Vajjaputtakas, giving his reasons point by point. For details see Vin.ii.303ff.; also Dpv.iv.49; v. 22; Mhv.iv.48, 576; Sp.i.34.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
<data>&lt;p&gt;The Theragáthá Commentary adds (ThagA.i.467) that, before his death, Sabbakámá requested the Brahmá Tissa (afterwards &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/me_mu/moggaliputta_tissa_th')"&gt;Moggaliputta Tissa&lt;/a&gt;) to see that the heresies, which were to arise in the time of&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/asoka')"&gt;Asoka&lt;/a&gt;, were put down.

Near his hut lived an Asura who from time to time listened to his preaching. One day the Asura saw a beautiful woman of Kási going with an escort to visit her parents. The Asura swooped down on the party and as soon as the men had fled, took the woman and made her his wife. For her safe protection he put her in a box, which he then swallowed. Some time later the Asura went to bathe, and having taken out the box and let the woman bathe, he allowed her to remain out until he himself had bathed. A son of Váyu, a magician, was travelling through the air, and the woman, seeing him, invited him to her box and there covered him up. The Asura, all unsuspecting, shut up the box and swallowed it. Then he visited the Bodhisatta who said in greeting, &quot;Welcome to all three of you.&quot; The Asura expressed his surprise, and the Bodhisatta explained the matter to him. The box was produced and the truth of his story proved. The magician went his way and the woman was allowed to go hers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related to a monk who was hankering after a woman (J.iii.527 31).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is also referred to (J.v.455) as the Karandaka Játaka.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Nigantha Nátaputta (Náthaputta)&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of six eminent teachers, contemporary with the Buddha; he is described as a heretic (aññatitthiya, E.g., S.i.66). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was leader of a sect known as the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/n/niganthaa')"&gt;Niganthá&lt;/a&gt;, and a summary of his teachings is found in the Sámaññaphala Sutta (D.i.57; DA.i.166). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Nigantha is restrained with a fourfold restraint (cátuyáma samvara)   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;he is restrained as regards all water, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;restrained as regards all evil, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;all evil has he washed away, and &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;he lives suffused with the sense of evil held at bay.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;And, because of this fourfold restraint, &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;he is called a Nigantha (free from bonds), &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;gatatta (one whose heart has been in the attainment of   his aim), &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;yattala (one whose heart is under command) and   &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;thitatta (one whose heart is fixed).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The meaning of this fourfold restraint is not clear; for a discussion of this cátuyáma samvara, see Barua: Pre-Buddhistic Indian Philosophy, pp. 378f. The first in evidently the well known rule of the Jains against drinking cold water, as it contains &quot;souls&quot; (cp. Mil.259ff). The Buddha taught a corresponding fourfold restraint, which consisted of observing the four precepts against injury, stealing, unchastity and lying (D.iii.48f.) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nátaputta is also stated (*1) to have claimed omniscience -  to be all-knowing, all seeing, to have all comprising (aparisesa) knowledge and vision. &quot;Whether I walk or stand or sleep or wake,&quot; he is mentioned as saying, </data>
<data>&quot;my knowledge and vision are always, and without a break, present before me.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;(*1) E.g., M.ii.31; A.i.220; M.i.92f.;also M.ii.214ff.   It is curious, in view of this statement of Nátaputta's doctrine of inaction,   that the main ground on which he is stated to have objected to Siha's visit to   the Buddha, was that the Buddha was an akíriyavádí (A.iv.180).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;He taught that past deeds should be extirpated by severe austerities, fresh deeds should be avoided by inaction. By expelling through penance all past misdeeds and by not committing fresh misdeeds, the future became cleared. From the destruction of deeds results the destruction of dukkha; this leads to the destruction of vedaná. Thus all dukkha is exhausted and one passes beyond (the round of existence). It is said* that Nátaputta did not employ the term kamma in his teaching; he used, instead, the word danda; and that, according to him, the danda of deed was far more criminal than the dandas of word and mind. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;* M.i.371. Danda probably means sins or hurtful acts.   Buddhaghosa says (MA.ii.595ff.) that the Jain idea was that citta (the   manodanda) did not come into bodily acts or into words   which were   irresponsible and mechanical, like the stirring and sighing of boughs in the   wind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is said to have shown no hesitation in declaring the destinies of his disciples after death (S.iv.398); but Sakuludáyi says (M.ii.31; also ibid., i.93; and ii.214f.; the Niganthas admit they did not know of the past) that when asked a question as to the past, he skipped from one matter to another and dismissed the question, evincing irritation, bad temper and resentment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only one discussion is recorded between Nátaputta and a </data>
<data>follower of the Buddha, and that was with Citta gahapati at Macchiká Sanda (S.iv.298ff). He praises Citta at the outset of the discussion, holding him up as an example to his own flock, and agreeing with Citta that knowledge is more excellent than faith. But later, when Citta claims knowledge of the four jhánas, Nátaputta is represented as condemning him for a deceitful man. Citta, thereupon, asks him ten questions and, getting no answer, leaves him. The Commentary (SA.iii.99) explains that the questions Citta asked were the same as the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kumaarapanha')"&gt;Kumárapañhá&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Devadaha Sutta (M.ii.214; cp. Cúlla Dukkhakkhandha Sutta; M.i.91ff.;   also A.v.150; D.iii.119), contains a detailed analysis and attributed to the Buddha, of the beliefs and teachings of the Niganthas. He there selects for his condemnation ten of their operative utterances, major and minor, and proves that the efforts and strivings of the Niganthas are fruitless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nátaputta is said (DhA.iii.201) to have claimed miraculous powers, but he did not, in fact, possess them. When, for instance, the Rájagaha-setthi offered his bowl of red sandal wood to anybody who could remove it from its perch, Nátaputta tried to obtain it by a ruse, but was unable to deceive the setthi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The books contain the names of several disciples of Nátaputta, among them a deva called Ninka (S.i.66; the Buddha's own paternal uncle, Vappa, was a follower of the Niganthas). Nátaputta is so convinced of the truth and the irrefutableness of his own doctrines, that he actually encourages his disciples to hold discussions with the Buddha. Some, like Dígha Tapassí, come away unscathed, without having carried the discussion to any conclusion; others are mentioned as being convinced by the Buddha in the end and as becoming his disciples. Such, for instance, are Asibandhakaputta (S.iv.317ff) and </data>
<data>Abhayarájakumára (M.i.392ff). Nátaputta tries, without success, to dissuade Síha, general of the Licchavis, from visiting the Buddha (A.iv.180ff). Síha goes and is converted. The next day he holds an almsgiving, on a grand scale, to the Buddha and his monks, at which flesh is served. It is said that Nátaputta went about Vesáli, sneering at the Buddha for encouraging slaughter. The Buddha, hearing of this, relates the Telováda Játaka (J.ii.262f.; Vin.i.233ff), to show that in the past, too, Nátaputta had sneered at him for a similar reason. Nátaputta is identified with the rich man of the Játaka. In the Báveru Játaka (J.iii.126f) he is identified with the crow who lost all his honour and glory when approached by the peacock, who was the Bodhisatta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the greatest blow to Nátaputta was when Upáli-gahapati (M.i.373ff) joined the Buddha. Nátaputta had allowed Upáli to visit him in spite of the warning of Dígha-Tapassí as to the Buddha's arresting personality. But Nátaputta thought Upáli would be proof against it, and, on hearing that he had renounced his allegiance to the Niganthas, refused to believe it until he could verify the information himself. The discovery of the apostasy of Upáli prostrated him with grief; he vomited hot blood and had to be carried away on a litter from Bálaka, where he was then living, to Pává. There, soon after, he died, and immediately great dissensions arose among his followers. When the Buddha heard of the quarrels, he remarked that it was only to be expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Ibid., ii.243f.; D.iii.117, 210; it is stated that the quarrel was deliberately fostered by Nátaputta before his death. See Niganthá).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nigantha Nátaputta is the name by which the Jaina teacher, Mahávíra, was known to his contemporaries. He was also called Vardhamána. Náta (or Náya) was the name of his clan (SNA. (ii.423) says Náta was the name of his </data>
<data>father), which belonged to Vesáli. According to Jaina tradition, his father's personal name was Siddhatha, and he was a Ksatriya, his mother being Trisálá. (For an account of Mahivira's life and philosophy, see Barua: op. cit.,  pp.372ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Nirodha Sutta&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sáriputta tells the monks that one, who has achieved virtue, concentration and insight, may both enter the cessation of perception and feeling and also emerge there from. Udáyin (Láludáyí), who is present, contradicts this three times, but none upbraids him. Sáriputta's words are repeated before the Buddha, and Udáyin acts similarly. The Buddha rebukes Ananda for not admonishing Udáyin. Later, the Buddha talks of the matter to Upavána and tells him of five qualities which a monk should possess.

The tree was shady and beautiful to look upon.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The road northwards (to Uttarakuru?) went past this tree (Ibid.,184).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Nágasamála Thera&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was a &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sakya')"&gt;Sákiyan&lt;/a&gt; and entered the Order when the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddha')"&gt;Buddha&lt;/a&gt; visited his kinsmen at &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kapilavatthu')"&gt;Kapilavatthu&lt;/a&gt;. For some time he was the Buddha's personal attendant -  e.g., when the Buddha breached the&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahasihanada_s')"&gt;Mahásihanáda Sutta&lt;/a&gt; (or the Lomahamsa-pariyáya) (M.i.83 ; MA.i.283; AA.i.163; UdA. 217; J.iv.95).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One day, when entering the city for alms, he saw a nautch girl gaily dressed, dancing to the accompaniment of music and contemplated her as the snare of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/maara')"&gt;Mára&lt;/a&gt;. Making this his topic of thought, he developed insight into the perishable ness of life and became an arahant (Thag.vs.267 70; ThagA.i.378). Another day (evidently earlier than the previous incident), while walking with the Buddha, they came to a cleft in the road, and the Buddha wished to go along one way, while Nágasamála wished to go along another, in spite of the Buddha's warning that it was dangerous. In the end, he put the Buddha's begging bowl and robe on the ground and left him. Brigands waylaid him and ill treated him, breaking his bowl and threatening to kill him. Thereupon he turned back to the Buddha and asked his forgiveness (Ud.viii.7; UdA.425f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nágasamála was a householder in the time of Padumuttara Buddha, and, seeing the Buddha walking in the sun, he gave him an umbrella. After that, wherever he went a white parasol appeared over his head. For thirty kappas he was king of the gods. He is probably to be identified with Ekachattiya of the Apadana. Ap.ii.405&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;2. Nágasamála Thera&lt;/h4&gt;</data>
<data>&lt;p&gt;An arahant. The Apadana (Ap.i.119) distinguishes him from the above, whom it calls Ekachattiya. Thirty one kappas ago he placed a pátali flower on the thupa of Sikhí Buddha. Fifteen kappas ago he was a king named Bhúmiya.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Apadana Commentary says, however, that this thera was the pacchásamana (personal attendant) of the Buddha for some time and that he was called Nágasamála because his body was tender as nágabuds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

It was the birthplace of Upaka (Thig.294; ThigA.225).

He pleaded poverty, gave them his robe and escaped. In the city lived his father's former chaplain who had been dismissed. He told his wife how, as he watched the stars that night, he had seen the king fall into hostile hands and then escape. The king heard all this in the course of his wanderings and the following morning sent for his astrologers. They had not observed any such thing in the stars. He dismissed them therefore, appointed the other in their place, and gave him a boon. When the chaplain went home to consult his family as to what boon he should beg, his wife, his son Chatta, and his slave &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pu/punnaa')"&gt;Punná&lt;/a&gt;, each wanted something different. He reported this to the king, who gave to each what he had desired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The circumstances leading to the story are given in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/j/junha_jat_456')"&gt;Junha Játaka&lt;/a&gt;.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Niddesa&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A commentarial work included in the Canon as part of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/khuddaka_n')"&gt;Khuddaka Nikáya&lt;/a&gt;. It is generally divided into two books: the Culla-Niddesa and the Mahá Niddesa. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Culla Niddesa contains comments on the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/khaggavisaana')"&gt;Khaggavisána Sutta&lt;/a&gt; and the sixteen suttas of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/parayana')"&gt;Paráyana Vagga&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/sutta_nipata')"&gt;Sutta Nipáta&lt;/a&gt;, while the Mahá Niddesa deals with the sixteen suttas of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/atthaka_s_v')"&gt;Atthaka Vagga&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is significant that the Culla Niddesa contains no comments on the fifty six (Vatthugáthá) introductory stanzas, which preface the Paráyana Vagga as at present found in the Sutta Nipáta. This lends support to the suggestion that at the time the Culla Niddesa was written the Paráyana Vagga, was a separate anthology, and that the Khaggavisána Sutta did not belong to any particular group. Similarly with the Mahá Niddesa and the Atthaka Vagga.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The comments in the Niddesa seem to have been modeled on exegetical explanations such as are attributed here and there in the Pitakas to Mahá Kaccána (E.g., Madhupindika Sutta (M.i.110f); also S.iii.9) and to Sáriputta (E.g., Sangití Sutta, D.iii.207f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a tradition (NidA. p.1), which ascribes the authorship of the Niddesa to Sáriputta. There exists a Commentary on it, called the Saddhammapajjotiká, by Upasena. It was written in Ceylon at the request of a monk called Deva Thera.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Once, when the Buddha was staying in a forest in Kosala, Navakammika, who was there seeing about some timber work, saw the Buddha at the foot of a tree and asked him what pleasure he found in his contemplations. When the Buddha explained to him how he had found liberty, the Brahmin was pleased and accepted the Buddha as his teacher (S.i.179).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commentary (SA.i.205) explains that this Brahmin had forest trees cut, and out of the timber had the framework for gables, roof terraces, etc., fitted, and these were then carried to the town and sold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

When quite young, he was given to a Brahmin, who fed him on delicacies and looked after him. When Nandi grew up, in order to show his gratitude to the Brahmin, he suggested that he should draw one hundred carts for a wager. The Brahmin boasted to his friends and had a wager with them. On the appointed day he loaded one hundred carts, lashed them together, and having tied Nandivisala to the first, took his seat on the pole and, flourishing his goad, shouted, &quot;Now, you rascal, pull.&quot; The bull, very offended, would not stir, and the Brahmin lost his money. As he lay groaning in bed, Nandivisala went to him and said that he should not have abused him. He then asked him to wager two thousand, and said that this time he would win. This the Brahmin did, and the next day, having tied one hundred carts together, he yoked Nandivisala to the frat and stroked his back saying, &quot;Now then, my fine fellow, pull.&quot; With one heave, Nandivisala pulled the carts, and the last stood where the first had been. Nandivisala's master received many presents in addition to the wager.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related in reference to the taunts uttered by the Chabbaggiyas against the virtuous monks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ananda was the brahmin of the story (J.i.191ff.; the story is also given at Vin.iv.5). It was also related in connection with the Yamakapátiháriya. DhA.iii.213.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

The village received its name from the Nalakapána pokkharani (MA.ii.66 4f.; AA.ii.813). The reason for the name of this pond, which was in the village, is given in the Nalapána Jataka. There were two groves near the village, the Ketakavana and the Palásavana; in the latter, Sáriputta preached two sermons at the request of the Buddha. A.v.122f., 125 f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;1. Nalakapána Sutta&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preached at the Palásavana in Nalakapána. The Buddha asks the assembled monks   among whom are many distinguished members, such as Anuruddha, Kimbíla, Nandiya and others - if they feel they have realized the aim for which they have given up household life? On their assenting, he proceeds to tell them that when he claims that he has destroyed the ásavas and that his disciples have gained various attainments through his teaching, he does so, not in order to cajole or to delude others, nor to gain fame and profit for himself, but to hearten and fill with enthusiasm believing young men, that they may concentrate with their whole hearts and follow the example of his disciples. M.i.462ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;2. Nalakapána Sutta&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha, having preached to the monks in Palásavana in Nalakapána till late at night, asks Sáriputta to continue, as he has pain in his back and wishes to rest. Sáriputta thereupon takes up the sermon and tells the monks of the necessity for saddhá, hiri, ottappa, viriya and paññá, for the performance of good works. The Buddha returns and praises Sáriputta. A.v.122ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;3. Nalakapána Sutta&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The circumstances are the same as in (2), but the </data>

Kassapa II. found the buildings dilapidated, and, during their restoration, he persuaded the Elder to live in a large pásáda attached to the Maricavatti vihara.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Elder was proficient in the Abhidhamma, and the king caused the Abhidhamma and the Commentaries to be recited by him. The village of Mahánitthula was given to him for his maintenance (Cv.xliv.149ff.; xlv.2). Nágasálá was also the residence of Dáthásiva (Ibid.xlvi.6). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A parivena, called the Nágasála parivena, was built by Aggabodhi, ruler of Malaya and minister to the king, in the reign of Sena III., who gave a village for its maintenance (Ibid.,liii.36).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Ilanága restored it and bestowed land for its maintenance (Ibid.,xxxv.31; MT.469). A story is related of a monk of this vihára who cut down a nága tree near the monastery. The devatá living in the tree was annoyed, and announced to the Thera that the king who looked after him would die in seven days. The Thera mentioned this in the palace; seven days passed and, as nothing happened. The king had the Thera's hands and feet cut off (VibhA.407). Near the monastery was a village named Kelakacchagáma (c.l. Kálagacchagáma) (MA.ii.1025). Dappula gave the village of Kevattagambhíra to the vihára (Cv.x1v.58).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Nigrodháráma&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;A grove near Kapilavatthu, where a residence was provided for the Buddha when he visited the city in the first year after his Enlightenment (MA.i.289). It belonged to a Sákyan named Nigrodha, who gave it to the Order. In order to convince his proud kinsmen of his attainments, the Buddha performed there the Yamakapátiháriya, and when, at the conclusion of the miracle' a shower of rain fell, wetting only those who wished to be wetted, he related to them the Vessantara Játaka (Vin.i.82; J.i.88f.;vi.479; BuA.22; DhA.iii.163; also Mtu.iii.101, 107, 114,138,141, 179). It wa's during this visit that Mahápajápati Gotamí first asked permission for women to enter the Order. This was refused, and from there the Buddha went on to Vesáli (Vin.ii.253; A.iv.274). The Buddha stayed at the Nigrodháráma on several other occasions, and several Vinaya rules are mentioned as being first promulgated there (E.g., Vin.iii.235, 244; iv.55, 101, 167, 181, 262, 314). Various Sákyans came to see the Buddha at the Nigrodh,áráma, among them, Mahánáma, Godha, Sarakáni, Nandiya and Vappa (S.v.369 78; 395 7, 403 4, 408; A.ii.196; iii.284; iv.220; v. 83, 328, 332, 334). The Buddha himself visited Káligodhá during his residence there. It was during a discussion with Mahánáma that the Cula Dukkhakkhandha Sutta (q.v.) was preached. During one of the Buddha's residences in Nigrodháráma, the Sákyans invited him to consecrate their new Mote Hall, which he did by preaching there far into the night and then asking Moggallána to continue his discourse (S.iv.182ff.; also M.i.353, Sekha Sutta). On another occasion the Buddha is mentioned as having spent a period of convalescence at Nigrodháráma (A.i.219f ); he was there also when the quarrel broke out between the Sákyans and the </data>
<data>Koliyans regarding the water of the Rohiní (SNA.i.357; but see J.v.413, where he is said to have been in Sávatthi). It seems to have been the Buddha's custom, when staying at Nigrodháráma, sometimes to spend the noonday siesta in the Mahávana near by (E.g., S.iii.91f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among others mentioned as having stayed at Nigrodháráma are Anuruddha (DhA.iii.295) and Lomasakangiya. M.iii.200; a deva called Candana there taught him the Bhaddekaratta, Sutta. Is this Lomasakangíya the same as Lomavangísa, who is also mentioned (S.v.327) as having lived in Nigrodháráma?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Near Nigrodháráma was once the site of the dwelling of a hermit (isi) called Kanha. The Buddha, remembering this, once smiled, and, when asked the reason for his smile, related the Kanha Játaka (J.iv.6).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a tradition (CypA.1,7; BuA.3) that the Cariyá Pitaka and the Buddhavamsa were preached by the Buddha to Sáriputta during his first stay in Nigrodháráma. It was probably there that Anuruddha's sister built, at his request, an assembly hall of two storeys for the Sangha (DhA.iii.295f). Buddhaghosa says (MA.ii.906; M.iii.109f ) that Kála Khemaka, the Sákyan, built a special vihára near Nigrodháráma, on one side of the grounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;2. Nigrodháráma&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;A grove in Rájagaha. The Buddha says that there he once gave Ananda the chance of asking him to live for a whole aeon, but Ananda missed his opportunity.

In order that the son might not be deprived of his wealth, the old squire took his slave Nanda into his confidence and buried the money, charging Nanda to deliver it to his son after his death. The old man died and, at his mother's suggestion, the son asked Nanda to show him where the wealth was buried. Nanda took him to the place in the forest, but as soon as he started digging, the thought of being able to get the money for himself so elated him that he started abusing his master. The young man pretended not to hear, and said they would go some other time. Several times the same thing happened, and at last the son decided to consult his father's friend, the Bodhisatta. The latter told him to note where Nanda started digging, and then to dig there himself and so get the treasure. This he did and found the money, which he made Nanda carry home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related in reference to a co resident of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/saariputta')"&gt;Sariputta&lt;/a&gt;.

Thereupon knowledge arose in him and insight. Just as, when a man, faring through a forest, comes upon an ancient city and announces his discovery to the king, who has the city restored, so did the Buddha see the ancient path traversed by the Enlightened Ones of the past and declare it to many, to devas and to men.

Unlike the Acelakas, they wore one garment, a covering in front. But when praised for their modesty, they answered that their reason for wearing a garment was to prevent dust and dirt from falling into their alms dishes. For even dust and dirt are actual individuals and endowed with the principle of life (DhA.iii.489). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chief precepts of the Niganthá are included in the cátuyámasamvara -  the fourfold restraint (for their beliefs and practices see &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/n/nigantha_nataputta')"&gt;Nigantha Nátaputta&lt;/a&gt;). The chief centres of the Niganthas, in the time of the Buddha, seem to have been &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/vesaali')"&gt;Vesáli&lt;/a&gt; (e.g., J.iii.1; M.i.228) and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/n/naalandaa')"&gt;Nálandá&lt;/a&gt; (M.i.371), though they had settlements in other important towns, such as &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/r/raajagaha')"&gt;Rájagaha&lt;/a&gt; (e.g., at Kálasilá, on the slopes of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/i_/isigili')"&gt;Isigili&lt;/a&gt;, M.i.92). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chief patrons of the Buddha's time were: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Síhasenápati in &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/vesaali')"&gt;Vesáli&lt;/a&gt;,  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Upaligahapati in Nálandá and  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Vappa the Sakyan in   Kapilavatthu (AA.ii.751).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The books contain several names besides that of Nátaputta of distinguished members of the Nigantha Order -   e.g., Dígha-Tapassí, and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/saccaka')"&gt;Saccaka&lt;/a&gt;, and also of several women, Saccá, Lolá, Avavádaká and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/patacara')"&gt;Patácárá&lt;/a&gt; (J.iii.1). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lay followers of the Niganthas wore white garments </data>
<data>(M.ii.244).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Chalabhijáti classification of Púrana Kassapa, the Ekasátaka-Niganthas occupied the third rank, the red (A.iii.384). The Buddha condemned the Niganthas as unworthy in ten respects:  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;  &lt;li&gt;they were without faith,  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;unrighteous,  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;without fear and shame,  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;they chose wicked men as friends,  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;extolled themselves and disparaged others,  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;were greedy of present gain, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;obstinate, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;untrustworthy,  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;sinful in their thoughts,  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;and held wrong views (A.v.150).  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their fast resembled a herdsman looking after the kine by day, which were restored to their owners at eventide (Ibid., i.205f). The Niganthas were so called because they claimed to be free from all bonds (amhákam ganthanakileso palibujjhanakileso natthi, kilesaganthirahitá mayan ti evam váditáya laddhanámavasena Nigantho) (E.g., MA.i.423). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddhist books record (M.ii.243f.; D.iii.117, 210) that there was great dissension among the Niganthas after the death of Nátaputta at Pává. The Commentaries state (DA.iii.906; MA.ii.831) that Nátaputta, realizing on his death bed the folly and futility of his teaching, wished his followers to accept the Buddha's teaching In order to bring this about, he taught his doctrine in two different ways to two different pupils, just before his death. To the one he said that his teaching was Nihilism (uccheda), and to the other that it was Eternalism (sassata). As a result, they quarrelled violently among themselves, and the Order broke up. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That the Niganthas lasted till, at least, the time of Nágasena, is admitted (Mil.p.4) by the fact that Milinda, was asked to consult a </data>
<data>teacher called Nigantha Nátaputta, who, if at all historical, was probably the direct successor to the teacher of the same name, contemporary with the Buddha. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is evidence in the Játakas to show that the Nigantha Order was in existence prior to the life of the Buddha. Saccatapáví, mentioned in the Kunála Játaka (J.v.427), is described as a setasamaní, and may well have belonged to the Order of the Svetambaras, while in the Mahábodhi Játaka (J.v.246) mention is made of a teacher who is identified with Nigantha Nátaputta himself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There seems to have been a settlement of Niganthas in Ceylon from very early times. When Pandukábhaya laid out the city of Anurádhapura, he built also hermitages for several Niganthas  -  Jotiya, Giri and Kumbhanda (Mhv.x.97f). These continued to be inhabited even after the establishment of Buddhism in the Island, for we hear of them in the reign of Vattagámaní (circa 44 A.C.). When Vattagámaní pulled down the residence of the Nigantha Giri, because of his disloyalty to the king, he built on its site the Abhayagiri vihára. (Ibid., xxxiii.42f.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

When he returned he found that thieves had eaten the cow, leaving only the hide and the tail. Disgusted that the Lord of Fire could not even guard his own possessions, he put out the fire and became a recluse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related in reference to a question as to whether the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/aa/aajiivakaa')"&gt;Ajivikas&lt;/a&gt; -  some of whom lived behind &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/j/jetavana')"&gt;Jetavana&lt;/a&gt;   obtained any merit through the practice of their difficult penances.

His son married a rich merchant's daughter, but she, because she was barren, lost favour. Thereupon she pretended to be with child, and when her time drew near, she journeyed to her home with an old nurse who was in the secret. On the way she found a child deserted by its mother, and, greatly rejoicing, she claimed it as her own. The child was the Bodhisatta and was called Nigrodha. His father found for him two companions: Sakhá, son of a merchant, and Pottika, son of a tailor.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These three grew up together and were educated in Takkasilá. In the course of their travels, while his companions lay sleeping, Pottika heard a cock say that whoever ate its fat would become king, the flesh of its body commander in chief, and the flesh near its bone's treasurer. Pottika killed the cock, gave to Nigrodha the fat, to Sákha the flesh of the body, while he himself ate the flesh near the bones. Immediately after, men, in search of a successor to the throne of Benares chose Nigrodha, while the others accompanied him as commander in chief and treasurer. One day Nigrodha, wishing to have his parents near him, sent Pottika to fetch them from Rájagaha. On the way back he called at Sákha's house, but Sákha, who had a grievance against him for having given the cock's fat to Nigrodha, insulted him. When Pottika reported this to Nigrodha, he wished to have Sákha killed, but Pottika intervened on his behalf.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related in reference to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/devadatta')"&gt;Devadatta's&lt;/a&gt; ingratitude.

He was lazy and indolent, but the Buddha, discerning his antecedents, admonished him, and Nita, developing insight, became an arahant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Padumuttara Buddha he was a brahmin teacher named Sunanda.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One day, as he prepared a Vájapeyya sacrifice, the Buddha visited him and walked through the air above him.

They were declared by &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pu/purana_kassapa')"&gt;Purana Kassapa&lt;/a&gt;, in his classification of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/chalabhijaatiya_s')"&gt;chalabhijátas&lt;/a&gt;, to be paramasukkabhijatas. (A.iii.384; DA.i.162; SNA.i.372, etc.; but see MA.ii.632, where they rank lower than the Ajivakas, who are there considered as the parama sukkkábhijátas.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There seems to be some uncertainty as to Nanda's name.

Once the Bodhisatta was born as king of the deer and was called Nigrodha. With him was the leader of another herd, and he was called Sákha. There was an agreement between these two leaders that, on alternate days, a deer from their herd should offer itself to be killed by the king of Benares. One day the turn fell on a pregnant doe of Sákha's herd, and when she asked to be allowed to wait until she had brought forth her young she was refused by Sákha. She then appealed to Nigrodha, who took her turn on himself. Immunity had been granted to Nigrodha, and when his act was reported to the king, he came in person to enquire into the matter. On hearing the story, he was greatly moved, and promised immunity both to Nigrodha and the doe. But Nigrodha was not satisfied till the king promised immunity to all living beings. Later, on discovering that the deer, taking advantage of this, were destroying men's crops, Nigrodha, gave orders to his herd to refrain from doing so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related in reference to the mother of Kumára Kassapa (q.v.). She had joined the Order under Devadatta not knowing that she was pregnant. On discovering her condition, Devadatta expelled her from the Order. She appealed to the Buddha, who caused an enquiry to be held, and, having been assured of her innocence, he restored her to all honour. When Kumára Kassapa was born he, too, was admitted to the Order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Devadatta is identified with Sákha, Kumára Kassapa with the doe's young one, his mother with the doe, and the king with Ananda. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;J.i.145ff.; DhA.iii.148f. The story is figured in the Bharhut Stupa (Cunningham: pl. xxv. (1) and xliii. (2). It is given in Mtu. (i.359ff.) with several variations in detail.&lt;/p&gt;</data>

The king of Kosala was very fond of hunting, and his subjects, that they might be left in peace, planned to drive deer from the forest into a closed park where the king might hunt. Nandiya, seeing the men come, left his parents in the thicket and joined the deer who were being driven into the park so that his parents might not be seen. The deer agreed each to take his turn in being killed by the king. The Bodhisatta stayed on even in spite of a message brought by a Brahmin from his parents   though he could have escaped. But he wished to show his gratitude to the king who had supplied the deer with food and drink. When his turn came to be killed, he appeared fearlessly before the king, and by the power of his virtue the king's bow refused to shoot. The king thereupon realized Nandiya's goodness and granted him a boon. Nandiya asked for security for all living beings, and established the king in the path of virtue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related in reference to a monk who was blamed for looking after his parents. But the Buddha praised him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The king of the story was Ananda, and the Brahmin who brought the message was Sáriputta. J.iii.270ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

J.iii.143ff., 362; DhA.i.344.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;6. Nárada&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;A sage, younger brother of Káladevala and pupil of Jotipála (Sarabhanga). He lived in the Majjhimapadesa in Arañjaragiri. He became enamoured of a courtesan, and was saved only through the intervention of Sarabhanga. For details see the Indriya Jataka. J.iii.463ff.; v.133f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;7. Nárada&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;An ascetic, son of the ascetic Kassapa. He was tempted by a maiden fleeing from brigands, but his father came to his rescue. For details see the Culla Nárada Játaka. J.iv.220ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;8. Nárada&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;King of Mithilá, seventh in direct descent from Sádhina. He is identified with Ananda. For details see the Sádhína Játaka. J.iv.355ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;9. Nárada&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;A brahmin sage, called a devabráhmana, and Náradadeva. One day, having wandered about in Távatimsa, he was returning to his dwelling in </data>
<data>Kañcanaguhá holding a Páricchattaka flower over his head, when the four daughters of Sakka -  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Ásá, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Saddhá, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Sirí and &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Hirí &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;-  asked him to give it to them. He agreed to give it to that one among them whom they should choose as their queen. They sought the advice of their father, who directed them to Macchariya Kosiya. Kosiya decided in favour of Hirí. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nárada is identified with Sáriputta. For details see the Sudhábhojana Jataka (J.v.392ff). It is probably this same Nárada who is mentioned as being present when Kunála (q.v.) delivered his famous diatribe against women. He is described as possessing the pañcábhiññá and as being attended by ten thousand ascetics. When Kunála had finished his discourse, Nárada supplemented it with all he knew of the vices of women (Ibid.,424, 450ff., 456). He is also mentioned as having admonished Mahájanaka when the latter renounced the world. In that context, Nárada is described as belonging to the Kassapa gotta. J.vi.56, 58, 68. In SNA.i.359 he is called Nárada Devala. This may be a wrong reading for Náradadeva.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;10. Nárada&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bodhisatta born as a Mahá Brahma. He helped Rujá to convince her father, Angati, of the truth as declared by her. He came down to earth and frightened Angati by revealing to him the horrors of hell. In this context he is described as belonging to the Kassapa gotta. For details see the Mahánáradakassapa Jataka. J.vi.220, 242 ff.; Ap.ii.483.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;11. Nárada&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;A celebrated physician, probably identical with the famous sage, No. 9, above. Mil.272.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;12. Nárada&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fifth future Buddha. Anágat. p. 40.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
<data>&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;13. Nárada&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Thera, mentioned once as staying at the Ghositáráma in Kosambí, with Músila, Savittha, and Ananda. In the course of discussion he declares that, though aware of the nature of nibbana, he is not an arahant (S.ii.115f). Elsewhere (A.iii.57f) he is mentioned as staying in the Kukkutáráma in Pátaliputta. At that time King Munda was grieving over the death of his wife,  Bhaddá, to the neglect of everything else, and his treasurer, Piyaka, suggested that he should visit Nárada. The king agreed, and Nárada preached to him on the inevitable ness of old age, disease, death, etc. Munda was consoled, and buried the body of his wife, which he had till then preserved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He may be identical with the Thera mentioned in the Peta Vatthu Commentary (PvA.2, 10, 11, 14, 204, 208, 210, 211) as finding out from various petas the stories of their deeds, and in the Vimána Vatthu Commentary (VvA.165, 169, 203) as visiting various vimánas in the course of his wanderings among the deva worlds (devacáriká). He is stated as having repeated the stories he learnt to the dhammasangáhakas to be embodied in their rescensions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;14. Nárada&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bodhisatta born as an ascetic.

Nárada&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Yakkha who presided over Náradakúta. Offerings, which included a man from each village, were brought to him once a year. Dípankara Buddha visited him and, after performing many miracles, converted him. He, with ten thousand other Yakkhas, became a sotápanna. Bu.ii.199; BuA.101.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;16.

(The Apadána (ii.499) says he belonged to a rich clan of merchants and that he entered the Order at the ceremony of dedication of Jetavana.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having entered the Order after hearing a sermon of the Buddha, he developed insight and soon attained arahantship. Once, at the Buddha's request, he preached a sermon to the nuns; on the first day they became sotápannas, and, on the second, five hundred of them attained arahantship. From that time the Buddha declared him foremost among exhorters of the nuns. [A.i.25. The sermon he preached is known as the Nandakovada Sutta (q.v.). The Anguttara Commentary (i.173) says that the nuns were Sakyan maidens who had entered the Order with Pajapati. At first Nandaka was reluctant to preach to them, they having been his wives in a previous birth when he was king, and he feared the calumny of his colleagues who might suggest that he wished to see his former companions. He, therefore, sent another monk in his place; but the Buddha, knowing that only Nanda's preaching would effect the nuns' release, insisted on his going.] &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Theragáthá (vs.279 82) contains several verses uttered by him to a woman to whom he was once married. She met him begging alms in Savatthi and smiled to him with sinful heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His aspiration after eminence was formed in the time of Padumuttara Buddha, when he heard a disciple of that Buddha declared foremost among exhorters of nuns. He offered the Buddha a very costly robe and illuminated his bodhi tree. In the time of Kakusandha Buddha he was a karavíka bird and delighted the Buddha with his song. Later, he was a peacock, and sang three times daily at the door of a Pacceka Buddha's cell. (ThagA. i.384f. The </data>
<data>Apadana verses given in this context differ from those given in the Apadana itself (ii 499 f.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Anguttara Nikaya attributes two discourses to Nandaka. The first (A.i.193f. See sv., Sálha) was preached at the Migáramátupasáda and takes the form of a discussion with Sálha, Migára's grandson, and Rohana, Pekkhuniya's grandson   on greed, covetousness, malice and delusion, and the benefits following their destruction. The second discourse is a sermon addressed to the monks at the waiting hall at Jetavana. It is said that the Buddha was attracted to the spot by the sound of Nandaka's preaching, and, finding the door locked, stood fur a long time outside, listening (A.iv.358ff.; throughout the three watches of the night says the Commentary, AA.ii.794; also MA.i.348). When his back began to ache he knocked at the door, and, having entered, told Nandaka that he had been waiting until the end of his discourse to speak to him. Nandaka expressed. his regret that he should have kept the Buddha waiting and pleaded ignorance of his presence. The Buddha, conscious of Nandaka's remorse, went on to praise his sermon, and said that the preaching of such sermons was the duty of all pious monks. When the Buddha left, Nandaka resumed his sermon, and told his audience of the five results of listening to the Dhamma in due season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Majjhima Commentary (ii.1019) states that Nandaka was once the leader of a guild of five hundred slaves of Benares and that Pajapati Gotami was his wife. One day, while fetching water, his wife noticed five hundred Pacceka Buddhas enter the city, and, on her return, she witnessed their departure. On enquiry, she learnt that they had applied to a merchant for lodgings for the rainy season, but that he had been unable to help. She undertook the care of them and, having enlisted the support of all her </data>
<data>companions and their husbands, she and her husband ministered to the Pacceka Buddhas. As a result, they were born together as man and wife for many births, as were their helpers. In one birth Nandaka was king, and all the women became his wives. In this birth, the women were born as Pajapati's companions, and they left the world in her company. To them was the Nandakovada Sutta preached.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;2. Nandaka Thera&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;A householder of Campá and younger brother of Bharata Thera. When these two heard that Sona Kolivisa had left the world   and he so delicate   they too renounced household life. Bharata soon acquired sixfold abhiññá, and, wishing to help Nandaka, came to him and discoursed on insight. A caravan passed by, and an ox, unable to pull his cart through a boggy place, fell down. The caravan leader had him released and fed with grass and water. He was then able to pull the cart out. Bharata drew Nandaka's attention to the incident, and the latter, making that his object of meditation, soon attained arahantship. (Thag.173f.; ThagA.i.299f.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Sikhí Buddha, Nandaka was a woodsman, and one day, while wandering about, he saw the Buddha's cloistered walk. Pleased with its appearance, he scattered sand over it. (Ap.ii.418)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;3. Nandaka&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;A yakkha. One day, while traveling through the air with his friend, he saw Sariputta sitting in samadhi, his head newly shaved. Ignoring his friend's warning, Nandaka knocked Sariputta oh the head; the former immediately fell down, his body aflame, and swallowed up in hell. (MA.ii.814; Mil.100; the incident is related at Ud.iv.4, UdA.244ff., and referred to in ThagA.ii.116, but the yakkha's name is not given. The blow was hard enough to kill an elephant seven or eight cubits high or shatter a rock. Sariputta was </data>

Nandaka&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;General of Pingala, king of Surattha, who reigned some two hundred years after the Buddha's death. Nandaka was a Nihilist, and, after death, was born as a vemámikapeta in the Vindhyá forest. His daughter, Uttará, was a pious woman, and gave alms in his name to an arahant monk. Thereupon Nandaka attained celestial happiness. Wishing to liberate Pingala from his Nihilist views, Nandaka waited for him on his return from a conference with Dhammásoka, and, having led the king to his abode, ministered to him. Then, revealing his identity, Nandaka advised the king to follow the Buddha's teaching. Pv.iv.3; PvA.244ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;1. Nandaka Sutta&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Records the incident of the Buddha listening to the preaching of Nandaka and the continuation of Nandaka's sermon. See Nandaka (1). A.iv.358ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;2. Nandaka (or &lt;a name="Licchavi"&gt;Licchavi&lt;/a&gt;) Sutta&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nandaka, minister of the Licchavis, visits the Buddha at the Kútágárasálá in Vesali. The Buddha tells him that the Ariyan disciple, possessed of unwavering loyalty to the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha., and having Ariyan virtues, is assured of enlightenment and happiness. During the conversation, a man comes to tell Nandaka that his bath is ready. Nandaka sends him away, saying that the inner washing loyalty to the Buddha is far more important.

He was only a few days younger than the Buddha, and when the Buddha's mother died, Pajapati gave her own child to nurses and suckled the Buddha herself (AA.i.186). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the third day of the Buddha's visit to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kapilavatthu')"&gt;Kapilavatthu&lt;/a&gt;, after the Enlightenment, the Buddha went to Nanda's house, where festivities were in progress in honour of Nanda's coronation and marriage to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/j/janapadakalyaanii_nandaa')"&gt;Janapadakalyání Nandá&lt;/a&gt;. The Buddha wished Nanda good fortune and handed him his bowl to be taken to the vihára. Nanda, thereupon, accompanied the Buddha out of the palace. Janapadakalyání, seeing him go, asked him to return quickly. Once inside the vihára, however, the Buddha asked Nanda to become a monk, and he, unable to refuse the request, agreed with reluctance. But as the days passed he was tormented with thoughts of his beloved, and became very downcast and despondent, and his health suffered. The Buddha suggested that they should visit the Himálaya. On the way there, he showed Nanda the charred remains of a female monkey and asked him whether Janapadakalyání were more beautiful than that. The answer was in the affirmative. The Buddha then took him to Távatimsa where Sakka, with his most beautiful nymphs, waited on them. In answer to a question by the Buddha, Nanda admitted that these nymphs were far more attractive than Janapadakalyání, and the Buddha promised him one as wife if he would live the monastic life. Nanda was all eagerness and readily agreed. On their return to </data>
<data>Jetavana the Buddha related this story to the eighty chief disciples, and when they questioned Nanda, he felt greatly ashamed of his lustfulness. Summoning all his courage, he strove hard and, in no long time, attained arahantship. He thereupon came to the Buddha and absolved him from his promise. (Thag.157f.; J.i.91; ii.92ff.; Ud.iii.2; DhA.i.96 105; UdA.168ff.; SNA.273f.) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the Buddha was told of Nanda's arahantship by a devata, he related the Sangámávacara Jataka (q.v.) to show how, in the past, too, Nanda had been quick to follow advice. He also related the story of Kappata (q.v.) and his donkey to show that it was not the first time that Nanda had been won to obedience by the lure of the female sex. The male donkey in the story was Nanda and the female donkey Janapadakalyání. (DhA.i.103f.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nanda is identified with the sub king (uparájá) in the Kurudhamma Jataka (q.v.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later, on seeing how eminently Nanda was trained in self control, the Buddha declared him chief among his disciples in that respect (indriyesu guttadváránam). Nanda had aspired to this eminence in the time of Padumuttara Buddha. In the time of Atthadassi Buddha he was a tortoise in the river Vinatá, and, seeing the Buddha on the bank waiting to cross, he took him over to the other side on his back. (A.i.25; AA.i.174f.; ThagA.i.276ff.) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is said to have been called Nanda because his birth brought joy to his kinsmen. The Apadána (i.57) says he was of golden hue, as reward for a gift of a costly robe given by him to Padumuttara. One hundred thousand kappas ago he became king four times under the name of Cela. Sixty thousand kappas ago he was again king in four births, under the name of Upacela. Later, five thousand kappas ago, he was four times cakkavatti, and his name then, too, was Cela.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nanda was very beautiful, and was only four inches shorter </data>
<data>than the Buddha. He once wore a robe made according to the dimensions of the Buddha's robe. Discovering this, the Buddha chided him for his presumption. (Vin.iv.173; perhaps this is another version of the story found at S.ii.281. There, Nanda is said to have donned a robe which was pressed on both sides, painted his face, and gone to see the Buddha, carrying a bright bowl. The Buddha chided him, and Nanda thereupon became a forest dweller and a rag-robe-man. Buddhaghosa (SA.ii.174) says that Nanda dressed himself up in order to evoke some comment from the Buddha - either approval, so that he might dress thus for the remainder of his life, or censure, in which case he would put on rag robes and dwell in the forest.) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Anguttara Nikaya (A.iv.166f) contains a discourse in which the Buddha discusses Nanda's claim to have achieved self control in all things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is probably to be identified with Taraniya Thera of the Apadána. (ii.428; cp. ThagA.i.277.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;2. Nanda&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Called &lt;b&gt;Nanda mánava&lt;/b&gt;. One of the chief disciples of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bavari')"&gt;Bávarí&lt;/a&gt;; he visited the Buddha: His conversation with the Buddha is recorded in the&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/n/n1_nan')"&gt;Nanda mánavapucchá&lt;/a&gt;. Later, he became an arahant. SN.vs.1007, 1124.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;3. Nanda&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Called &lt;b&gt;Nanda-Gopálaka&lt;/b&gt;. He was a cowherd of Kosambi. One day he heard the Buddha preach to the monks, using as simile a log of wood   how, in certain circumstances, it finds its way direct to the sea   and how, similarly, a monk may reach nibbina. Nanda asked permission to join the Order. But the Buddha insisted that he should first return the cattle, for which he was responsible, to their owners. Nanda did so, and was then ordained, </data>
<data>becoming an arahant soon after. S.iv.181.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;4. Nanda Thera&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;An arahant. In the past he was once a hunter, and, while wandering in the forest, he saw a Pacceka Buddha named Anuruddha. He built for the Buddha a hut thatched with lotus flowers, and, having listened to the Buddha's preaching, became a monk. Soon after he fell ill, died, and was born in Tusita. He possessed the power of traveling through the air and of walking over the sea. In this birth he visited the Buddha and questioned him regarding the &quot;further shore.&quot; At the end of the conversation he became an arahant. Ap.ii.350f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is probably identical with No. 3 above. See DA.i.122, where Nanda Gopalaka's questions are given; these seem to correspond with Nanda Thera's questions about the &quot;further shore.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;5. Nanda&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;A herdsman of Anáthapindika, living in Sávatthi. He was rich and tended the king's cattle as well. He often, went to Anáthapindika's house with gifts, and there he saw and heard the Buddha. He invited the Buddha to his house, but his invitation was not accepted for some time, until his wisdom should be ripe. But at last the Buddha paid him a visit, lasting seven days, and Nanda entertained him and his monks with the choicest foods. On the seventh day the Buddha preached to him and he became a sotapanna. He accompanied the Buddha part of the way back to the vihára, but, on his return journey, was killed by a hunter's arrow. DhA.i.322f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;6. Nanda mánava&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;A former incarnation of Subhúti Thera (q.v.) in the time of Padumuttara Buddha. He was a mahásala Brahmin of Hamsavatí, and later became an ascetic at the head of forty four thousand Jatilas. After thirty thousand years, Padumuttara visited him in the forest, and, later, ten thousand of his </data>
<data>followers joined the Buddha. Nanda provided them all with seats made of heavenly flowers, the Buddha's being one league in height. Nanda stood by the Buddha for seven days, holding an umbrella made of flowers. Nanda and the rest of his disciples joined the Order, and all except Nanda became arahants, he being bore in the Brahma world after death. Later, for five hundred births he was a forest dweller living alone on Mount Nisabha in Himavá. He was king of the devas for eighty births. (Ap.i.67; ThagA.i.17f.; AA.i.124f.) He evidently belonged to the Kosiya gotta (Ap.i.67.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;7. Nanda&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;A disciple of a Pacceka Buddha named Sabbábhibhú. The Bodhisatta was then a drunkard, named Munáli, and abused Nanda. It was a result of this that Ciñcá slandered the Buddha (&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/g/gotama')"&gt;Gotama&lt;/a&gt;). Ap.i.299; UdA.264.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;8.

He belonged to a poor family, but, owing to his merit in having covered Kassapa Buddha's cetiya with a golden coverlet, he came to be crowned king of Benares. He had a kapparukkha, which provided him and his subjects with divine robes. With the help of his queen -  who became&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bhadda_kapilani_thi')"&gt;Bhaddakapilá&lt;/a&gt; in this life -  </data>

Nanda was away, quelling a frontier rebellion, at the time of their death. On his return, he gave over his kingdom to his eldest son and became an ascetic. Ap.ii.582; ThagA.ii.139ff.; SA.ii.140f.; the story is also found at PVA.73ff.; there it is said that Nanda was granted divine clothes because he had once given his shawl to a Pacceka Buddha for a robe; see also ThigA.72.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nanda's wealth was proverbial.

Nanda&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Brahmin, mentioned in the Milindapanha [p.101. This probably refers to the Brahmin Ananda (q.v.) who raped Upalavanná (DhA.ii.49); this is confirmed by MA.ii.814, where Uppalavanná's seducer is called Nanda mánavaka] as having been swallowed up by the earth for having insulted the Buddha and his disciples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;18.

Nanda Kumáputta Thera&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was born in Velukanoa in Avanti and his mother was Kuma. Having heard Sariputta preach, he entered the Order, visiting the Buddha later. From the Buddha he obtained a formula of meditation and became an arahant. (Thag.vs.36; ThagA.i.100) He had a friend named Sudanta (also called Vásula) who, too, became an arahant (Ibid.101). In the time of Vipassi Buddha, Nanda was an ascetic, and, having seen the Buddha in the royal park at Bandhumati, gave him oil to massage his feet. He is probably to be identified with Abbhañjanadáyaka of the Apadána. Ap.ii.456.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name="20-Nava-Nanda"&gt;20&lt;/a&gt;.

The last was killed by Candagutta with the help of Cánakka, and his throne was seized. The nine Nandas together reigned for twenty two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;21. Nanda&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were once two butchers named Nanda. One day they killed a cow, and the younger asked that he might take the head and the tail as he had many children.

Nandanavana&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chief of the parks in Távatimsa, where the inhabitants of Távatimsa, headed by Indra, go for their amusement.

It is said (E.g., J.i.49) that there is a Nandanavana in each deva world. The devas go there just before their death and disappear in the midst of their revels. Thus, the Bodhisatta went to Nandanavana in the Tusita world before his &quot;descent&quot; into Mahámáyás womb (J.i.50; see also J.vi.144). In Nandanavana is a lake called Nandana (J.ii.189) and evidently also a palace called Ekapundaríkavimána (MT.568). Nandanavana was so called because it awoke delight in the hearts of all who visited it (J.v.158). Sometimes ascetics, like Nárada (Ibid.,392), possessed of great iddhi-power, would spend their siesta in the shadow of the grove.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;2. Nandanavana&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;A park in Anurádhapura between the Mahámeghavana and the southern wall of the city. Mahinda preached there, to the assembled populace, the Bálapanita Sutta, the day after his arrival in Anurádhapura. Later, on successive days, he preached the Asívisúpama, the Anamatagga, the Khajjaníya, the Gomayapindí and the Dhammacakkappavattana Suttas. On the occasions of the preaching of these various suttas, thousands of people attained to various fruits of the Path, and, because the park was the first centre from which Mahinda radiated a knowledge of the Buddha's teaching' it came to be called the Jotivana, by which name it was known later.

When Vangísa questioned the Buddha as to the destiny of Kappa, the Buddha's answer was that he had completely passed away (Thag.vs.1263ff.; SN.vs.343ff). It is said (ThagA.ii.211; SNA.i.346) that Vangísa was away when Kappa died, and had also seen him sleeping with his hands curled up. This was unlike a khínásava, but, in Kappa's case, it was due to long continued habit. Vangísa, not knowing this, was assailed with doubts as to his teacher's attainments. Kappa was a viháragaruka   that is, he attached importance to keeping to his cell. When he came back from his alms rounds, he would enter his cell and not leave it again until evening or the next day. This caused disaffection in Vangísa’s heart, which the latter quelled by force of reasoning (S.i.186; SA.i.208).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Nigrodhakappa, Kappa was the thera's personal name, but the prefix Nigrodha was given because he attained arahantship at the foot of a nigrodha (banyan) tree.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Nálágiri&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;An elephant of the royal stalls at Rájagaha. Devadatta, after several vain attempts to kill the Buddha, obtained Ajátasattu's consent to use Nálagiri as a means of encompassing the Buddha's death. The elephant, he said, knows nothing of the Buddha's virtues and will have no hesitation in destroying him. Nálagiri was a fierce animal, and in order to increase his fierceness, Devadatta instructed his keeper to give him twice his usual amount of toddy. Proclamation was made, by the beating of drums, that the streets of the city should be cleared as Nálágiri would be let loose upon them. When the Buddha was informed of this and warned against going into the city for alms, he ignored the warning, and went into Rájagaha with the monks of the eighteen monasteries of the city. At the sight of Nálágiri all the people fled in terror. Ananda, seeing the elephant advancing towards the Buddha, went, in spite of the Buddha's orders to the contrary, and stood in front of the Buddha, who had to make use of his supernatural power to remove him from his place. Just then, a woman, carrying a child, saw the elephant coming and fled, in her terror dropping the child at the Buddha's feet. As the elephant was about to attack the child, the Buddha spoke to him, suffusing him with all the love at his command, and, stretching out his right hand, he stroked the animal's forehead. Thrilling with joy at the touch, Nálágiri sank on his knees before the Buddha, and the Buddha taught him the Dhamma. It is said that had the elephant not been a wild beast he would have become a sotápanna. Marvelling at the sight, the assembled populace threw all their ornaments on the elephant's body, covering it entirely, and henceforth the elephant was known as Dhanapála (Dhanapálaka). The Buddha returned to Veluvana, and that day, at eventide, preached the Cullahamsa Játaka </data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Nimi Jataka (No. 541)&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the Bodhisatta was born as the son of the king of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/me_mu/mithilaa')"&gt;Mithilá&lt;/a&gt;, in the Videha country. He was a rebirth of Makhádeva, who came down among men from the Brahma world in order to bring the number of his family, who renounced the world, up to eighty four thousand. And because the boy was born to round off the family, like the hoop of a chariot, he was called Nemi (&quot;hoop&quot;).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On his father's renunciation, he came to the throne and engaged himself and all his subjects in righteousness and generosity. Once, when doubt arose in his mind as to which was more fruitful -  holy life or giving alms  - Sakka himself appeared before him to answer and encourage him. His fame spread to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/t/taavatimsa')"&gt;Távatimsa&lt;/a&gt;, and when the gods desired to see him, Sakka sent his chariot, with Mátali, to fetch him. On the way to Távatimsa, Mátali showed the king various hells and heavens and the palaces of various gods and goddesses. Arriving at the Sudhammá Hall, Nimi discoursed to the assembled gods. After staying in Távatimsa for seven clays, he returned to Mithilá to tell his subjects what he had seen.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When, later, his barber told him of the appearance of the first white hair on his head, he, like all his predecessors, handed over the throne to his son and became an ascetic. His son, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kaalaarajanaka')"&gt;Kálárajanaka&lt;/a&gt;, was the last of the eighty four thousand kings of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/makhadeva')"&gt;Makhádeva's&lt;/a&gt; dynasty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told by the Buddha when he visited Mithilá. He smiled when he came to the site of Makhádeva's palace, and when asked why he smiled he related the Játaka.&lt;/p&gt;</data>

Itwas preached in reference to Sáriputta's habit when he was on tour of worshipping the direction in which his teacher, Assaji, lived. Others noticed this and said it was a relic of his old brahmanic habit of worshipping the different quarters. But the Buddha said there was no need of Sáriputta to do that, for even the devas themselves worshipped him. In the sutta the wise man is compared to a ship (nává) which takes many others across.

This process continuing for some time, the king realized that possessions bring sorrow and suffering. He thereupon renounced his sixteen thousand women, and reflecting on his renunciation, became a Pacceka Buddha, and joined three others, who had also become Pacceka Buddhas: Karandu, Naggaji and Dummukha.

A doe drank water in which his semen had fallen and conceived a son, whom he adopted and Named Isisinga. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Isisinga was a sage of such austerity that Sakka trembled at his power. In order to destroy his virtue, Sakka caused a drought in Kasi, lasting three years. When the inhabitants complained to the king, Sakka appeared before him and suggested that if the king's daughter, Naliniká, would seduce Isisinga and destroy his virtue, rain would fall. Naliniká was, accordingly, sent to the Himálaya and arrived in Isisinga's hut dressed in the ascetic's garb, when the Bodhisatta was absent. Pretending to have been wounded by a bear, she played on the simplicity of the guileless young man (much as Venus did on that of Adonis). Through her seductions his virtue was overcome and leis mystic meditation broken off. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Delighted with the outcome of his plot, Sakka caused rain to fall on Kasi, and Naliniká left the hermitage. When the Bodhisatta returned and heard of the visit of the youthful ascetic and of all that followed, he admonished Isisinga and warned him for the future. The story was told in reference to a monk who was seduced by the wife of his worldly days. Isisinga is identified with the monk and Naliniká with his wife. v.l. Nalini Játaka. (J.v.193 209.

The parents were anxious to give their daughter to their nephew, but he had joined the Order. Later, however, wishing to marry his cousin, he asked his teacher's permission to become a layman. The latter withheld his consent for some time, and, while he hesitated, the house in which the family lived fell down and they were all killed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two sons and the daughter were born among the bhumma devas and the parents became petas. The young monk's teacher showed them to him one day as he passed behind the monastery at Isipatana, and having heard their story from their own lips, the monk caused alms to be given in the name of the petas, and they were freed from their sufferings.

Nigrodha Thera&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;He belonged to an eminent brahmin family of Sávatthi. On the day of the dedication of Jetavana, he saw the majesty of the Buddha and entered the Order, becoming an arahant soon after. Eighteen kappas ago, in the time of Piyadassí Buddha, he left great riches and became an ascetic, dwelling in a sála grove. Once, seeing the Buddha wrapped in samádhi, he built a bower over him, and stood there with clasped hands until the Buddha awoke from his samádhi. Then, at the Buddha's wish, the Sangha too came to the sála grove, and in their presence the Buddha predicted the ascetic's future (ThagA.i.74f; Thag.21).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nigrodha is probably identical with Sálamandapiya of the </data>

J.i.88.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;6. Nigrodha&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Commonly known as Nigrodha sámanera. He was the son of Sumana, the eldest of Bimbisára's children, and his mother was Sumaná. When Asoka slew Sumana, his wife, who was with child, fled to a candála village, where the guardian deity of a nigrodha tree built her a hut. Here she gave birth to her son, whom she named after her benefactor. The chief candála looked after them. When Nigrodha was seven years old, the Thera Mahávaruna ordained him, and he became an arahant in the tonsure hall. One day, while walking near the palace, Asoka saw him and, because of their connection in a past life, was attracted by him. Nigrodha had been one of the three brothers who gave honey to a Pacceka Buddha in a past life (for the story see Asoka and Mhv.v.49ff). Nigrodha had called the Pacceka Buddha a candála, hence he was born in a candála village. Asoka invited Nigrodha to the palace and entertained him, and Nigrodha preached to him the Appamáda Vagga. The king was greatly pleased, and offered to give food daily at the palace to thirty two monks in Nigrodha's name. It was this visit of Nigrodha to Asoka which ultimately resulted in the conversion of the latter to the faith of the Buddha (for details see ibid., 37 72; Dpv.vi.34ff.; vii.12, 31; Sp.i.45ff). It is said (MA.ii.931) that Asoka paid great honour to Nigrodha throughout his life. Three times a day he sent to Nigrodha gifts of robes carried on the backs of elephants, with five hundred measures of perfume and five hundred caskets of garlands. All these Nigrodha </data>

A monk of Jetavana, seeing him clad in a loin cloth, carrying a plough on his shoulder, suggested to him that he should become a monk. He was ordained, and, at his teacher's suggestion, hung his loin cloth and plough on a tree near the monastery. He was called Napgalakula (ploughman) on account of his former calling. Whenever he felt discontented with monastic life, he would go to the tree and blame himself for his shamelessness in harbouring thoughts of returning to his former life. On being asked where he went, he would say &quot;to my teacher.&quot; One day he became an arahant, and when asked why he no longer went to his teacher, he answered that the need was no more. This was reported to the Buddha, who praised the monk for his self-admonition. DhA.iv.115 17.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

When the Buddha visited the village and stayed at Bhesakalávana, they went to see him. They immediately fell at his feet, calling him &quot;son&quot; and asking why he had been so long away. It is said that they had been the Bodhisatta's parents for five hundred births and his near relations for many more. The Buddha preached to them and they became sotápannas. The Buddha visited their village once more when they were old. They entertained him, telling of their devotion to each other in this life and asking for a teaching which should keep them likewise together in after-life. The Buddha referred to this in the assembly of the Sangha, declaring them to be the most intimate companions (vissásiká) among his disciples. (A.I.26, A.II.61f, AA.i.216f, 246; ii.514; SA.ii.182)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once, when Nakulapitá lay grievously ill, his wife noticed that he was fretful with anxiety. She assured him there was no need for anxiety on his part, either on behalf of her or his children. She spoke with such conviction that Nakulapitá regained his composure of mind and grew well. Later he visited the Buddha and told him of this, and was congratulated by the Buddha on having such an excellent wife. (A.III.295ff)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Samayutta Nikaya (S.3.1, S.4.116; A.IV.268) contains records of conversations between Nakulapitá and the Buddha. Both husband and wife are mentioned in lists of eminent disciples. (A.iii.465; A.iv.348).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is said that' Nakulapitá's desire for eminence was first conceived in the time of Padamuttara Buddha. He was then a householder of Hamsavati, and was present at an assembly where the Buddha declared someone to </data>
<data>be chief of the vissásikas. A.I.216.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Nakulapitá Vagga&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first chapter of the Khandha Samyutta. S.3.1-21.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;1. Nakulapitá Sutta&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nakulapitá visits the Buddha at Bhesakalávana and asks for a teaching to comfort him since he is now old and always ailing. The Buddha advises him to train his mind. Nakulapitá, then visits Sáiriputta and asks him to explain the Buddha's teaching on this point. Sáiputta explains in detail that training of the mind implies the getting rid of thoughts of self with regard to the khandhas. S.iii.1 ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;2. Nakulapitá Sutta&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nakulapitá visits the Buddha at Bhesakalávana and asks him why some beings are wholly set free in this very life, while others are not. This has to do with grasping, says the Buddha, and then proceeds to explain it. S. iv. 107, 116.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

He, wishing for a less ill omened name, consulted his teacher. The Bodhisatta suggested that Pápaka should travel and find a suitable name. He came back a wiser man, for he discovered that &quot;Jívakas&quot; died and that &quot;Dhanapálís&quot; grovelled in poverty   the name signified nothing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related in reference to a monk called Pápaka who wished to change his name.

He belonged to a Sákiyan family in Kapilavatthu and entered the Order after hearing the preaching of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/madhupindika_s')"&gt;Madhupindika Sutta&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Padumuttara Buddha he was a Brahmin, named Nárada, and uttered three stanzas in praise of the Buddha. He was once a king named Sumitta (Thag.vs.86; ThagA.i.183f). He is probably identical with Atthasandassaka of the Apadána (Ap.i.169).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;2.

He was the maternal uncle of the novice &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/siha')"&gt;Síha&lt;/a&gt;, who is said to have addressed him by the name of Kassapa, his gotta name. He was fat and, therefore, lazy; he got most of his work done by Síha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;3. Nágita Thera&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;A thera of Ceylon, author of the Saddasáratthajálini. Gv.p.74; Svd.vs.1249.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;1. Nágita Sutta&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once, when the Buddha went to Icchánangala, the brahmin householders there came, in large numbers, to pay him their respects and made great uproar outside. When Nágita, the Buddha's personal attendant at the time, told him the cause of the clamour, the Buddha replied that he had nothing to do with homage; his concern was with renunciation. He went on to state five inevitable things: whosoever eats and drinks must answer the calls of nature; whosoever loves is destined to sorrow and despair; whosoever dwells on the asubha must feel disgust for the subha; whosoever sees impermanence in the six spheres of contact feels disgust for contact; whosoever sees the rise and fall </data>
<data>in the five kinds of attachment, must feel disgust for attachment. A.iii.31ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;2. Nágita Sutta&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The circumstances are the same as those of No. 1. The Buddha tells Nágita that he is pleased with monks who do not live in the village, but who seek the forest and stave off gains and flattery, but to him the best is to walk on the highway unattached.

The first part of the sermon is a catechism, the second is more explanatory, and contains various similes illustrating the impermanence of the senses and of sense objects. The sermon ends with the seven bojjhangas. After the sermon the nuns visit the Buddha who, seeing that their minds are not quite ripe, asks Nandaka to repeat the sermon to them the next day. Nandaka does so, and their enlightenment is assured. M.iii.270ff.; cf. J.ii.392, where it says the nuns became arahants at the conclusion of the sermon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

One day, while flying homewards, they saw Mount Neru and settled down there. All the birds there looked golden by virtue of the lustre of the mountain, and no one paid honour to the Bodhisatta and big brother; so they flew away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related in reference to a monk of a frontier village. At first he was honoured by the people who, however, later, transferred their favours elsewhere. But the monk, though very unhappy, contrived to stay on.

After the Enlightenment, the Buddha lived under the Ajapála Nigrodha (q.v.) at Uruvelá, on the banks of this river. There Mára tempted him, and, later, Brahmá persuaded him to preach the Dhamma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vin.i.1ff.; SN.vs.425ff.; cp.

Before eating the food, he bathed in the ford called Suppatittha. Under the bed of the river lay the abode of the Nága king, Kála. There was a sála grove on the banks, where the Buddha spent the afternoon previous to the night of the Enlightenment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three explanations are given of the name: (1) Its waters are pleasant (nelam jalam assá ti = nelañjalá, the r being substituted for the l); (2) it has blue water (níla jaláyá ti vattabbe Nerañjaráyá ti vuttam); (3) it is just simply the name of the river.

Anuruddha, when residing in the Chaddantavana, used to pass by his dwelling, and the deva gave him milk rice with lotus honey. When Sivalí visited Gandhamádana with five hundred monks, the deva gave them milk rice one day and clarified butter the next.

Hoping to cure him, the Bodhisatta asked him to report anything which he saw.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One day the youth saw a snake, and on being asked by the Bodhisatta how it looked, he answered, &quot;like the shaft of a plough&quot; (nangalisa). The Bodhisatta thought the simile good, but when it was used again about an elephant, a sugar cane, molasses and even curds and milk, he realized that the boy was hopeless. The story was told in reference to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/l/laludayi_th')"&gt;Láludáyi&lt;/a&gt;, who never made an appropriate remark.

Near his walk lived a mongoose and a snake who were always quarrelling. He preached to them the virtues of amity and dispelled their suspicions of each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related to two of Pasenadi's officers, who were always quarrelling.

Nandiya Thera&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;He belonged to a Sákiyan family of Kapilavatthu, and was called Nandiya because his birth brought bliss. He left the world at the same time as Anuruddha, Kimbila and the others, and he soon attained arahantship. Thereafter he dwelt with his companions in the Pácínavamsamigadáya (Vin.i.350f. It was to them that the Upakkilesa Sutta was preached, M.iii.155. Later, they seem to have lived in the Gosingasálavana, M.i.205). It is said that Mars appeared before him in a terrible form, but Nandiya drove him away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Padumuttara Buddha, Nandiya built an altar of sandalwood at the Buddha's cetiya and held great celebrations. Fifteen kappas ago Nandiya was eight times born as king under the name of Samatta (Samagga) (Thag.25; ThagA.82f.) He is probably identical with Sapariváriya (q.v.) of the Apadána (i.172).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Mahávastu (iii.177) Nandiya (Nandika) was the son of Sukrodana.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was a special friend of Kimbila. ThagA.i.276.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;2. Nandiya&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Sakyan layman, evidently to be distinguished from the above. He visited the Buddha at the Nigrodháráma in Kapilavatthu and had a discussion with him on the different kinds of Ariyan disciple, the one who dwells in remissness and the one who is earnest (S.v.397ff.; see also p. 403). Later, when the Buddha returned to Sávatthi for the rainy season, Nandiya also went there, finding some business to do, and from time to time he visited the Buddha. At the end of the rains, when the Buddha and the monks were about to start on tour, Nandiya went to the Buddha and was taught the eleven conditions which lead to the destruction of evil. A.v.334ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>
<data>&lt;h4&gt;3. Nandiya&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;A householder of Benarea. He was very pious and looked after his parents. When they wished him to marry Revatí, he refused because she belonged to a family of unbelievers. But when Revatí offered to help Nandiya in all his work, he agreed and they were married. When Nandiya's parents died, leaving him very rich, he used the money to feed the poor and needy. Later he built a quadruple hall in the great monastery at Isipatana and furnished it with great splendour. On the day of its dedication to the Buddha and the monks, as the water of donation fell on the Buddha's hand, there arose in Távatimsa a celestial mansion, measuring twelve leagues in each direction, for Nandiya's use. During one of Moggallána's visits to Távatimsa he saw this mansion, and was told by many nymphs that they were awaiting Nandiya's arrival (DhA.iii.290ff). The Vimána Vatthu Commentary (VvA.222f ) goes on to say that after a life devoted to good deeds Nandiya died, and was born in his celestial mansion, and that Revatí, on the death of her husband, stopped the gifts of alms, abused the monks, and was cast alive into the Ussada niraya by the orders of Vessavana.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;4.

Nandiya Sutta&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nandiya, the Sákiyan, is taught by the Buddha hat the Ariyan disciple who is possessed of unwavering loyalty to the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha, and who has the Ariyan qualities, is bound for enlightenment. S.v.403.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;4.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Nágadípa&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A province of Ceylon, identified with the modern Jaffna peninsula and the north west of Ceylon. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha's second visit to Ceylon was to Nágadípa, to settle a dispute between two Nágas, Mahodara and Cúlodara (Mhv.i.47). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jambukola (q.v.) was a harbour in Nágadípa, and there a vihára was built by Devánampiyatissa (Ibid., xx.25) and later restored by Kanitthatissa (Ibid., xxxvi.9). This vihára was probably called Tissa vihára (See ibid.,36). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another vihára, called Sálipabbata, was built by Mahallaka Nága (Ibid.,xxxv.124). The Unnalomaghara, the Rájáyatana dhátucetiya and the Amalacetiya were probably all places of worship in Nágadípa (Cv.xlii.62). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Valáhassa Játaka (J.ii.128) says that the coast of Ceylon, from the river Kalyání to Nágadípa, was once infested by yakkhinis. Once (J.iii.187) Nágadípa was known as Serumadípa, and near by was Karadípa, earlier known as Ahidípa (J.iv.238). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An old story, given in the Commentaries (E.g., VibhA.444), speaks of a king called Díparágá, who reigned over Nágadípa in great splendour. Nágadípa was once an important centre of Buddhism in Ceylon (E.g., ibid., 446, 467; AA.i.422. MA.i.545; see also J.R.A.S., vol. xxvi) and contained many places of pilgrimage. There is a legend (DA.iii.899; VibhA.433) which relates that, when the Buddha's sásana comes to an end, all the Buddha's relics in Ceylon will gather together at the Mahácetiya and travel to the Rájáyatanacetiya in Nágadípa, and then from there to the Mahábodhi tree at Gayá.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman"&gt;According to the Rasaváhiní (ii.19) the place was so called because it was given as gift to the woman named Nagá.

Nisabha Thera&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was born in a Koliyan family, and, having seen the Buddha's wisdom and power in the fight between the Sákyans and the Koliyans, he entered the Order and became an arahant. Two verses uttered by him in admonition of a fellow worker are found in the Therágathá (vs.195f.). In time of Vipassí Buddha he was a householder, and gave to the Buddha a kapittha fruit (Thag.i.318). He is probably identical with Kapitthaphaladáyaka of the Apadána.

There is a record in the Samyutta Nikáya (S.iv.322), </data>
<data>of the town having been the victim of a severe famine during the Buddha's time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nálandá was the residence of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/sonadinnaa')"&gt;Sonnadinná&lt;/a&gt; (VvA.144). &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/n/nigantha_nataputta')"&gt;Nigantha Nátaputta&lt;/a&gt; is several times mentioned as staying at Nálandá, which was evidently a centre of activity of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/n/niganthaa')"&gt;Niganthas&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/h/hiuen_tsang')"&gt;Hsouien Thsang&lt;/a&gt; (Beal: op. cit., ii.167f ) gives several explanations of the name Nálandá. One is that it was named after the Nága who lived in a tank in the middle of the mango grove. Another -  and accepted by him -  is that the Bodhisatta once had his capital here and gave &quot;alms without intermission,&quot; hence the name.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nálanda is, in the northern books, given as the name of Sáriputta's birthplace (see Nálaka). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nálanda is identified with the modern Baragaon (CAGI. 537).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;2. Nálandá&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;A village in the central province of Ceylon. Once Parakkamabáhu I. occupied a camp there, and it is several times mentioned in the accounts of his campaigns. Cv.lxx.167, 207; lxxii.169.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;1. Nálandá Sutta&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;A conversation between the Buddha and Upáligahapati in Pávárika’s mango grove, as to why some beings attain full freedom in this world while others do not. S.iv.110.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;2.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Nálaka&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nephew of Asita (Káladevala). When Asita realized that he would not live to see the Buddha, he sought out Nálaka and asked him to leave the world at once and become an ascetic and hold himself in readiness to profit by the Buddha's Enlightenment.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This Nálaka did, though possessing eighty thousand crores of wealth, and he spent his time in Himavá. When the time came, he visited the Buddha seven days after the Buddha's first sermon and questioned him on the Moneyyapatipadá (also called the Nálakapatipadá, because it is included in the Nálaka Sutta). Nálaka retired once more into Himavá and there attained arahantship. There he spent seven months leaning against a golden rock, practising patipadá in its highest form. After his death the Buddha, with his monks, visited the scene of his death, cremated his remains, and had a cetiya built over them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is said that Nálaka’s aspiration to learn and practise the Moneyyapatipadá was made in the time of Padumuttara Buddha. J.i.55; SNA.ii.483ff., 501. The story as drawn from Tibetan sources differs greatly from this story. (See, e.g. Rockhill: op. cit., p. 18, 45 f). In the Mahávastu (iii.380, 387) he is called Kátyáyana.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

J.i.38; Bu.xiii.26.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;2. Nágá&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the chief women supporters of Phussa Buddha. Bu.xix.21.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;3. Nágá&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;A former birth of Asokamálá, when she was the wife of Tissa (later Sáliya), an artisan of Mundagangá. MT.605.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;4. Nágá Therí&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;An arahant of Bhátaragáma. During the pillage of Bráhmana Tissa, when all the villagers had fled, she went with her colleagues to a banyan tree, the presiding deity of which provided them with food. She had a brother, Nága; when he visited her she gave him part of her food, but he refused to accept food from a bhikkhuni. MA.i.546; AA.ii.654.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;5. Nágá&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;A class of beings. See Appendix.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;6. Nága&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;An eminent Therí of Ceylon. Dpv.xviii.35.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;7. Nágá&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;A woman who lived near the Rájáyatana-cetiya. Once, seeing sixty monks return from the village with empty bowls, she, although already pledged to work by day, borrowed some money on promise to work at night as well, and gave them food. The monks retired to Mucalindavana and developed arahantship before eating. The deity of the king's parasol shouted applause, and the king, having heard the story, gave Nágá the whole island, which thus came to be called Nágádipa. Ras.ii.16f. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;8. Nágá&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;A class of beings classed with Garulas and Supannas and playing a prominent part in Buddhist folk lore. They are gifted with miraculous powers and great strength. Generally speaking, they are confused with snakes, chiefly the hooded Cobra, and their bodies are described as being </data>
<data>those of snakes, though they can assume human form at will. They are broadly divided into two classes: those that live on land (thalaja) and those that live on water (jalaja). The Jalaja-nágá live in rivers as well as in the sea, while the Thalaja-nágá are regarded as living beneath the surface of the earth. Several Nága dwellings are mentioned in the books: e.g., Mañjerika-bhavana under Sineru, Daddara-bhavana at the foot of Mount Daddara in the Himálaya, the Dhatarattha-nágá under the river Yamuná, the Nábhásá Nágá in Lake Nabhasa, and also the Nágas of Vesáli, Tacchaka, and Payága (D.ii.258). The Vinaya (ii.109) contains a list of four royal families of Nágas (Ahirájakuláni): Virúpakkhá, Erápathá, Chabyáputtá and Kanhagotamaká. Two other Nága tribes are generally mentioned together: the Kambalas and the Assataras. It is said (SA.iii.120) that all Nágas have their young in the Himálaya.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stories are given - e.g., in the Bhúridatta Játaka - of Nágas, both male and female, mating with humans; but the offspring of such unions are watery and delicate (J.vi.160). The Nágas are easily angered and passionate, their breath is poisonous, and their glance can be deadly (J.vi.160, 164). They are carnivorous (J.iii.361), their diet consisting chiefly of frogs (J.vi.169), and they sleep, when in the world of men, on ant hills (ibid., 170). The enmity between the Nágas and the Garulas is proverbial (D.ii.258). At first the Garulas did not know how to seize the Nágas, because the latter swallowed large stones so as to be of great weight, but they learnt how in the Pandara Játaka (q.v.). The Nágas dance when music is played, but it is said (J.vi.191) that they never dance if any Garula is near (through fear) or in the presence of human dancers (through shame).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best known of all Nágas is Mahákála, king of Mañjerika-bhavana (q.v.). He lives for a whole kappa, and is a very </data>
<data>pious follower of the Buddha. The Nágas of his world had the custodianship of a part of the Buddha's relics till they were needed for the Máha Thúpa (Mhv.xxxi.27f.), and when the Bodhi tree was being brought to Ceylon they did it great honour during the voyage (Mbv. p.. 163f.). Other Nága kings are also mentioned as ruling with great power and majesty and being converted to the Buddha's faith - e.g., Aravála, Apalálá, Erapatta, Nandopananda, and Pannaka. (See also Ahicchatta and Ahinága.) In the Atánátiya Sutta (D.iii.198f.), speaking of dwellers of the Cátummahárajika world, the Nágas are mentioned as occupying the Western Quarter, with Virúpokkha as their king.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Nágas had two chief settlements in Ceylon, in Nágadípa (q.v.) and at the mouth of the river Kalyání. It was to settle a dispute between two Nága chiefs of Nágadípa, Mahodara and Cúlodara, that the Buddha paid his second visit to Ceylon. During that visit he made a promise to another Nága-king, Manjakkhika of Kalyání, to pay him a visit, and the Buddha's third visit was in fulfilment of that undertaking (Mhv.i.48f.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Nágas form one of the guards set up by Sakka in Sineru against the Asuras (J.i.204). The Nágas were sometimes worshipped by human beings and were offered sacrifices of milk, rice, fish, meat and strong drink (J.i.497f.). The jewel of the Nágas is famous for its beauty and its power of conferring wishes to its possessor (J.vi.179, 180).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The word Nága is often used as an epithet of the Buddha and the Arahants, and in this connection the etymology given is águm na karotí ti Nágo (e.g., MNid.201). The Bodhisatta was born several times as king of the Nágas: Atula, Campeyya, Bhúridatta, Mahádaddara, and Sankhapála.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the accounts given of the Nágas, there is undoubtedly great confusion between the Nágas as supernatural beings, </data>
<data>as snakes, and as the name of certain non Aryan tribes, but the confusion is too difficult to unravel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

He was the nephew of Mitta, one of Elára's generals. His genitals were hidden in his body, and he had the strength of ten elephants. When he was a baby, he was wont to wander about, and so was tied to a mill atone by a strap (nandhi), but he dragged the stone after him. In Anurádhapura he slew the Damilas who desecrated the temples, but later he joined the Singhalese soldiers in Rohana and fought in Dutthagámaní's campaigns.

<data>&lt;h3&gt;1. Nága Sutta&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once, when the Buddha was seated under the Ajapála Banyan tree, soon after his Enlightenment, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/maara')"&gt;Mára&lt;/a&gt; assumed the form of a fearsome elephant and tried to frighten him. But the Buddha recognised Mara and sent him away discomfited. S.i.103f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2. Nága Sutta&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A certain novice was in the habit of upending too much time in clansmen's houses. When warned against this, he answered that he could not understand how he was to blame when he saw many senior monks acting in the same way.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was reported to the Buddha, who related the story of an elephant who dwelt by a great lake. He plunged into the lake, pulled up lotus stalks, cleaned them and then, by eating them, gained strength and beauty. But when the baby elephants tried to follow his example, they could not clean the stalks, and eating them with mud and dirt, they grew sick, some of them even dying (S.ii.268).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;3. Nága Sutta&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Snakes which dwell in the Himálaya, when grown and strong, find their way into the sea, where they grow even greater. Even so do monks, who develop the Noble Eightfold Path (S.v.47).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;4. Nága Sutta&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;An elephant, to be fit for the royal stalls, should have four qualities: he should be a good listener (sotá), a good slayer (hantá), full of patience (khantá), and a good goer (gantá). A monk should have the corresponding qualities in order to be fit for the respect and gifts of the world. A.ii.116.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;5. Nága Sutta&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha goes to the bathing place near the Migáramátupásáda with Ananda, bathes there, and, while drying his limbs, sees Pasenadi's elephant, Seta, coming out of the bathing place, attended by great </data>
<data>ceremony. People, seeing him, express their wonder and admiration of the noble animal.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Udáyí (Káludáyí, says the Commentary, AA.ii.669), who is near by, asks the Buddha if it is only the elephant whom people praise for his bulk or do they praise other bulky things as well? They do, says the Buddha., praise all huge things -  horses, bulls, snakes, brew, and big men, calling them Nágas, but really, the best Nága is he who commits no enormity in word or thought (águn na karoti, tamnágo). Thereupon Udáyi breaks forth into song, praising the Buddha's teaching, comparing the Buddha to an elephant, each limb representing a different virtue (A.iii.345).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This sutta is also called Nágopama Sutta. ThagA.ii.7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;6. Nága Sutta&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes it happens that a forest dwelling elephant gets bored with the company of his fellows, his women folk and the young elephants who get in his way and interfere with his freedom. Thereupon he breaks away from them and retires into solitude. So should the monk, wearied of the haunts of men, resort to loneliness and there rid himself of the ásavas. A.iv.435.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Nága Vagga&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The twenty third chapter of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/dhammapada')"&gt;Dhammapada&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Nága Samyutta&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The nineteenth section of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/samyutta_nikaya')"&gt;Samyutta Nikáya&lt;/a&gt;.

One day when the Buddha was seated in the assembly of monks, the owl descended from its rock and worshipped him by lowering its wings, putting together its claws and bending its head.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha, seeing this, smiled, and said, in answer to Ananda's question, that one hundred thousand kappas hence the bird would become a Pacceka Buddha, Somanassa by name.

One day, seeing his sub-treasurer eating rice porridge, he wished for some himself, but, owing to his miserliness, he went in disguise to the river with a little rice and there started to cook it with the help of a slave. Sakka saw this, and, accompanied by Canda and the others, appeared before him disguised as a brahmin. Advancing towards him, Sakka asked him the way to Benares, and, pretending to be deaf, approached the place where the porridge was being cooked and asked for some. Maccharikosiya refused to give him any, but Sakka insisted on reciting to him some stanzas on the value of giving, and then Kosiya agreed to give him a little porridge. One by one the others, also disguised as brahmins, approached, and, in spite of all his efforts, Kosiya was forced to invite them to share his meal. He asked them to fetch small leaves, but in their hands small leaves became large. After the porridge had been served, Pañcasikha assumed the form of a dog, then of a horse of changing colours, and started chasing Kosiya, while the others stood motionless in the air. Kosiya asked how beings could gain such powers, and Sakka explained to him and revealed their identity. Maccharikosiya went back to Benares and gave away his wealth in charity. Later he became a hermit and lived in a hut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At that time the four daughters of Sakka - Asá, Saddhá, </data>
<data>Sirí and Hirí - went to Anotatta to play in the water. There they saw Nárada under a páricchattaka-flower, which served him as a sunshade, and each asked him for the flower. Nárada said he would give it to the best of them, and referred them to Sakka. Sakka sent (by Mátali) a cup of ambrosia (sudhábhojana) to Kosiya, and said that whichever of his daughters succeeded in persuading  Kosiya to share with her his drink would be adjudged the best. He listened to all their claims and decided in favour of Hirí. Sakka, wishing to know why he decided thus, sent Mátali in his chariot to ask him. While Mátali was yet speaking to him, Kosiya died and was reborn in Távatimsa. Sakka gave him Hirí as wife and also a share of the kingdom of Távatimsa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to a monk of Sávatthi, who was so generous that he would give away his own food and drink and so starve. He is identified with Maccharikosiya, Uppalavanná with Hirí, Anuruddha with Pañcasikha, Ananda with Mátali, Kassapa with Suriya, Moggallána with Canda, Sáriputta with Nárada, and Sakka with the Buddha himself.

From there he went with a caravan to Sávatthi, and, after hearing the Buddha preach, entered the Order. Later, obtaining the Buddha's permission, he returned to Sunáparanta (ThagA.i.158). There he attained arahantship, and five hundred men and five hundred women became lay followers of the religion. Under his direction they built a Gandhakuti, called Candanasálá, and Punna, wishing the Buddha to be present at the dedication festival, sent a flower through the air to the Buddha at Sávatthi as invitation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha accepted this invitation and went to Sunáparanta with four hundred and ninety nine arahants, including Kundadhána and Ananda, all in pinnacled palanquins, provided by Vissakamma, acting under orders from Sakka. On the way the Buddha stopped at Saccabaddhapabbata, where he converted the tápasa of the mountain, who became an arahant and travelled on with the party in the five hundredth palanquin. The Buddha spent the day in Sunáparanta, and, on his way back, stopped on the banks of the river Nammadá. There the Nágarájá paid him homage, and the Buddha left his footprint in the Nága's abode for him to worship. MA.ii.101f.; SA.iii.176; according to the latter account the Buddha spent seven days in Sunáparanta, at the Mankuláráma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The people of Sunáparanta were reported as being fierce and violent (M.iii.268; S.iv.61f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sunáparanta was also the birthplace of Culla-Punna and Isidinna (Isidatta) (q.v.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sunáparanta is probably identical with Aparanta; the Burmese, however, identify it with the country on the right bank of the Irrawaddy River, near Pagan.

The king was set free on condition that he sent one man daily to the Yakkha for food. As time went on, no one could be found to take rice to the Yakkha, because all knew what awaited them. Then the king offered one thousand, and the Bodhisatta, for the sake of his parents and against his mother's wishes, consented to go. Before going he obtained from the king his slippers, his umbrella, his sword, and his golden bowl filled with rice. Sutana then approached the Yakkha's tree, and, with the point of his sword, pushed the bowl of rice to him. The Yakkha then started talking to Sutana and was very pleased with him.

When Magha was born as &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sakka')"&gt;Sakka&lt;/a&gt; and looked for Sujá, he found that she had been born as a crane in a mountain cave.

The interview is described in the Subha Sutta (q.v.). At the end of the discourse he declared himself the Buddha's follower. While on his way back from the city, he met Jánussoni, and, on being asked what he thought of the Buddha, spoke of him in terms of the highest praise, saying that none but Gotama's own peer could utter sufficient praise of him (M.i.196f., 208f.; Jánussoni addresses him as Bháradvája). Subha is described (MA.ii.802; cf. M.i.202) as the son of the brahmin Todeyya (q.v.) of Tudigáma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere however, a different account is given of his conversion. (DA.ii.384f.; cf. MA.ii.963f., which adds that the Buddha proved the identity of the dog by getting it to indicate the place where Todeyya's treasure lay buried). Subba's father was a very rich merchant, chaplain to Pasenadi, but a great miser. After death he was born as a dog in the same home. One day, when the Buddha was going his alms round in Tudigáma near Sávatthi, he arrived at Subha's house. The dog saw the Buddha and barked, and the Buddha addressed it as &quot;Todeyya.&quot; The dog thereupon ran into the house and lay on a bed, from which no one could drive it away. When Subha asked the cause of the uproar, he was told the story. Thereupon he was very angry, saying that his father had been born in the Brahmaloka, and, in order to refute the Buddha, he visited the monastery. This was the occasion for the preaching of the Subha Sutta. Soon after the Buddha’s death, when Ananda, was staying in Sávatthi, Subha sent a young man to </data>
<data>Ananda, with his respects and an invitation to his house. Ananda, having taken medicine, did not go that day. But he went the next day, accompanied by a monk of Cetiya (Cetaka). Their conversation is recorded in the Subha Sutta (2) (D.i.204f). See also Cúlakammavibhahga Sutta, which too was preached to Subha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Subha.&lt;/b&gt; A palace guard, son of Datta. He closely resembled King Yasalálaka-Tissa in appearance, and the king used to place him on the throne, decked in royal ornaments, and watch the ministers doing obeisance to him, while he himself took the guard’s place. One day, while Subha was on the throne, he reprimanded the king, disguised as a guard, for smiling disrespectfully, and had him led away and executed before the truth was discovered. Subha then became king and ruled for six years (120-6 A.C.). He built the Subharája-parivena, the Vallí-vihára, the Ekadvára vihára and the Nandígámaka-vihára. He was deposed by Vasabha (Mhv.xxxv.51ff.; Dpv.xxi.45). His daughter married Vankanásika-Tissa. She had been adopted by a bricklayer, but Vasabha discovered her identity and married her to his son. Her good fortune was owing to a meal she had given to an arahant thera. For details see Mhv.xxxv.101ff.; see also Cv.xxxviii.13f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4.

Once, when he was seized by Ráhu, lord of the Asuras, he invoked the power of the Buddha, and the Buddha enjoined on Ráhu to let him go. This Ráhu did, and Suriya is spoken of as seeking Vepacitti and standing by his side, trembling and with stiffened hair (S.i.51; cf. Candimá). Suriya is one of the inhabitants of the Cátummahárájika-world (MNidA.108). Suriya and Candimá are both under the rule of Sakka, and we find Sakka asking them to stop their journeying at his behest. (E.g., when he wished the Sámaneras Pandita and Sukha to be able to meditate undisturbed (DhA.ii.143; iii.97). See also DhA.iii.208). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suriya was present at the preaching of the Mahásamaya Sutta (D.ii.260). He is sometimes (PSA. 253) described as Adicca (Aditi's son). The disk of the sun, which forms Suriya's vimána, is fifty leagues in diameter (E.g., D.iii.196).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2.

He saw the Buddha seated under a tree, his head covered; (to rouse the brahmin's curiosity and to prevent him from being repelled by the sight of a shaven head, says the Commentary) he approached him with the oblation and a water pitcher and addressed him. The Buddha uncovered his head. The sight of the shaven head at first made Sundarika draw back, but, realizing that some brahmins too were shaved, he questioned the Buddha about his birth. The Buddha explained to him that the important thing was not birth, but the leading of a good life. The brahmin was pleased and offered him the oblation, but the Buddha refused it, saying that he did not accept presents for chanting verses. He advised Sundarika to throw the food into the water, where there were no creatures, for who could digest food which had once been offered to a Buddha? The brahmin followed this advice and saw the water hiss and seethe with steam and smoke. Alarmed and with hair on end, he worshipped the Buddha, who preached to him. Sundarika entered the Order and became an arahant. S.i.167f. The account of the meeting between the Buddha and Sundarika is given in the Sutta Nipáta too (p.79 f.), but there the details differ greatly, though the topic of discussion is the same. Several additional verses are attributed to the Buddha regarding the true &quot;sacrifice.&quot; The Commentary calls the SN. discourse the Púralása Sutta (SNA.ii.400).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sundarika-Bháradvája was so called from his habit of offering oblations on the banks of the Sundariká (SA.i.181f). He is also </data>
<data>mentioned (M.i.39f) as meeting the Buddha on the banks of the Báhuká and asking him whether he bathed in that river, because it had the reputation of cleansing sins.

The king and his court ate the first portion of the fruit as big as pipkins and sweet; the army had the second portion, the town and country people the third, recluses and holy men the fourth, and birds and beasts the last. None guarded its fruit, and none would hurt another in order to obtain its fruit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One day there came a man who ate his fill of the fruit, broke a branch, and went his way. The deva of the tree was angry, and the tree bore no more fruit. Koravya visited Sakka and consulted him. Sakka sent a squall to punish the deva and made the deva appear before him full of repentance. Then Sakka warned him to keep the Rukkhadhamma, which was that various people take and make use of various parts of a tree; it is not for the deva of the tree to mope and pine on that account.

A stick gatherer, sleeping at night in a temple, heard two cocks, roosting on a tree near by, abusing each other. In the course of the quarrel one cock boasted that whoever ate his flesh would be king; his exterior, commander in chief or chief queen; his bones, royal treasurer or king's chaplain. The man killed the cock and his wife cooked it; then, taking it with them, they went to the river to bathe. They left the meat and the rice on the bank, but, as they bathed, a breeze blew the pot holding the food into the river. It floated down stream, where it was picked up by the elephant trainer. The Bodhisatta saw all this with his divine eye and visited the trainer at meal time. There he was offered the meat and divided it, giving the flesh to the trainer, the exterior to his wife, and keeping the bones for himself. Three days later the city was besieged by enemies. The king asked the trainer to don royal robes and mount the elephant, while he himself fought in the ranks. There he was killed by an arrow, and the trainer, having won the battle, was made king, his wife being queen, and the ascetic his chaplain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to a brahmin who tried to steal Anáthapindika's good fortune (siri). He perceived that this lay in a white cock, for which he begged. Anáthapindika gave it to him, but the good fortune left the cock and settled in a jewel. He asked for that also and was given it. But the good fortune went into a club. The club was also asked for, and Anáthapindika giving it, asked the brahmin to take it and be gone. But the good fortune now settled on Anáthapindika's wife. The brahmin then owned defeat, and confessed his intentions to Anáthapindika, who told the story to the Buddha. </data>

Susíma.&lt;/b&gt; The Bodhisatta in the time of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/atthadassii')"&gt;Atthadassí&lt;/a&gt; Buddha. He was a Mahásála brahmin of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/campaka')"&gt;Campaka&lt;/a&gt; and became an ascetic of great power. He heard the Buddha preach at &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/sudassana')"&gt;Sudassana&lt;/a&gt; and was converted. J.i.39; Bu.xv.9f.; BuA.180.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Susíma.&lt;/b&gt; The Bodhisatta, son of the chaplain of the king of Benares. He later became king himself. See the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/susiima_jat163_411')"&gt;Susíma Játaka&lt;/a&gt; (No. 411).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Susíma.&lt;/b&gt; A king of Benares. See the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/susiima_jat163_411')"&gt;Susíma Játaka&lt;/a&gt; (No, 163). He is identified with &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/aa/aananda')"&gt;Ananda&lt;/a&gt;. J.ii.50.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Susíma.&lt;/b&gt; A Devaputta. Once, when Ananda utters high praise of Sáriputta, Susíma, who is present, reflects on it and confirms all that Ananda has said. The retinue of Susíma listen enraptured, waxing wondrous, in divers colour-tones (&quot;even as a beautiful lustrous beryl-stone of eight facets, well polished, when laid in an orange coloured cloth, shines, glows and blazes, etc.&quot;) (S.163f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is said (SA.i.98) that Susíma had been a fellow celibate of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/saariputta')"&gt;Sáriputta&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;5. Susíma.&lt;/b&gt; One of the thousand sons of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sakka')"&gt;Sakka&lt;/a&gt;. He was one of the deva generals in the fight with the Asuras, but he was lazy, and Sakka had to admonish him (S.i.217; SA.i.262). He is probably identical with Susíma (4).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;6. Susíma. &lt;/b&gt;A &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/paribbajaka')"&gt;Paribbájaka&lt;/a&gt; (skilled in the Vedangas, </data>
<data>says Buddhaghosa, SA.ii.93) of Rájagaha. When the Buddha's fame spread and his gains increased, Susíma's followers suggested that he should learn the Buddha's doctrine and preach it to the laity so that he and his followers, too, could reap some of the advantages.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Susíma agreed, and sought, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/aa/aananda')"&gt;Ananda&lt;/a&gt;, who, with the Buddha’s sanction, ordained him. In discussion with the monks who declared that they had obtained complete emancipation, etc., Susíma discovered that all of them did not possess supernatural powers, but thought they had gained nibbána &quot;through insight.&quot; He thereupon sought the Buddha to have the matter explained. The Buddha asked him many questions, and made him realize the truth of their statement. Susíma confessed his original purpose in joining the Order and asked for forgiveness (S.ii.119ff). He developed insight and became an arahant. SA.ii.96.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;7. Susíma. &lt;/b&gt;A brahmin of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/t/takkasilaa')"&gt;Takkasilá&lt;/a&gt; and son of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sankha')"&gt;Sankha&lt;/a&gt;. He went to Benares and apprenticed himself to a teacher, who was his father's friend and who taught him various things. But he was able to understand only the beginning and the middle, and not the end. He therefore consulted his teacher, who confessed that neither did he understand the end, and advised him to seek the Pacceka Buddhas who were living in &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/i_/isipatana')"&gt;Isipatana&lt;/a&gt;. Susíma went there, entered the Order, and became a Pacceka Buddha. Soon afterwards he died, and Sankha, coming in search of his son, was told of what had happened. Sankha is identified with the Bodhisatta.

The stag was the leader of eight myriads of deer. One day a hunter set a snare and the Bodhisatta's foot got entangled therein. He gave a succession of warning cries and the herd fled. The doe, however, came up to him and encouraged him to try to break the noose. But all his efforts were in vain, and, when the hunter approached, the doe went up to him and asked to be allowed to die in her mate's place. The hunter was so touched and amazed that he set them both free, and the stag gave him a magic jewel which he had found on the feeding ground.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to a girl of Sávatthi who belonged to a family devoted to the two Chief Disciples. She married an unbeliever, but was allowed to practise her own religion unmolested. She finally persuaded her husband to listen to a sermon by Sáriputta, and both husband and wife became sotápannas. Later, they joined the Order and became arahants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Channa (the husband) is identified with the hunter, while the woman was the doe. J.iii.182-7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Sujáta.&lt;/b&gt; The name of Upáli Thera (q.v.) in the time of Padumuttara Buddha. ThagA.i.229.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;9. Sujáta Thera.&lt;/b&gt; He was a brahmin of Benares, father of Sundarí Therí. While grieving for the death of his son, he met Vásitthí Therí, and from her he heard about the Buddha, whom he visited at Mithilá.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He entered the Order under the Buddha, attaining arahantship on the third day (ThigA.229).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is perhaps this Thera who is mentioned in the Samyutta Nikáya (S.ii.278f ) as having won the special praise of the Buddha because of his bright expression.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
<data>&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;10. Sujáta.&lt;/b&gt; A householder of Benares. He once went to hear the leader of a company of ascetics preach in the royal park and spent the night there. During the night, he saw Sakka arrive with his apsarases to pay homage to the ascetics, and he fell in love with one of them. His passion for her was so great that he died of starvation. The story is given in the Mahásutasoma Játaka. J.v.468f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;11. Sujáta.&lt;/b&gt; The Bodhisatta born as a landowner of Benares. See the Sujáta Játaka (3).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;12. Sujáta. &lt;/b&gt;Son of the Assaka king in Polanagara. He was expelled from the country at the request of his stepmother and lived in the forest. At that time Mahá Kaccána, following on the holding of the First Council, was living in the Assaka country. One of Sujáta's friends, a devaputta in Távatimsa, appeared before Sujáta in the shape of a deer, and, after leading him to Mahá Kassapa, disappeared. Sujáta saw the Thera and talked with him. Mahá Kassapa saw that Sujáta had but five months to live, and, after stirring up his mind, sent him back to his father, urging him to good deeds. When the king heard his story he sent a messenger for Mahá Kaccána. Sujáta lived another four months and, after death, was reborn in Távatimsa. Later he visited Mahá Kaccána to show his gratitude and revealed his identity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story is known as the Cúlarathavimána. Vv.v.13; VvA.259-270.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;13. Sujáta.&lt;/b&gt; Called Sujáta Pippaláyana of Mahátittha. He married the daughter of the brahmin Kapila, a previous birth of Bhaddá Kápilání. ThigA.73.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Sulasá Játaka (No. 419)&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once in Benares there lived a courtezan, Sulasá, whose price was one thousand a night. In Benares also lived a robber, Sattaka. One day he was taken by the king's men, and, as he was being led to execution, Sulasá saw him and fell in love with him. She bribed the chief guard to free him and lived with him. After a few months Sattaka, tired of her, and, wishing to kill her, took her to a lonely mountain top, saying that he had made a vow to the deity dwelling there. When Sulasá discovered his real intention, she begged leave to be allowed to pay obeisance to him before her death, and, as she walked round him, she watched her opportunity and pushed him down the precipice, where he was crushed to death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related in reference to Puññalakkhaná, a slave girl of Anáthapindika's wife. The girl borrowed a costly jewel belonging to her mistress and went to the pleasure garden. There a thief became friendly with her and planned to kill her. But she, reading his thoughts, asked him to draw some water for her from a well near by, and as he did so, she pushed him into the well and threw a stone down on to his head. The characters in the two stories were identical.

Subha Sutta. &lt;/b&gt;Subha Todeyyaputta (q.v.) visits the Buddha at Sávatthi and asks him various questions regarding the Dhamma, comparing it with the teachings of the brahmins regarding ultimate salvation. He admits that no one among the brahmins or the early sages had fully discerned and realized the qualities laid down by them for the attainment of merit and the achievement of right. He quotes Pokkharasáti as saying that those who, like Gotama, profess to transcend ordinary human beings and rise to the heights of Ariyan knowledge are idle boasters. The Buddha retorts that Pokkharasáti cannot even read the thoughts of his slave girl, Punniká. The Buddha then convinces Subha that he has discovered the way to union with Brahmá, and, at his request, teaches him this way, as being the four Brahma-viháras. Subha acknowledges himself the Buddha’s follower. M.ii.196-209.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Subha Sutta.&lt;/b&gt; A conversation between Subha Todeyyaputta (q.v.) and Ananda at Sávatthi soon after the Buddha's death. Subha asks Ananda what were the bodies of doctrine which the Buddha was wont to praise, to which he incited others and in which he established them. Ananda explains to him. The sutta is almost word for word identical with the Sámaññáphala Sutta. D.i.204-10.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Subha Sutta. &lt;/b&gt;According to Buddhaghosa, (MA.ii.962, 967) Subha Sutta is the real name for the Cúla-kammavibhanga Sutta (q.v.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

The Buddha saw him once and asked him the reason for this. Sigála's reply was that his dead father had asked him to do so. The Buddha then taught him that, in his religion, too, there war, worship of the six quarters, but that these quarters were different. Urged by Sigála, to explain, the Buddha taught him the six vices in conduct, the four motives for such evil action, the six channels for dissipating wealth, and the different kinds of friends. He then taught him the six quarters to be honoured by performing the duties owing to them parents are the east, teachers the south, wife and children the west, friends and companions the north, servants and workpeople the nadir, religious teachers and brahmins the zenith. Details are then given of the duties owing to these and of their counter duties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sutta is an exposition of the whole domestic and social duty of a layman, according to the Buddhist point of view, and, as such, it is famous under the name of Gihivinaya (D.iii.180-93).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sigálaka became the Buddha's follower. According to the Apadána (Ap.ii.604), it was this Sigálaka's mother who was known as Sigálakamátá (q.v.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

In the time of the Buddha he had been the brahmin Nanduttara, and had entertained the Buddha on the occasion on which, at Payágatittha, Bhaddaji Thera had raised, from the bed of the Ganges, the palace he had occupied as Mahápanáda. Filled with marvel, Nanduttara wished that he might have the power of procuring relics possessed by others. Sonuttara visited the Mañjerika-nága-bhavana and asked the Nága king, Mahákála, to give him the relics which he had there and which had once been enshrined in Rámagáma. But Mahákála, unwilling to part with them, told his nephew, Vásuladatta, to hide them. Sonuttara knew this, and when Mahákála told him he might take the relics if he could find them, Sonuttara, by his magic power, took the relic casket from Vásuladatta, unknown to him, and brought it to Anurádhapura, where the relics were deposited in the Mahá Thúpa.

<data>&lt;h2&gt;Serivánija Játaka (No. 3)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bodhisatta was a hawker of Seriva, and was called Serivá. Once, in the company of a greedy merchant of the same name, he crossed the Telaváha and entered Andhapura. In that city was a family fallen on evil days, the sole survivors being a girl and her grandmother. The greedy merchant went to their house with his wares. The girl begged her grandmother to buy her a trinket, and suggested that they should give the hawker in exchange the bowl from which they ate. This was an heirloom and made of gold; but it had lost its lustre, and the women did not know its value. The hawker was called in and shown the bowl. He scratched it with a needle and knew it was of gold, but, wishing to have it for nothing, said it was not worth one half farthing. So saying he threw it away and left. Later the Bodhisatta came to the same street and was offered the same bowl. He told them the truth, gave them all the money he had and his stock, leaving only eight pieces of money for himself. These he gave to a boatman, and entered his boat to cross the river. Meanwhile the greedy merchant went again to the old woman's house, hoping to get the bowl in exchange for a few trinkets. When he heard of what had happened he lost command of himself, and, throwing down all he had, ran down to the river, to find the Bodhisatta's boat in mid stream. He shouted to the boatman to return, but the Bodhisatta urged him on. The merchant, realizing what he had lost through his greed, was so upset that his heart burst, and he fell down dead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told to a monk who had given up striving. The greedy merchant is identified with Devadatta, and this was the beginning of his enmity towards the Bodhisatta. J.i.110ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

When the Buddha was in Campá, on the banks of the Gaggará-lake, Sonadanda visited him in spite of the protests of his friends and colleagues. Their conversation is recorded in the Sonadanda Sutta. At the end of the discourse, Sonadanda expressed his appreciation of the Buddha and his doctrine, and invited him and his monks to a meal. At the conclusion of the meal Sonadanda asked the Buddha to forgive him if, in the presence of the brahmins, he did not make humble obeisance to the Buddha, but merely saluted him. Buddhaghosa explains (D.i.111ff., DA.i.292ff ) that this was because Sonadanda was much older than the Buddha and did not wish people to see him paying homage to one young enough to be his grandson. But, probably, Sonadanda's conversion to the faith was only partial. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Angaka (q.v.) was Sonadanda's sister's son.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

When he was born he looked like a lump of flesh, and his mother gave orders that he should be put in a vessel and cast on the rubbish heap. The Nága-king of the city kept guard over the vessel, but when the people crowded round him and said &quot;Su-sú,&quot; he left it and went away. In the crowd was a minister's son, and, when the vessel was opened and the child was discovered, he decided to adopt him. In due course the child grew up, and when the infuriated populace deposed the parricide Nágadásaka, they placed Susunága on the throne. He was called Susunága because he was guarded by the Nága who disappeared when the people said &quot;Su-sú.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

When being led before the king, he saw snake charmers exhibiting their snake and warned them lest it should bite them. &quot;He is not like you,&quot; they replied, &quot;for he is good.&quot; The king ordered the chaplain to be executed; but, on hearing of his intentions, he allowed him to become an ascetic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related in reference to a learned and pious brahmin, in the service of the king of Kosala, who carried out a similar test. Then he joined the Order and became an arahant. J.i.369-71.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2.

The teacher, wishing to test them, told them that he wished to give his daughter in marriage, and asked them to steal things for her ornaments and clothes without letting anyone know. They all did this except the Bodhisatta, who brought nothing. When asked the reason of this behaviour, he said: &quot;You accept nothing unless brought in secrecy; but in wrong doing there is no secrecy.&quot; The teacher then explained his intention, and, very pleased with the Bodhisatta, gave him his daughter in marriage. The names of six pupils who stole were: Dujjacca, Ajacca, Nanda, Sukha Vacchana, Vajjha and Addhuvasíla.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related, late at night, to a company of monks who went about discussing the pleasures of the senses.

There he preached the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/diighanakha_s')"&gt;Díghanakha&lt;/a&gt; (or Vedanápariggaha) Sutta to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/diighanakha')"&gt;Díghanakha&lt;/a&gt;. Sáriputta was also present, and the sutta led to his attainment of arahantship (M.i.497, 501; DhA.i.79; UdA.189).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A conversation which the Buddha had there with Sáriputta is recorded in the Samyutta Nikáya (S.v.233f). The Commentary says (SA.iii.197) that, in the time of Kassapa Buddha, this cave was found as a hollow in the ground when the earth was yet growing, during the interval between the two Buddhas. One day a boar dug up the soil in the neighbourhood of the ground which concealed the cave. The sky god sent rain which washed away the soil, and the cave was disclosed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A forest dweller saw it and looked after it, thinking it to be the dwelling of holy men. He removed the earth round it, fenced it in, cleaned it out, and, making it as beautiful as a golden bowl, furnished it with couch and stool and presented it to the Buddha. The cave was deep and could only be reached by climbing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Sela.&lt;/b&gt; A brahmin of Anguttarápa. He was a great friend of Keniya, the Jatila, and visited him when Keniya was making preparations to entertain the Buddha. Having heard the word &quot;Buddha&quot; from Keniya, Sela was filled with joy and fortitude, and went with his two hundred and fifty pupils to visit the Buddha in the woodland near Apana. There he observed on the person of the Buddha the thirty two marks of a Great Being all except two - viz., hidden privates and the long tongue. The Buddha read his thoughts and contrived, by his iddhi power, that Sela should be satisfied on these two points as well (This is referred to at Mil.167; DA.i.276, etc.). Sela then praised the Buddha in a series of verses and asked questions of him. At the end of his talk, Sela entered the Order with his pupils, and, at the end of a week, he attained arahantship (SN. p.104 ff. = M.ii.146f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Padumuttara Buddha Sela had been the leader of the same guild of three hundred men, and, together with them, had built a parivena for the Buddha and done many good acts. As a result of these they received the &quot;ehi Bhikkhu-pabbajjá&quot; in this last life (SNA.ii.455; MA.ii.782; see also Ap.i.316; Thag.vs.818-41; Th4gA.ii.47f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mahásela, mentioned as the teacher of Sugandha Thera (ThagA.i.80f), is probably identical with this Sela. Sela lived to the age of one hundred and twenty (DA.ii.413).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Dhammapada Commentary (DhA.i.384; also AA.i.219), the Buddha first met Sela on his way to Bhaddiya to convert Visákhá </data>

It was under a sála tree in Subhagavana that the Múlapariyáya Sutta was preached (M.i.1; also the Játakas, of the same name, J.ii.259).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The wood was so called because of its beauty.

In his past life he had been Bhattabhatika (q.v.). In his last life he was born in the house of a supporter of Sáriputta. During her pregnancy, his mother gave alms to five hundred monks, with Sáriputta at their head. When he was seven years old, he entered the Order under Sáriputta, on which occasion his parents held a special almsgiving lasting for seven days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once, while going with Sáriputta for alms, he noticed several things, and like the novice Pandita (q.v.) asked the Elder numerous questions. Then he expressed a wish to return to the monastery. Sáriputta agreed, and Sukha turned back saying, &quot;Sir, when you bring my food, pray bring me food of one hundred flavours. If you cannot obtain it through your own merit, you can obtain it through mine.&quot; So saying, he returned to his cell and meditated on the nature of the body. Sakka's throne was heated, and he sent the Four Regent Gods to keep away all noise from Sukha's cell. He also bade the Sun and Moon stand still. Sukha, helped by this silence, became an anágámí.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Sáriputta had gone to a house where he knew he could get the food desired by Sukha, and, having eaten there, returned with Sukha's portion to the monastery. The Buddha, thinking that Sáriputta's arrival might impede Sukha's attainment of arahantship, appeared near the gate of Sukha's cell and stood guard. As he stood there, the Buddha asked Sáriputta four questions. When the last question was answered, Sukha became an arahant. Thereupon Sáriputta opened the door and gave Sukha his food. Sukha ate it and washed the bowl. The Four Regent God's left their post, Sakka let go the rope of the door of the novice's cell, and the Sun and Moon started once more on their </data>

At that time &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/maha_kaccaana')"&gt;Mahá Kaccána&lt;/a&gt; lived near by and often visited her home. Sona was very attached to him, and was later ordained by him. Three years later he received the upasampadá, and, with </data>
<data>Mahá Kaccána’s leave, visited the, Buddha. Kálí gave him a large carpet to spread in the Buddha's &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/g/gandhakuti')"&gt;Gandhakuti&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Sona arrived at the Gandhakuti, he worshipped the Buddha, who asked &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/aa/aananda')"&gt;Ananda&lt;/a&gt; to find him a lodging. Ananda, reading the Buddha's thoughts, spread a rug in the Buddha's chamber. Late at night Sona went to bed, and, very early the next morning, the Buddha woke him and asked him to recite the Dhamma. Sona recited the whole of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/atthaka_s_v')"&gt;Atthakavagga&lt;/a&gt;, which he had learnt from Mahá Kaccána. At the end of the recital the Buddha applauded him and gave him a boon. Sona asked for the &quot;Vinaya-dharapañcamaganena upasampadá, which Kaccána had asked him to choose. (This means permission to admit a monk into the Order with a chapter of only five monks, one of whom was versed in the Vinaya. For details of Sona's visit to the Buddha, see Vin.i.194ff.; cf. Ud.v.6). Later he returned to Kuraraghara and visited his mother's house. She had heard of the Buddha's applause from the devas, and wished Sona to recite the Dhamma just as he had done before the Buddha, and this he did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Padumuttara Buddha Sona had resolved to win this eminence. In the time of Vipassí Buddha he was a member of the Order and sewed a robe for a monk. Later he was a tailor of Benares and mended a Pacceka Buddha's robe (Thag.vss.365-9; AA.i.133f.; ThagA.i.429).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dhammapada Commentary says (DhA.iv.103f) that, on the day when Sona recited the Dhamma in Kuraraghara, Kálí went to listen to him, leaving only one female slave in the house. Her house had seven walls and fortified gates and savage dogs on leash. Molten lead flowed round the walls at night, and in the night it proved a slippery surface, difficult to walk on. Nine </data>
<data>hundred thieves had been awaiting a chance of breaking into the house, and this day they saw their opportunity. They stationed one of their number to watch Kálí going to the monastery, and to kill her if she started homewards after the thieves entered her house. When they came her female servant ran to the monastery to tell her about it. But she would not be disturbed and sent her back. Again the servant went, and again she was sent back. When the thief, stationed near Kálí, saw her extraordinary piety, he was filled with remorse, and, at the end of the sermon, begged her forgiveness. All the nine hundred thieves joined the Order under Sona Kutikanna, and on the day they became arahants the Buddha appeared before them in a ray of light to encourage them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Udána Commentary (UdA.307), Sona was called Kutikanna because he wore ear ornaments worth one crore (koti). It is said that he once went with a caravan to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/ujjenii')"&gt;Ujjeni&lt;/a&gt;, and when the caravan stopped for the night he slept away from the rest of its members. The caravan started very early and nobody waked Sona. When he finally awoke, he ran along the road till he came to a large tree. There he saw an ugly man tearing off his own flesh and eating it. On enquiry, Sona learnt that he had been a wicked merchant of Bhárukaccha, who had been born as a peta because he had deceived his patrons. This revelation filled Sona with great misgivings, which were increased by the sight of two peta boys with blood pouring out of their lips. They had been youths, also of Bhárukaccha, who had found fault with their mother for feeding an arahant monk. When Sona returned from Ujjeni he consulted Mahá Kaccána about these things, and resolved to enter the Order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Vinaya says (Vin.i.195f) that when Kaccána wished to confer the higher ordination on Sona, it was three years before he could get </data>
<data>together the necessary chapter of ten monks. This was because there were but few monks in &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/avanti')"&gt;Avanti&lt;/a&gt; and in the Southern Country; hence Sona's request to the Buddha that he should allow five monks to officiate in Avanti. Other boons asked for by Sona and allowed by the Buddha were:  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;(1) Permission to use, in Avanti, shoes with thick linings, because the soil of Avanti was black and always muddy;   &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;(2) permission to bath constantly; &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;(3) to use skins for coverlets; &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;(4) to accept robes set apart for absent monks even   after the lapse of ten days.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sona is evidently identical with Pátihírasaññaka of the Apadána (Ap.ii.392). Gosála Thera was a friend of Sona Kutikanna. ThagA.i.79.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a name="5"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;. Sona-Kolivisa Thera&lt;/b&gt;, also called &lt;b&gt;Sukhumála Sona&lt;/b&gt; (AA.ii.679).  He was born in &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/campaa')"&gt;Campá&lt;/a&gt;, his father being Usabhasetthi. From the time of his conception his father's wealth continued to increase, and, on the day of his birth, the whole town kept festival. Because in a previous birth he had given a ring, worth one hundred thousand, to a Pacceka Buddha, his body was like burnished gold - hence his name. (He was evidently called Kolivisa because he was a Koliyan, Ap.i.95, 21). His hands and feet were soft like bandhujívaka-flowers, and a fine down grew on them (four inches long on his feet, Ap.i.298) curved &quot;like ear ornaments.&quot; He lived in great luxury in three palaces, each having its own season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;King &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bimbisara')"&gt;Bimbisára&lt;/a&gt;, hearing of him, sent for him and Sona went with eighty thousand fellow townsmen. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
<data>&lt;p&gt;In Rájagaha he heard the Buddha preach, and, winning faith, entered the Order with his parents' consent. The Buddha gave him a subject for meditation, and he went to Sítavana, but many people visited him and he was unable to concentrate. He strove hard, and, through pacing up and down in meditation, painful sores developed on his feet. But he won no attainment and was filled with despair. The Buddha saw this and visited him, and by preaching to him the Vínúpamováda Sutta (see Sona Sutta), taught him how to temper energy with calm. Thus corrected, he put forth fresh effort and attained arahantship (Thag.vss.632).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Vinaya (i.179ff) gives details of Sona's visit to Bimbisára. The king, being curious to see Sona's feet, sent for him. He and his eighty-thousand companions went to see the Buddha, and there they were greatly impressed by the iddhi-power of Ságata. Sona then sought the Buddha alone and joined the Order. After ordination he walked about meditating, his feet bled, and his cankamana was covered with blood &quot;like a slaughter house for oxen.&quot; After Sona attained arahantship, the Buddha gave him permission to wear shoes with one lining. Sona said he had abandoned eighty cartloads of gold and a retinue of seven elephants. He did not wish, as a monk, to have any luxuries which his colleagues did not share, The Buddha then gave permission to all monks to wear shoes with one lining.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Anomadassí Buddha he was a very rich setthi, and, having gone with others to the vihára and heard the Buddha preach, he decorated a cankamana for the Buddha and a long hall (díghasálá) for the monks. On the cankamana he scattered various flowers, and, above it, he hung canopies. In the time of Padumuttara Buddha he was a setthi of Hamsavatí named Sirivaddha. It was then that he resolved to win eminence as foremost of those </data>
<data>who strove energetically (aggam áraddhaviriyánan), and in this he was successful (A.i.24). After the death of Kassapa Buddha Sona was a householder in Benares, and built a hut by the river for a Pacceka Buddha, whom he looked after during the rainy season. He was king of the gods for twenty five kappas, and seventy-seven times king among men under the name of Yasodhara. ThagA.i.544f.; cf. Ap.i.93f., where he is called Koliyavessa. The ApA. confused his story with that of Kutikanna; see also AA.i.130f., where the details are different, especially regarding the honour paid by Sona to the Pacceka Buddha. Once, on visiting the Pacceka Buddha's cell, he noticed that the ground outside it was muddy; so he spread on the ground a rug worth one hundred thousand, so that the Pacceka Buddha's feet might not be soiled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Apadána mentions (Ap.i.298) a Thera, called Sona Kotivísa, evidently identical with the above, the reason given for the name being that he gave away wealth equal in value to twenty crores (vísa koti). His eminence is ascribed to the fact that, in the time of Vipassí Buddha, he made a lena (cave) for the Buddha and his monks and spread it with rugs. Buddhaghosa (AA.i.130) gives a variant of his name, calling him Kotivessa, and explains this by saying that he belonged to a vessa (merchant) family worth a crore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Sona Sutta (Cf. AA.ii.680, where he is described as gandhabbasippe cheko) mentions that Sona was a clever player of the víná before he joined the Order. It was the example of Sona Kolivisa which urged Nandaka and his brother, Bharata, to leave the world. ThagA.i.299.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;6. Sona. &lt;/b&gt;An arahant monk who was sent with Uttara to convert Suvannabhúmi. Dpv.viii.12; Sp.i.68, 69; Mhv.xii.6, 44ff.; for details see Suvannabhúmi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;7. Sona. &lt;/b&gt;A minister of Mahásena and a follower of </data>
<data>the heretic monk, Sanghamitta. He helped Sanghamitta in the despoliation of the Lohapásáda and other buildings. He was killed in an attempt to destroy the Thúpáráma (Mhv.xxxvii.10, 13, 28). In the Dípavamsa (Dpv.xxii.70, 71) he is called Pápasona.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;8. Sona.&lt;/b&gt; See Mahásona.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;9. Sona-Potiríyaputta&lt;/b&gt; (or Setthiputta) Thera. He was born in Kapilavatthu as the son of the zemindar Potiríya (Selissariya), and became chief of the forces of the Sákyan Bhaddiya. When Bhaddiya left the world, Sona followed his example and entered the Order. But he was lazy and not given to meditation. The Buddha saw this from the Ambavana at Anupiyá and, sending forth a ray of glory, spurred him on. Sona became agitated, and putting forth effort became an arahant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Sikhí Buddha he was a forester and gave the Buddha a kuruñjiya-fruit (Thag.vss.193, 194; ThagA.i.316f). He is probably identical with Kuruñjiyaphaladáyaka of the Apadána. Ap.ii.448f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;10. Sona. &lt;/b&gt;A gahapatiputta of Rájagaha. He is mentioned as having had two conversations with the. Buddha at Veluvana: one on the impermanence of the body, feelings, etc., their origin and their cessation (S.iii.48f); and, on another occasion, as to why some beings achieve complete cessation in this life and others do not. S.iv.113.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;11. Sona.&lt;/b&gt; A gifted preacher, who lived in the Pipphali vihára at the foot of Sonnagiri. His father was a hunter, and all Sona's efforts to lead him away from sin failed, until he was very old, when Sona ordained him just before his death. The old man saw the Niraya and dogs coming to devour him. He shouted in his fright, and Sona took him on his bed to the vihára and made him worship the cetiya, the bodhi-tree, etc., and offered </data>
<data>various things in his father's name. He then saw the Devaloka before him. VibhA.439; cf. AA.i.255, where the vihára is called Pañcala-vihára, and MA.ii.887, where it is called Paceli-vihára.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;12. Sona. &lt;/b&gt;A Thera of the Mahávihára, at whose request the Kankhávitaraní was written. Knv., p.1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;13. Sona. &lt;/b&gt;See Sona and its compounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Sona Suttá. &lt;/b&gt;Two suttas, recording conversations between the Buddha and Sona-gahapati of Rájagaha. S.iii.48f.; iv.113.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Sona Sutta. &lt;/b&gt;Sona Kolivisa, living in Sítavana, despairs of ever attaining arahantship. The Buddha, on Gijjhakúta, becomes aware of this and visits him. The Buddha reminds him that when he was a víná player his víná sounded neither tuneful nor playable when the strings were either over-strung or over-lax. Even so, energy, when over-strung, ends in flurry, when over-lax, in idleness. Sona profits by the lesson and becomes an arahant. He then visits the Buddha and declares to him his new found vision. A.iii.374f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Sumana&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Sumana. &lt;/b&gt;The fourth of the twenty four Buddhas. He was born in Mekhala, his father being the khattiya Sudatta and his mother Sirimá. For nine thousand years he lived as a householder in three palaces - Canda, Sucanda and Vatamsa (BuA.125 calls them Nárivaddhana, Somavaddhana and Iddhivaddhana) - his wife being Vatamsiká and his son Anupama. He left the world on an elephant, practised austerities for ten months, and attained enlightenment under a nága tree, being given a meal of milk rice by Anupamá, daughter of Anupama-setthi of Anoma, and grass for his seat by the Ajívaka Anupama. His first sermon was preached in the Mekhala Park, and among his first disciples were his step brother Sarana and the purohita's son Bhávitatta. His Twin miracle was performed in Sunandavatí. The Bodhisatta was a Nága king Atula. One of the Buddha's chief assemblies was on the occasion of his solving the questions of King Arindama on Nirodha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sarana and Bhávitatta were his chief monks and Soná and Upasená his chief nuns. Udena was his personal attendant. Varuna and Sarana were his chief lay supporters among men and Cálá and Upacálá among women. His body was ninety cubits in height, and he died at the age of ninety thousand in Angáráma, where a thúpa of four yojanas was erected over his ashes. Bu.v.1ff.; BuA.125f.; J.i.30,34,35, 40.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Sumana. &lt;/b&gt;Attendant of Padumuttara Buddha (J.i.37; Bu.xi.24). His eminence prompted Ananda (Sumana in that birth) to resolve to be an attendant of some future Buddha. ThagA.ii.122; see also Ap.i.195.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Sumana. &lt;/b&gt;Step brother of Padumuttara, Buddha. He obtained, as boon from the king, the privilege of waiting on the Buddha for </data>
<data>three months. He built in the park of Sobhana a vihára. The park belonged to the householder Sobhana, and he built the vihára, on land for which he gave one hundred thousand. There he entertained the Buddha and his monks. Sunanda is identified with Ananda. ThagA.ii.122f.; AA.i.160f.; SA.ii.168f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Sumana.&lt;/b&gt; A pupil of Anuruddha. He represented the monks from Páveyyaka at the Second Council. Vásabhagámi was his colleague. See also Sumana (8). Mhv.iv.49, 58; Dpv.iv.48; v.24; Vin.ii.305, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a name="5"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;. Sumana. &lt;/b&gt;A garland maker, given as an example of one whose acts bore fruit in this very life (Mil.115, 291, 350; cf. DhSA.426; PSA.498). He was Bimbisára's gardener, and provided the king daily with eight measures of jasmine flowers, for which he received eight pieces of money, One day, while on his way to the palace, he saw the Buddha, and threw two handfuls of flowers into the air, where they formed a canopy over the Buddha's head. Two handfuls thrown on the right, two on the left and two behind, all remained likewise in the air and accompanied the Buddha as he walked through the city, a distance of three leagues, that all might see the miracle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Sumana returned home with his empty basket and told his wife what he had done, she was fearful lest the king should punish him. Going to the palace, she confessed what he had done, and asked for forgiveness for herself as she had had no part in the deed. Bimbisára visited the Buddha and then sent for Sumana. Sumana confessed that when he offered the flowers to the Buddha he was quite prepared to lose his life. The king gave him the eightfold gift: eight female slaves, eight sets of jewels, eight thousand pieces of money, eight women from the royal harem, and eight villages.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
<data>&lt;p&gt;In reply to a question by Ananda, the Buddha said that in the future the garland maker would become a Pacceka Buddha, Sumana. DhA.ii.40f.; KhA.129. According to KhA., the Pacceka Buddha's name will be Sumanissara.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;6. Sumana. &lt;/b&gt;Chief lay supporter of Kassapa Buddha. DA.ii.424; but see Sumangala (2).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;7. Sumana Thera.&lt;/b&gt; He belonged to a brahmin family of Kosala. His mother's brother was an arahant, and ordained him as soon as he grew up. Sumana soon acquired the four jhánas and fivefold aññá and, in due course, attained arahantship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ninety five kappas ago he gave a harítaka-fruit to a Pacceka Buddha who was ill (Thag.vss.330-4; ThagA.i.411f). He is evidently identical with Harítakadáyaka of the Apadána. Ap.ii.394; cf. Avadánas ii. 67-70.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;8. Sumana Thera. &lt;/b&gt;See Cúla Sumana (3). He is probably identical with Sumana (4), and may be identical with Sumana (7) if the uncle mentioned in connection with the latter is Anuruddha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thirty one kappas ago he was a garland maker and offered jasmine-flowers to Sikhí Buddha. Twenty six kappas ago he was king four times, under the name of Maháyasa. Thagg.vss.429-34; ThagA.i.457f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;9. Sumana Thera.&lt;/b&gt; He is mentioned as having lived in Andhavana with Khema. Together they visited the Buddha, and, when Khema had gone away, Sumana talked with the Buddha about arahants (A.iii.348f). He is probably identical with Sumana (7) or (8).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;10. Sumana. &lt;/b&gt;A setthi in the time of Padumuttara Buddha. He was the employer and, later, the friend of Annabhára (q.v.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;11. Sumana.&lt;/b&gt; A householder in the time of Dutthagámaní Abhaya, in the village of Bhokkanta in South Ceylon. Later he lived </data>
<data>in the village Mahámuni, in the district of Díghavápi. Ubbirí was born as his daughter and was named Sumaná. Sumaná married Lakuntaka Atimbara. DhA.iv.50f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;12. Sumana.&lt;/b&gt; A setthi of Sávatthi. He was the father of Anáthapindika and Subhúti Thera. ThagA.i.23; AA.i.125, 208.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;13. Sumana.&lt;/b&gt; A Pacceka Buddha of thirty one kappas ago, to whom, in a previous birth, Bhalliya (ThagA.i.49) and Bháradvája Thera (ThagA.i.303; cf. Ap.ii.416) gave vallikára-fruit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;14. Sumana&lt;/b&gt;. Eldest son of King Bindusára. He was killed by Asoka. Nigrodha-sámanera was his son and Sumaná his wife. Mhv.v.38, 41; Sp.i.45.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;15. Sumana.&lt;/b&gt; Son of Sanghamittá and Aggibrahmá (Mhv.v.170). He joined the Order at the age of seven; even as a sámanera he was gifted with the sixfold abhiññá and accompanied Mahinda to Ceylon (Mhv.xiii.4,18). Once when he announced that Mahinda was going to preach his voice was heard all over Ceylon (Mhv.xiv.33). In order to get relics for the cetiyas in Ceylon, he went (by air) to Papphapura (Pátaliputta), and from there to Sakka's abode, for the Buddha's right collar bone. He supervised the placing of the relics in the Thúpáráma-cetiya. Mhv.xvii.7, 21; xix.24, 42; see also Dpv.xii.13, 26, 39; xv.5f., 28, 93.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;16.

<data>Sumana (5).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;20. Sumana.&lt;/b&gt; A gardener of Kosambí. He worked for three setthis: Ghosaka, Kukkuta and Páváriya. With their permission, he entertained the Buddha one day, and it was at his house that Khujjuttará (q.v.) met and heard the Buddha. DhA.i.208f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;21. Sumana.&lt;/b&gt; A setthiputta of Rájagaha. Punna (Punnasíha) (q.v.) was his servant, but, later, Punna, as the result of giving alms to Sáriputta, became rich and Sumana married his daughter, Uttará. Sumana was an unbeliever, and Uttará, wishing for leisure in which to practise her religion, obtained for him the services of the courtezan Sirimá, paying her with the money obtained from her father. DhA.iii.104, 302f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;22. Sumana&lt;/b&gt;. A deity who lived in the fortified chamber over the gate in Jetavana. DhA.i.41.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;23.

Sujátá. &lt;/b&gt;Daughter of Senání, a landowner of the village of Senání near Uruvelá. She made a promise to the god of the banyan tree near by that she would offer a meal of milk rice to the god if she gave birth to a son. Her wish was fulfilled, the son was born, and she sent her maid, Punná, to prepare the place for the offering. This was on the very day of the Buddha's Enlightenment, and Punná, finding Gotama sitting under the banyan, thought that he was the tree god present in person to receive the offering. She brought the news to Sujátá, who, in great joy, brought the food in a golden bowl and offered it to him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gotama took the bowl to the river bank, bathed at the Suppatitthita ford and ate the food. This was his only meal for forty nine days. J.i.68f.; DhA.i.71, etc. In Lal.334-7 (267f.) nine girls are mentioned as giving food to the Buddha during his austerities. Cf. Dvy.392, where two are given, Nandá and Nandabalá.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sujátá's meal was considered one of the most important of those offered to the Buddha, and the Devas, therefore, added to it divine flavours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yasa (q.v.) was Sujátá's son, and when he attained </data>
<data>arahantship his father, who had come in search of him, became the Buddha's follower and invited him to a meal. The Buddha accepted the invitation and went with Yasa to the house. The Buddha preached at the end of the meal, and both Sujátá and Yasa's wife became sotápannas. On that day Sujátá took the threefold formula of Refuge. She thus became foremost among lay women who had taken the threefold formula (aggam upásikánam pathamam saranam gacchantínam) (SNA.i.154; D.ii.135).

Sujátá.&lt;/b&gt; Youngest sister of Visákhá. She was the daughter of Dhanañjayasetthi and was given in marriage to Anáthapindika's son. She was very haughty and obstinate. One day, when the Buddha visited Anáthapindika's house, she was scolding the servants. The Buddha stopped what he was saying, and, asking what the noise was, sent for her and described to her the seven kinds of wives that were in the world. She listened to the sermon and altered her ways (A.iv.91f.; J.ii.347f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Sujáta Játaka (No. 269) was preached to her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;9.

The ship was wrecked, and together they swam by means of a plank to a desert island. There the barber killed some birds and ate them; but the lay disciple refused a share and meditated on the Three Jewels. The Nága king of the island, moved by this, turned his body into a ship, and, with the Spirit of the Sea as helmsman, offered to take the lay disciple to Jambudípa. The barber also wished to go, but his plea was refused because he was not holy. Thereupon the lay disciple made over to him the merits of his own virtues, and the barber was taken on board. Both were conveyed to Jambudípa, where wealth was provided for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related to a holy believer who, coming one day to Jetavana, found there none of the ferry boats which crossed the Aciravatí; not wishing to return, he started to walk across the river, his mind full of thoughts of the Buddha. In the middle he lost his train of thought, and was about to sink when he again put forth effort and crossed over. The Buddha, hearing of this, told him this story, and at its conclusion the man became a sakadágámí. The Nága king was Sáriputta and the Sea spirit was the Bodhisatta.

His brothers were &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/d2_h')"&gt;Dhotodana&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/s2_sal')"&gt;Sakkodana&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/s8_suy')"&gt;Sukkodana&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/am/amitodana')"&gt;Amitodana&lt;/a&gt;, and his sisters were &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/am/amitaa')"&gt;Amitá&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/p2_ap')"&gt;Pamitá&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahamaayaa')"&gt;Máyá&lt;/a&gt; was his chief consort, and, after her death her sister &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahapajapati_gotami')"&gt;Pajápatí&lt;/a&gt; was raised to her position (Mhv.ii.15f.; Dpv.iii.45; J.i.15, etc.).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When soothsayers predicted that his son Gotama had two destinies awaiting him, either that of universal sovereignty or of Buddha hood, he exerted his utmost power to provide the prince with all kinds of luxuries in order to hold him fast to household life. It is said (E.g., J.i.54) that when &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/asita')"&gt;Asita&lt;/a&gt;, who was his father's chaplain and his own teacher, visited Suddhodana to see the newly born prince, and paid homage to the infant by allowing his feet to rest on his head, Suddhodana was filled with wonder and himself worshipped the child. And when, at the ploughing ceremony, Suddhodana saw how the jambu-tree under which the child had been placed kept its shadow immoveable in order to protect him, and that the </data>
<data>child was seated cross legged in the air, he again worshipped him (J.i.57f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later, when, in spite of all his father's efforts, the prince had left household life and was practising austerities, news was brought to Suddhodana that his son had died owing to the severity of his penances. But he refused to believe it, saying that his son would never die without achieving his goal (J.i.67). When this was afterwards related to the Buddha, he preached the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahadhammapala_jat_447')"&gt;Mahádhammapála Játaka&lt;/a&gt; and showed that in the past, too, Suddhodana had refused to believe that his son could have died even when he was shown the heap of his bones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When news reached Suddhodana that his son had reached Enlightenment, he sent a messenger to Veluvana in &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/r/raajagaha')"&gt;Rájagaha&lt;/a&gt; with ten thousand others to invite the Buddha to visit Kapilavatthu. But the messenger and his companions heard the Buddha preach, entered the Order, and forgot their mission. Nine times this happened. On the tenth occasion, Suddhodana sent &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kaaludaayii_th')"&gt;Káludáyí&lt;/a&gt; with permission for him to enter the Order on the express condition that he gave the king's invitation to the Buddha. Káludáyí kept his promise and the Buddha visited Kapilavatthu, staying in the&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/n/nigrodharama')"&gt;Nigrodháráma&lt;/a&gt;. There, in reference to a shower of rain that fell, he preached the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/vessantara_jat_547')"&gt;Vessantara Játaka&lt;/a&gt;. The next day, when Suddhodana remonstrated with the Buddha because he was seen begging in the streets of Kapilavatthu, the Buddha told him that begging was the custom of all Buddhas, and Suddhodana hearing this became a&lt;a href="http://www.palikanon.com/english/wtb/s_t/sotaapanna')"&gt;sotápanna&lt;/a&gt;. He invited the Buddha to his palace, where he entertained him, and at the end of the meal the </data>
<data>Buddha preached to the king, who became a sakadágámí (J.i.90; cf. DhA.iii.164f). He became an anágámí after hearing the&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahadhammapala_jat_447')"&gt;Mahádhammapála Játaka&lt;/a&gt;(DhA.i.99; J.iv.55), and when he was about to die, the Buddha came from Vesáli to see him and preach to him, and Suddhodana became an arahant and died as a lay arahant (ThigA.141).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nanda was Suddhodana's son by&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahapajapati_gotami')"&gt;Mahá Pajápati&lt;/a&gt;, and he had also a daughter called Sundarí Nandá. When the Buddha ordained both&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/r/raahula')"&gt;Ráhula&lt;/a&gt; and Nanda, Suddhodana was greatly distressed lest other parents should be similarly afflicted, and persuaded the Buddha to establish a rule that none should be ordained without the permission of his parents (Vin.i.82f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suddhodana was the Bodhisatta's father in numerous births, but he is specially mentioned as such by name in only a few Játakas e.g., &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/katthahaari_jak_7')"&gt;Katthahári, &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/am/aliinacitta_jat_156')"&gt;Alínacitta, &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/susiima_jat163_411')"&gt;Susíma, &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt; &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bandhanagara_jat_201')"&gt;Bandhanágára&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kosambii_jat_428')"&gt;Kosambí, &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt; &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahadhammapala_jat_447')"&gt;Mahádhammapála&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/dasaratha_jat_461')"&gt;Dasaratha, &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/h/hatthipala_jat_509')"&gt;Hatthipála, &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahaummagga_jat_546')"&gt;Maháummagga&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/vessantara_jat_547')"&gt;Vessantara. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Suddhatthaka Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fourth of the Atthakavagga of the Sutta Nipáta. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sutta was preached in reference to Candábha (q.v.) (SNA.ii.523f). Mere knowledge of various systems of philosophy cannot purify a man, for each sponsor of a system claims superiority for his views, and all go from one teacher to another and are never calm and thoughtful. But the wise, who have understood the Dhamma, are never led away by passion. They do not embrace anything in the world as the highest. SN.vss.788-95.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

He had three daughters: Nandá, Nandavatí and Sundarínandá. After death he was born as a golden goose, and, remembering his past birth, he flew to where his wife and daughters lived and gave one of his golden feathers. This happened several times, till at last his wife planned to pull out all his feathers. Now the feathers taken from a golden goose, against his wish, cease to be golden and become like the feathers of a crane. The woman discovered this when she had pulled out all his feathers, so she flung him into a barrel and fed him there. Later white feathers grew on him, and he flew away never to return.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to Thulla-Nandá (q.v.). One day she went to a bailiff's house for some garlic, as he was in the habit of giving this to the nuns. But the supply was finished, and she was asked to get some from the field. She went there and took away a large quantity, and the bailiff was very angry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thulla Nandá is identified with the greedy woman and her three sisters with the three daughters.

Sirivaddha Thera.&lt;/b&gt; His father was a rich man of Rájagaha and he was present when the Buddha visited Bimbisára. Impressed by the Buddha's majesty, Sirivaddha joined the Order and lived in a forest near Vebhára and Pandava meditating. A great storm arose one day, and the Thera, cooled by the rain, was able to concentrate his mind and win arahantship (Thag.vs.41, ThagA.i.107f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is probably identical with Kinkhanikapupphiya Thera of </data>
<data>the Apadána (Ap.i.204). In the past he offered a kinkhani flower to Vipassí Buddha. Seventy seven kappas ago he was a king, named Bhímaratha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;11. Sirivaddha. &lt;/b&gt;A setthi of Mithilá, father of Mahosadha. He is identified with Suddhodana. J.vi. 331, 478.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;12.

He fled to Jambudípa, through fear of Kassapa I., and became a monk in the Bodhimanda-vihára. There, because of a mango which he presented to the community, he came to be known as Ambasámanera.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Moggallána I., he brought the Buddha's Hair Relic to Ceylon and was greatly honoured by the king. Silákála returned to the lay life, and Moggallána appointed him sword bearer to the relic - hence his name, Asiggáhaka-Silákála.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He married the king's sister and also the daughter of Upatissa III. He then returned to the Malaya district, where he rebelled against Upatissa. He defeated the king's son, Kassapa, who committed suicide, and when Upatissa died of grief, Silákála became king under the name of Ambasámanera-Silákála, ruling for thirteen years (524-37 A.C.).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He had three sons: Moggallána, Dáthápabhuti and Upatissa.

Beings are born in that world as a result of developing the third &lt;a href="http://www.palikanon.com/english/wtb/g_m/jhaana')"&gt;jhána&lt;/a&gt;, and their life span is sixty four kappas (MA.i.553 and SA.i.162; but see A.ii.127, 129, where their life is given as four kappas). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They are filled and pervaded with happiness and are serenely blissful; they experience only sublime happiness, unlike the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/aa/aabhassara')"&gt;Abhassará&lt;/a&gt;, who exclaim in their joy.

He was a follower of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/n/niganthaa')"&gt;Niganthas&lt;/a&gt;. When the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddha')"&gt;Buddha&lt;/a&gt; visited Vesáli, Síha, having heard reports of his greatness, wished to see him, but &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/n/nigantha_nataputta')"&gt;Nigantha Nátaputta&lt;/a&gt; dissuaded him, saying that &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/g/gotama')"&gt;Gotama&lt;/a&gt; denied the result of actions and was not worth a visit. But in the end Síha, accompanied by five hundred chariots, went to the Buddha. Having discovered in conversation with the Buddha that he was falsely accused of preaching wrong doctrines, Síha declared himself the Buddha's follower. The Buddha accepted his adherence on condition that he would continue to give alms to any Niganthas who sought them at his house. This generosity made Síha honour the Buddha even more highly, and he invited him and the monks to a meal on the next day. Meat formed one of the dishes, and the Niganthas went about Vesáli crying that Síha had killed a large ox to provide meat for the Buddha and his monks and that the food had been accepted. This was the occasion for the formulation of the rule that no monk should eat flesh where he has reason to believe that the animal had been specially killed for him (Vin.i.233f.; A.iv.179f.; see also the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/t/telovaada_jat_246')"&gt;Telováda Játaka&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Síha was, at one time, one of the most famous patrons of the Niganthas, the others being &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/upaali')"&gt;Upáligahapati&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/n/naalandaa')"&gt;Nálandá&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/va/vappa')"&gt;Vappa&lt;/a&gt;, the </data>
<data>Sákiyan of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kapilavatthu')"&gt;Kapilavatthu&lt;/a&gt; (AA.ii.751).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Anguttara Nikáya (A.iii.38f; iv.79f ) contains two discussions, in more or less identical terms, in which Síha asks the Buddha if it is possible to show the visible results of giving. The Buddha, by means of a counter question, elicits from Síha that the giver has his reward in this world itself, and in the end Síha acknowledges that he has experienced the benefits which the Buddha set forth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Síha had a niece, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/siiha_therii')"&gt;Síhá&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Síha Thera. &lt;/b&gt;He was born in the family of a rájá in the Malla country and visited the Buddha. The Buddha preached to him a sermon suitable to his temperament, and he entered the Order. He lived in the forest in meditation, but his thoughts were distracted. The Buddha, seeing this, went through the air and spoke to him alone, asking him to persevere. Thus incited, he strove hard and attained arahantship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was once a kinnara on the banks of the Candabhágá, and seeing Atthadassí Buddha journeying through the air, he stood still, gazing at him with clasped hands. The Buddha alighted and sat under a tree, where the kinnara offered him flowers and sandalwood. Síha was three times king, under the name of Rohiní (ThagA.i.179). He is probably identical with Candanapújaka of the Apadána. Ap.i.165.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Síha. &lt;/b&gt;A &lt;a name="novice"&gt;novice&lt;/a&gt; who entered the Order at the age of seven and was a great favourite among the monks for his charm. He was much liked by the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddha')"&gt;Buddha&lt;/a&gt;. He was a student under Nágita, and was with him when the Buddha once stayed in Vesáli. Seeing a great number of people coming to visit the Buddha, he informed Nágita of this, and, with his permission, went to tell </data>

This led to the preaching of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahali_s')"&gt;Maháli Sutta&lt;/a&gt; (D.i.151). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buddhaghosa adds (DA.i.310) that Nágita was fat and lazy and that most of his work was done by Síha, who was his sister's son.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4.

He escaped, however, and the Adhikári Mañju was sent to seize him. Súkarabhátu became the commander-in-chief of the rebels and caused great damage to Parakkamabáhu's forces. It was not until Damiládhikári and Lankápura Deva concentrated all their attention on him that he could be defeated. He died fighting, near Mahánágahula.

Now Sígiri, about thirty eight miles south east of Anurádhapura (Cv.Trs.i.42, n.1). Perhaps the rock itself resembled the form of a recumbent lion, especially the forepart of his body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Kassapa I. had slain his father, he took refuge there, clearing the land about the rock, surrounding it with a wall, and building a staircase to it in the form of a lion. Kassapa and his retinue lived in the fortress till he was defeated by his brother Moggallána, and then killed himself (Cv.xxxix.2f). Mention is made of several viháras on Síhagiri, among them being Dalha and Dáthákondañña, which Moggallána I. gave to the Dhammaruci and Ságalika schools. Cv.xxxix.41. Perhaps the fortress was originally a centre of the Dhammarucikas, and Kassapa may have borrowed from them the idea of making use of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;King Sanghatissa, his son, and his minister, were executed on Síhagiri, at the command of Moggallána III., (Cv.xliv.32f) and later Moggallána himself was slain there by Silámeghavanna (Cv.xliv.60). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rock is now famous for its frescoes, which are very similar to those of Ajantá.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

One day the Buddha saw that Suníta was destined for arahantship and visited him at dawn, as he was sweeping the street and collecting the scraps in his basket. Seeing the Buddha, he was filled with awe, and, finding no place to stand, stood stiffly against a wall. The Buddha approached him and asked if he would like to be a monk. He expressed great joy, and the Buddha ordained him with the &quot;ehi bhikkhu&quot; pabbajjá. Then he took Suníta to the vihára and taught him a subject of meditation, by which he won arahantship. Then many men and gods came to pay homage to him, and Suníta preached to them on his way of attainment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past he had spoken disparagingly of a Pacceka Buddha.

He had a brother Nanda. When the boys grew up their parents wanted them to marry, but they refused, and declared their desire to become ascetics after the death of their parents. Then the parents suggested that they should all, at once, become ascetics; this they did, and lived in a pleasant grove in the Himálaya. After some time, because Nanda brought unripe fruit for his parents in spite of Sona's warning, Sona dismissed him. Nanda thereupon sought Manoja, and, with his magic power, helped him to win various kingdoms in Jambudípa, bringing into subjection one hundred and one kings in seven years, seven months and seven days. All these kings Manoja brought to Brahmavaddhana, where he caroused with them. Nanda spent his time in the Suvannaguhá in the Himálaya, obtaining his alms from Uttarakuru. At the end of the seventh day Manoja looked for Nanda, who, reading his thoughts, appeared before him. Manoja wished to give some token of his gratitude, and Nanda asked that he should intercede for him with Sona and win for him Sona's forgiveness. Together they went to Sona accompanied by a large retinue. Sona explained why he had forbidden Nanda, to look after their parents, and Nanda asked his forgiveness for having given his parents unripe fruit in his eagerness to wait on them. Sona forgave him, and they all lived together once more, while the kings returned to their countries, where they ruled wisely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The occasion for the story is the same as that for the Sáma Játaka (q.v.), regarding a monk who supported his mother. Nanda is identified with Ananda and Manoja with Sáriputta (J.v.312, p.332).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story is also given in the Cariyapitaka. Cyp.iii.v.&lt;/p&gt;</data>

She was very beautiful, and was so called because she had a golden mole between her breasts. When the king heard that she wanted to marry a man of high lineage he challenged her to win Uddála of Pañcamadhurá who hated women. She accepted the challenge and went with her father. On the way seven kings offered to marry her, but she refused them. Uddála fell in love with her at sight and lived with her for four months, neglecting all his duties. His pupils were enraged and killed Suvannatilaká. He thereupon jumped into her pyre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In her last life Suvannatilaká had been born in Anurádhapura.

He tells the Buddha that he was formerly a king, a great giver of gifts at the four gates of his capital. Then the women of the court wished also to give, and he allowed them to give at one gate; thus some of his own gifts came back to him. Then the nobles, the army, the brahmins and the householders wished to do the same, and he allowed them to distribute gifts, each class at one gate, and the result was that his gifts were not given at all. He then decreed that out of all his revenues one half should be given away from the source and only half sent to him (S.i.57f). Buddhaghosa adds (SA.i.90) that Serí was king of Sindhava and Sodhika, and that, at each gate, he gave away one thousand pieces daily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Simsapá Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha, while staying in Simsapávana in Kosambí, takes up a handful of leaves and tells the monks that the things he has discovered and not revealed, compared to those he has revealed, are as the handful of leaves to the leaves in the forest. What he has not revealed does not conduce to tranquillity, Nibbána. He has revealed Ill, its cause, cessation, and the way thereto; this does conduce to Nibbána. S.v.437.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Sívaka. &lt;/b&gt;A Yakkha who helped &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/anaathapindika')"&gt;Anáthapindika&lt;/a&gt; to find the Buddha at &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/sitavana')"&gt;Sítavana&lt;/a&gt; (Vin.ii.155f; S.i.211). He is mentioned among the chief Yakkhas to be invoked by followers of the Buddha in time of need (D.iii.205).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Sívaka.&lt;/b&gt; See Moliya-Sívaka.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Sívaka. &lt;/b&gt;The physician of King Sivi. See the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/sivi_jat_499')"&gt;Sivi Játaka&lt;/a&gt;. He is identified with Ananda. J.iv.412.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Sívaka Thera.&lt;/b&gt; The nephew of Vanavaccha. When Vanavaccha's sister heard that he had left the world and was living in the forest, she sent her son Sívaka to be ordained under the Elder and to wait upon him. He lived in the forest with his uncle, and one day, while on his way to the village, fell very ill. The Elder, on finding that he did not return, went in search of him, and, finding him ill, tended him; but as dawn drew near, he suggested that they should both return to the forest as he had never before stayed in the village since joining the Order. Sívaka agreed, and entered the forest leaning on his uncle's arm. There Sívaka won arahantship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thirty one kappas ago he had seen Vessabhú Buddha in the forest and offered him a kásumárika fruit (Thag.vs.14; ThagA.i.60f). He is probably identical with Kásumáraphaladáyaka of the Apadána. Ap.ii.445.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;5. Sívaka Thera. &lt;/b&gt;He belonged to a brahmin family of Rájagaha, and, when he had acquired a good education, became a Paribbájaka. Then he heard the Buddha preach, entered the Order, and became an arahant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ninety one kappas ago he had given Vipassí Buddha a bowl </data>

He left the world and lived in the forest, but there he lacked food and drinks and was troubled by heat and cold and insects.

He resolved to acquire this eminence during his birth in the time of Padumuttara Buddha. He was born, in this Buddha age, in a banker's family in Sávatthi and became a follower of the heretics. One day the Buddha, seeing Súra's fitness for conversion, went to his door for alms. Out of respect for the Buddha, Súra invited him in, and, giving him a comfortable seat, entertained him to a meal. At the end of the meal, when the Buddha returned thanks, Súra became a sotápanna. Some time after the Buddha had left, Mára, disguised as the Buddha, visited Súra and, in reply to Súra's questioning, said that he had returned to contradict a wrong statement which he had made earlier. He had said that all the sankháras were impermanent, etc., but, on further reflection, he had come to the conclusion that only some sankháras were of that nature. Súra recognized Mára and drove him away. AA.i.215; cf. DA.iii.864.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

He held great festivals in Mahiyangana, Sumanakúta and Anurádhapura, and built a suburb called Kundasálá, where he lived. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The temple of the Tooth Relic, built by his father, he adorned with paintings of thirty two Játakas. He showed great honour to Saranankara-sámanera and gave him a golden casket studded with seven hundred jewels.

In the time of the Buddha there was a caravan route between Soreyya and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/t/takkasilaa')"&gt;Takkasilá&lt;/a&gt; (DhA.i.326). There was also a direct route from &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/veranjaa')"&gt;Verañjá&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/payaga')"&gt;Payágatittha&lt;/a&gt;, passing through Soreyya, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sankassa')"&gt;Sankassa&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kannakujja')"&gt;Kannakuja&lt;/a&gt; (Vin.iii.11; see also &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/r/revata')"&gt;Soreyya-Revata&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At one time &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/maha_kaccaana')"&gt;Mahá Kaccáyana&lt;/a&gt; lived near Soreyya (DhA.i.325). It was evidently a very ancient city, for &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/anomadassii')"&gt;Anomadassí&lt;/a&gt; Buddha is mentioned as having twice preached there once to King &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/i_/isidatta')"&gt;Isidatta&lt;/a&gt; and again to the king of Soreyya; and it was there that he held his first assembly of monks (BuA.143, 144). &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/vessabhuu')"&gt;Vessabhú&lt;/a&gt; Buddha also preached there later to a very large assembly (BuA.206).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Soreyya.&lt;/b&gt; A setthiputta of Soreyya. Once, when he and a friend with a large retinue were driving out of the city to bathe, he saw &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/maha_kaccaana')"&gt;Mahá Kaccáyana&lt;/a&gt; adjusting his robe before entering the city for alms. Soreyya saw the Elder's body, and wished that he could make him his wife or that his wife's body might become in colour like the Elder's. Immediately Soreyya turned into a woman, and, hiding from his companions, went with a caravan bound for &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/t/takkasilaa')"&gt;Takkasilá&lt;/a&gt;. Arrived at Takkasilá, he became the wife of the Treasurer of that city and had </data>
<data>two sons. He had already two sons in Soreyya, born to him before his transformation.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some time after, he saw his former friend driving in a carriage through Takkasilá, and, sending a slave woman to him, invited him to the house and entertained him. The friend was unable to recognize him till he revealed the truth. Thereupon they both returned to Soreyya and invited Mahá Kaccáyana to a meal. Soreyya fell at his feet, confessed his fault, and asked for forgiveness. When the Elder pardoned him, he once more became a man. He entered the Order under the Elder and went with him to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/saavatthi')"&gt;Sávatthi&lt;/a&gt;. There people having heard his story worried him with questions. He therefore retired into solitude, and, developing insight, became an arahant. Before that, when people asked him which of his children he loved best, he would say: &quot;Those to whom I gave birth while a woman&quot;; but after attaining arahantship he would say: &quot;My affections are set on no one.&quot; DhA.i.324ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

It was the discussion between these two, in the Ambalatthiká park, regarding the virtues of the Buddha, his Dhamma and his Order, which led to the preaching of the Brahmajála Sutta (D.i.1).

There he met the Buddha and his monks and gave them fruit. He belonged to a khattiya family in the time of Kassapa Buddha, but through pride of birth and learning used to detract his colleagues hence his birth in a low caste in his last life.

Dpv.xviii.38.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;5. Soná.&lt;/b&gt; A Therí. She was declared foremost among nuns for capacity of effort (áraddhaviriyánam). She belonged to the family of a clansman of Sávatthi, and because, after marriage, she had ten sons and daughters, she came to be called &lt;b&gt;Bahuputtiká&lt;/b&gt;. When her husband renounced the world, she distributed her wealth among her children, keeping nothing for herself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her children soon ceased to show her any respect, and she entered the Order in her old age. She waited on the nuns and studied most of the night. Soon her strenuous energy became known to the Buddha, and he, sending forth a ray of glory, spoke to her. Then she attained arahantship. Her resolve to win eminence was made in the time of Padumuttara Buddha, when she was the daughter of a rich setthi. (A.i.25; Thig.vss.102-6; ThigA.96f.; Ap.ii.576; cf. the story of Bahuputtiká at DhA.ii.276f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Anguttara Commentary says (AA.i.199) that after she became an arahant she wished her colleagues to know this because they had been in the habit of constantly finding fault with her for various things, and she did not wish them to continue doing so and thereby commit a sin. She therefore filled a vessel with water, which she heated by her iddhi-power, using no fire. When the nuns came to look for water she told them that if they wanted warm </data>
<data>water they could have it from the vessel. They found the water hot, and understood. Then they begged her forgiveness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;6. Soná. &lt;/b&gt;An eminent teacher of the Vinaya in Jambudípa. Dpv.xviii.10.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

She heard the Buddha preach and entered the Order. She was full of faith, and, when she went to hear the Buddha preach, would gaze at his beauty of personality. The Buddha, realizing her nature, preached so that her faith might reach its culmination, and, in due course, she became an arahant. Later she was declared chief of nuns who had attained release by faith (saddhádhimuttánam).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Padumuttara Buddha she belonged to a minister's family, and once went with her father to hear the Buddha preach. Full of faith, she entered the Order, and, hearing a nun declared foremost of those who had faith, she wished for similar eminence (A.i.25; AA.i.206f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Apadána (Ap.ii.603f), she was the mother of Sigála(-ka), to whom the Buddha preached the sutta regarding the worship of the directions (evidently the Sigálováda Sutta). She heard the sermon and became a sotápanna.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

His name was Sílava. One day he saw a forester of Benares who had lost his way, and, feeling compassion for him, took him to his own dwelling, fed him with all kinds of fruit, and then, taking him to the edge of the forest, set him on his way to Benares. The wretched man noted all the landmarks, and, on reaching the city, entered into an agreement with ivory workers to supply them with Sílava's tusks. He then returned to the forest and begged Sílava for a part of his tusks, pleading poverty and lack of livelihood. Sílava allowed the ends of his tusks to be sawn off. The man returned again and again, until, at last, Sílava allowed him to dig out the stumps as well. As the man was on his way back to Benares, the earth opened and swallowed him up into the fires of hell. A tree sprite, who had witnessed all this, spoke a stanza illustrating the evils of ingratitude.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related in reference to Devadatta's wickedness; he is identified with the forester and Sáriputta with the tree sprite (J.i.319-22; the story is referred to in the Milinda-Pañha, p.202).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The birth as Sílava is mentioned among those in which the Bodhisatta practised síla páramitá to perfection.

Later, owing to his association with Vimala Thera, he entered the Order and lived with him. (But according to ThagA.i.377, Vimala was ordained by Somamitta). But finding Vimala given to sloth and laziness, Somamitta left him and joined Mahá Kassapa, under whose direction he soon attained arahantship. Later he visited Vimala and rebuked him. Vimala then put forth effort and became an arahant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Somamitta was a householder in the time of Sikhí Buddha, and, very pleased with the Buddha, he picked some kimsuka-flowers from a tree and offered them to him (Thag.vs.147f ; ThagA.i.267f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is perhaps identical with Kimsukapupphiya Thera of the Apadána.

He asks the Buddha if the monks have really won all they profess or if some of them are extravagant in their professions. The Buddha explains that some of the monks are worldly, their hearts set on material things; others are free from worldly bondage, their hearts set on permanence; yet others on various jhánas; while the last have their hearts set on nibbána; all these will act according to their beliefs. The Buddha then explains further, using the simile of a surgeon: a patient is wounded by a poisoned arrow, even when the surgeon has removed the poison the patient must go slowly till the wound is healed. Craving is the arrow; the wound represents the six sense organs within; ignorance is the poison; mindfulness is the surgeon's probing; Noble Understanding is the surgeon's knife; and the Tathágata the surgeon.

One day the elephant ate too much and fell ill. The brahmin went in search of wild fruit for it, but before he could return, the animal was dead. The ascetic was filled with grief. Sakka (the Bodhisatta) saw this and, appearing before him, reminded him that it was not for this that he had left wife, wealth and children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related in reference to a monk who had ordained a novice, and, when the latter died, he was full of grief.

It was near &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/uruvelaa')"&gt;Uruvelá&lt;/a&gt; and on the banks of the&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/n/neranjara')"&gt;Nerañjará&lt;/a&gt; (J.i.68).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The name seems originally to have been Senánigama (E.g., S.i.106; Vin.i.21; M.i.166, 240).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buddhaghosa himself does not seem to have been sure of the spelling. He says (SA.i.135) it was so called because it was occupied by soldiers at the beginning of the kappa (pathamakappikánam senáya nivitthokáse patitthitagámo) or because it was the village of Sujátá's father Senání (Sujátáya vá pitu Senání náma nigamo).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Lalitavistara (p.311, [248]) calls it Senápatigráma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Once, when the Buddha was there with a large number of monks, Mira tempted them in the guise of a jatanduva-brahmin (S.i.117). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The village was the birthplace of Bandhura Thera (ThagA.i.208).

The cub was like his sire in appearance, but like his clam invoice. One day, after rain, when the lions were gambolling and roaring together, the cub thought to roar too, and yelped like a jackal. Thereupon all the lions at once fell silent. When the Bodhisatta was told of this by another cub he advised the jackal cub to keep quiet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related in reference to Kokálika's attempt to preach, Kokálika is identified with the jackal voiced cub and Ráhula with his brother.

While in labour his mother fell into a long and deep swoon, and her kinsfolk, thinking her dead, took her to the cemetery and prepared for cremation. But a spirit prevented the fire from burning with a storm of wind and rain, and they went away. The child was safely born and the mother died. The spirit, in human shape, took the child and put it in the watchman's hut, feeding it for a time. After that the watchman adopted it, and the child grew up with the watchman's son, Suppiya (q.v.). He was called Sopáka, (the &quot;waif&quot;) because he was born in the cemetery. When he was seven years old he came under the notice of the Buddha, who visited him in the cemetery. Gladdened by the Buddha's teaching, he sought his father's consent and entered the Order. The Buddha gave him, as his subject of meditation, the thought of mettá, and Sopika, developing insight, soon attained arahantship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Kakusandha Buddha, he was a householder's son and gave the Buddha some bíjapúra-fruits. He also provided three monks with milk rice daily to the end of his life. In another birth he gave a meal of milk rice to a Pacceka Buddha (Thag.vs.33; ThagA.i.94f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is perhaps identical with Vibhítakamiñjaya of the Apadána. Ap.ii.396.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Sopáka Thera. &lt;/b&gt;He was born as the child of a cemetery keeper and was therefore called Sopáka. Others say that he was born in a trader's family and that Sopáka was merely a name. Four months after birth his father died suddenly and he was adopted by his uncle. When he was only seven years old, his uncle took him to a charnel field because he quarrelled with his cousin, bound his hands, and tied him fast to a corpse, hoping that the jackals </data>
<data>would eat him. At midnight the jackals came and the child started crying. The Buddha, seeing Sopáka's destiny for arahantship, sent a ray of glory, and, by the Buddha's power, the boy broke his bonds and stood before the Buddha's Gandhakuti, a sotápanna. His mother started seeking for him, and the uncle telling her nothing, she came to the Buddha, thinking &quot;The Buddhas know all, past, present and future.&quot; When she came, the Buddha, by his iddhi-power, made the boy invisible and taught her the Dhamma, saying that sons are no shelter, blood bonds no refuge. As she listened she became a sotápanna and the boy an arahant. Then the Buddha revealed the boy's presence to his mother, and she allowed him to enter the Order. Some time later the Buddha, wishing to confer on him the higher ordination, asked him the questions which came to be known as the &quot;Kumárapañhá&quot; Sopáka answered these, and the Buddha, satisfied, gave him the upasampadá.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sopáka had been a brahmin in the time of Siddhattha Buddha, expert in the Vedas. He later became an ascetic and lived on a mountain. The Buddha, foreseeing his imminent death, visited him. The brahmin spread for him a seat of flowers. The Buddha preached to him on impermanence and left through the air. Thag.vss.480-6; ThagA.i.477f.; Ap.i.64f.; KhpA.76; see also DhA.iv.176f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Serissaka. &lt;/b&gt;A &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/y/yakkha')"&gt;Yakkha&lt;/a&gt; chieftain to be invoked in time of need by followers of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddha')"&gt;Buddha&lt;/a&gt;. D.iii.205.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2.

The deva of the vimána was also called Serísaka, and is evidently to be identified with the Yakkha Serissaka. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Páyási was born in the Serísaka-vimána, because, though he gave generously, he was careless about the manner of giving. &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/vessavana')"&gt;Vessavana&lt;/a&gt; therefore stationed him in a desert, devoid of shade or water, to protect travellers from the dangers which beset them at the hands of non-humans. He came across some merchants from &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/anga')"&gt;Anga&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/magadha')"&gt;Magadha&lt;/a&gt; who had lost their way while journeying to&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/sindhu')"&gt;Sindhusovíra&lt;/a&gt;. He revealed to them his identity, and they offered to hold a festival in his honour when they reached safety. But he suggested that gifts be given in his name to a pious man, named Sambhava, who was in their company. Later Sambhava joined the Order and became an arahant (Vv.vii.10; VvA.331).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is said (DA.iii.814; cf. ThagA.i.103) that the vimána was called Serísaka because there was, at its entrance, a large serísa-tree, </data>
<data>which bore fruit once in fifty years. Gavampati had earlier occupied the vimána, when born as a devaputta. After his rebirth among humans, the vimána was empty till occupied by Páyási. But Gavampati sometimes visited it even after becoming an arahant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

ThigA.221; SNA.i.260.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;5. Subhadda. &lt;/b&gt;A barber of Atumá. He entered the Order and resented having to observe various rules, great and small. When the Buddha died and the monks stood weeping, Subhadda asked them to rejoice instead, saying: &quot;We are well rid of the Mahásamana; we shall now do just as we like.&quot; Mahá Kassapa heard this while he was on his way from Pává to Kusinára, and it was this remark which made him decide to hold the First Council after the Buddha's death (Vin.ii.284f; D.ii.162; Mhv.iii.6).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Subhadda had been a sámanera at the time of the Buddha's visit to Atumá, and had two sons before he joined the Order. When he heard that the Buddha was coming, he sent for his two sons and gave orders for various foods to be collected to feed the Buddha and the twelve hundred and fifty monks. The Buddha arrived in the evening and took up his residence in Atumá. All night long Subhadda went about giving instructions regarding the preparation of the food. In the morning of the next day the Buddha went out for alms, and Subhadda </data>
<data>approached him and invited him to partake of the food which he had prepared. But the Buddha questioned him, and, discovering what he had done, refused to accept the meal, forbidding the monks to do so too. This angered Subhadda, and he awaited an opportunity of expressing his disapproval of the Buddha. This opportunity came when he heard of the Buddha's death. DA.ii.599; cf. Vin.i.249f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;6. Subhadda Thera. &lt;/b&gt;He was a brahmin of high rank (of the udicca-bráhmana-mahá-sálakula), and, having become a Paribbájaka, was living in Kusinárá when the Buddha went there on his last journey. Having heard that the Buddha would die in the third watch of the night, Subhadda went to the sála grove, where the Buddha lay on his death bed, and asked Ananda for permission to see him. But three times Ananda refused the request, saying that the Buddha was weary. The Buddha overheard the conversation and asked Subhadda to come in. Subhadda asked the Buddha if there were any truth in the teachings of other religious instructors. The Buddha said he had no time to discuss that, but that any system devoid of the Noble Eightfold Path was useless for salvation, and he taught Subhadda the Doctrine. Subhadda asked to be allowed to join the Order, and the Buddha gave Amanda special permission to admit him at once without waiting for the usual probationary period. Subhadda dwelt in solitude and in meditation and soon became an arahant. He was the last disciple to be converted by the Buddha (D.ii.148ff.; cf. DhA.iii.376f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buddhaghosa says (DA.ii.590) that when the Buddha gave him permission to ordain Subhadda, Ananda took him outside, poured water over his head, made him repeat the formula of the impermanence of the body, shaved off his hair and beard, clad him in yellow robes, made him repeat the Three Refuges, and then led him back to the Buddha. The Buddha himself admitted Subhadda to the </data>
<data>higher ordination and gave him a subject for meditation. Subhadda took this and, walking up and down in a quiet part of the grove, attained arahantship and came and sat down beside the Buddha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past, Subhadda and Aññáta Kondañña had been brothers. They had a cornfield, and the elder (Aññáta Kondañña) gave the first fruits of the corn to the monks in nine stages. The younger (Subhadda) found fault with him for damaging the corn. They then divided the field, thus settling the dispute (DA.ii.588). Subhadda rubbed the dead body of Padumuttara Buddha with sandalwood and other fragrant essences and placed a banner on his thúpa. In the time of Kassapa Buddha, the Buddha's aggasávaka, Tissa, was, Subhadda's son. Subhadda spoke disparagingly of him, hence his tardiness in meeting the Buddha in his last life. Subhadda died on the day of his ordination and arahantship (Ap.i.100f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The conversation between the Buddha and Subhadda forms the topic of a dilemma in the Milinda-Pañha (p.130). Subhadda's ordination was the Buddha's last &quot;official&quot; act. KhA.,p.89.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;7. Subhadda.&lt;/b&gt; A lay disciple of Nátiká. He was an anágámí and was born in the Suddhavásá, never to be reborn. D.ii.92; S.v.348f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;p&gt;He belonged to a rich family of Velukantaka. Some give his name as Vásula. He was a close friend of Kumáputta, and, on hearing that the latter had left the world, he, too, visited the Buddha with a similar end in view. The Buddha preached to him, and he entered the Order and lived on a hill with Kumáputta, engaged in meditation. But they were disturbed by the comings and goings of numerous monks, and, owing to the disturbance, spurred on to greater endeavour, Sudatta put forth effort and became an arahant. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ninety four kappas ago, in the time of Siddhattha Buddha, he was a householder, and going into the forest, he made walking sticks, which he gave to the monks (Thag.vs.37; ThagA.i.101f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is evidently identical with Dandadáyaka of the Apadána, and is generally known as Kumáputtasaháya Thera.

Sukká Therí. &lt;/b&gt;She belonged to a householder's family of Rájagaha, and, very impressed by the Buddha's majesty when he visited Rájagaha, she became a lay believer. Later she heard Dhammadinná preach, and entered the Order under her, attaining arahantship not long after.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Vipassí Buddha she had been a nun, and, after a sojourn in Tusita, a nun again in the time of Sikhí, Vessabhú, Kakusandha, Konágamana and Kassapa Buddhas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In her last life she was a great preacher, at the head of five hundred nuns. One particular sermon to the nuns is specially mentioned, and a tree sprite, living at the end of the nun's cankamana, went about Rájagaha, singing Sukká's praises. People, hearing the sprite, flocked to hear Sukká.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thig.vss.54-6; ThigA.57f ; Ap.ii.605f.; the incident of the tree sprite’s praise is twice mentioned in the Samyutta as well. There the sprite is called a Yakkha (S.i.212); in the second account (ibid., 213) it says that the Yakkha's praise was owing to a meal given to Sukká by a lay follower of Rájagaha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2.

One day, while Supatta and Suphassá were out looking for food, they noticed that the king's cook had prepared a host of dishes and had left some of them out in the open to cool. Suphassá sniffed at the food but said nothing. The next day, however, she wished to stay behind and taste some of the king's food. Supatta consulted his captain, and they went with a large number of crows, whom they set in groups round the kitchen. As the cook was taking the dishes on a pingo, Sumukha, as arranged, attacked him with beak and claw and made him drop them. Then the crows ate their fill and flew away with food for Supatta and Suphassá. Sumukha was caught and taken before the king, who has seen what had happened. When questioned by the king, he told him the whole story and said that he would gladly lose his life for his king, Supatta. The king sent for Supatta and listened to his preaching, and, thereafter protecting all creatures, practised the good life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to Sáriputta, who had obtained from Pasenadi a meal of red rice and new ghee, flavoured with red fish, because he had been informed by Ráhula that Bimbádevi (Ráhulamátá) suffered from gastric trouble and would be cured by this food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The king of Benares is identified with Ananda, Sumukha with Sáriputta, and Suphassá with Ráhulamátá.

PSA. 319; Vsm.710). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bodhisattas are never born there (SNA.i.50; BuA.224).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The  Suddhávásá are described as buddhánam khandháváratthánasadisá. Sometimes, for asankheyyas of kappas, when no Buddhas are born, these worlds remain empty (AA.ii.808; cf. MA.i.30). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha is mentioned as having visited the Suddhávásá (E.g., D.ii.50). When a Buddha is about to be born, the inhabitants of the Suddhávásá insert a knowledge of the signs of a Great Being in the Vedas and teach this among men in the guise of brahmins, calling such knowledge buddhamanta. Men learn it and are thus able to recognize a Great Being (MA.ii.761; SNA.ii.448). The inhabitants of the Suddhávásá know how many Buddhas will be born in any particular kappa by observing the number of lotuses which spring up on the site of the Bodhi-pallanka when the earth gradually emerges after the destruction of the world (DA.ii.411). It is the Suddhávásá Brahmás who provide the four omens which lead to a Bodhisatta's renunciation in his last lay life. See, e.g., DA.ii.455f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Sirikálakanni Játaka (No.382). &lt;/b&gt;The Bodhisatta was once a merchant of Benares, and, because his household observed the rules of piety, he came to be called Suciparivára (&quot;pure household&quot;). He kept an unused couch and bed for anyone who might come to his house and was purer than himself. One day Kálakanní, daughter of Virúpakka and Sirí, Dhatarattha’s daughter, went to bathe in Anotatta, and a quarrel arose as to which should bathe first. As neither the Four Regent Gods nor Sakka were willing to decide, they referred the two goddesses to Suciparivára. Kálakanní first appeared before him in blue raiment and jewels, and, on being asked what were her qualities, she told him, and was asked to vanish from his sight. Then came Sirí, diffusing yellow radiance, and the Bodhisatta, discovering her identity and her virtues, welcomed her and offered her his unused couch. Thus was the dispute settled. The bed used by Sirí came to be called Sirisaya, hence the origin of Sirisayana.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sirí is identified with Uppalavanná. J.iii. 257-64.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Suppiyá.&lt;/b&gt; An upásaka of Benares. Her husband was Suppiyá, and they were both greatly devoted to the Order. One day, while on a visit to the monastery, Suppiyá saw a sick monk who needed a meat broth. On her return home, she sent an attendant to fetch meat; but there was none to be had in the whole of Benares. She therefore, with a knife, cut a piece of flesh from her thigh and gave it to her servant to make into soup for the monk. She then went to her room and lay on her bed. When Suppiya returned and discovered what had happened he was overjoyed, and, going to the monastery, invited the Buddha to a meal the next day. The Buddha accepted the invitation, and when, on the next day, he arrived with his monks, he asked for Suppiyá. On hearing that she was ill, he desired that she be brought to see him. At the moment when the Buddha saw her wound was healed, covered with good skin, on which grew fine hairs as on the rest of her body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was as a result of this incident that the Buddha lay down a rule forbidding monks to eat human flesh, even when willingly given (Vin.i.216f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suppiyá is given as an example of one whose good deeds bore fruit in this very life (Mil.115; cf.291). She was declared by the Buddha foremost among women who waited on the sick (A.i.26), an eminence she had resolved to win in the time of Padumuttara Buddha. AA.i.244f.; she is mentioned in a list of eminent women lay disciples (A.iv.348).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Suppiyá.&lt;/b&gt; One of the five daughters of the third </data>

When the ascetics came to Benares for the rainy season, the king invited their leader to stay behind while the others returned at the end of the rains. One day the Bodhisatta's chief disciple visited him and sat down on a mat by his side, exclaiming: &quot;Oh happiness, what happiness!&quot; The king came to pay his respects to the teacher, but was displeased because the disciple still sat there. The Bodhisatta explained that the disciple had also been a king who had renounced his kingship for the ascetic life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related in reference to Bhaddiya who, after he had won arahantship, kept on saying &quot;aho sukham, aho sukham,&quot; because he realized how full of fear he had been as a layman and how free from fear he was as an arahant.

The king, seeing him as he went begging, invited him to the palace, fed him, and urged him to continue to stay in the park. The Pacceka Buddha agreed to do so, and the king told Sumangala to look after him. One day the Pacceka Buddha went away to a village, and, after an absence of some days, returned in the evening. Putting away his bowl and robe, he sat on a stone seat. Sumangala, looking in the park for some meat in order to feed some relations who had suddenly arrived, saw the Pacceka Buddha, and, taking him for a deer, shot him. The Pacceka Buddha revealed his identity and made Sumangala pull out the arrow. Sumangala was full of remorse, but the Pacceka Buddha died. Feeling sure that the king would never forgive him, Sumangala fled with his wife and children. After a year he asked a friend, a minister at court, to discover how the king felt towards him. The man uttered his praises in the king's presence, but the king remained silent. This was repeated every year, and in the third year, knowing that the king now bore him no ill will, he returned to the king, who, after hearing from him how the accident had happened, forgave him. When asked why he had remained silent, the king replied that it was wrong for a king to act hastily in his anger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sumangala is identified with Ananda.

For seven years and seven days he lay in her womb, and for seven days she was in labour and was unable to bring forth the child.

Some say that after his ordination he left home on the same day and lived in a secluded hut, meditating on the delays in his birth, and thus, winning insight, attained arahantship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Padumuttara Buddha's time he made the resolve to be pre eminent among recipients of gifts, like &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/sudassana')"&gt;Sudassana&lt;/a&gt;, disciple of Padumuttara.

Then he was born in the Nimmánaratí world. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thirty four times he was king of men, under the name of Subáhu (Thag.vs.60; ThagA.i.135).

Both Ud. and J. say that a lay supporter of Moggallána postponed his entertainment of the Buddha (who requested him to do so) to enable the Buddha to accept Suppavásá's invitation after the birth of the child. Other accounts omit this. Ud. says nothing about Sívalí's retirement from the world. The DhA. account of this differs from the others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sívalí was declared by the Buddha (A.i.24) pre-eminent among recipients of gifts. It is said (ThagA.i.138; Ap.ii.495; AA.i.139) that when the Buddha visited &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/r/revata')"&gt;Khadiravaniya-Revata&lt;/a&gt;, he took Sívalí with him because the road was difficult and provisions scarce. Sívalí went to the Himálaya with five hundred others, to test his good luck. The gods provided them with everything. On Gandhamádana a deva, named Nágadatta, entertained them for seven days on milk rice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Sívalí.&lt;/b&gt; Daughter of Amandagámani and sister of Culábhaya.

Sudhamma Thera.&lt;/b&gt; He lived in Macchikásanda, in a monastery (the Ambátakáráma) provided by Citta. Citta used to invite Sudhamma to his house for meals. One day Sáriputta, at the head of several eminent monks, visited Macchikásanda and stayed in the monastery. Citta heard Sáriputta preach (and became a sakadágámin, says DhA), and, at the end of the sermon, invited him and the monks to his house the next day. He also invited Sudhamma, but because he had been invited after the others, Sudhamma refused to go. Early the next day he visited Citta's house to see what offerings had been prepared, and after seeing them, remarked that one thing was missing: sesame cakes (tilasanguliká). Then Citta rebuked him, comparing him to a crow, the offspring of a cock and a crow. Sudhamma left the house in anger, and going to Sávatthi, reported the matter to the Buddha. The Buddha blamed Sudhamma and said that the Sangha should pass the patisáráníyakamma on him. Sudhamma, thereupon, went to Macchikásanda to ask pardon of Citta, but Citta would not forgive him. The Buddha then gave him a companion, and together they went to Citta, and Sudhamma again asked pardon for his fault. Citta pardoned him and asked to be pardoned himself (Vin.i.15-20; cf. </data>

(Anct. Geog. of India, p.569f.; he identifies Sauvíra with Sophir or Ophir; cf. Hopkins, Great Epic, 373, 474.). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The compound Sindhu-Sovíra (E.g., VvA.332) suggests that Sovíra was situated between the Indus and the Jhelum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

One day his pupils went, with his leave, to Benares, to the haunts of men, for salt and vinegar. The king welcomed them, and invited them to stay in the royal park for four months. During this time a drinking festival was held in the city, and the people, thinking to give the hermits a rare gift, entertained them to the best they had. The hermits became drunk and behaved with undue hilarity. When they emerged from their stupor and realized what they had done, they left the city and hastened back to their teacher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related in reference to the occasion on which Ságata Thera (q.v.) got drunk.

Suriya Sutta.&lt;/b&gt; The Buddha explains to the monks the destruction of the world by the gradual appearance of seven consecutive suns. Details are given of the havoc caused by each subsequent sun. The sutta is intended to show that all things are impermanent; but only those who possess Ariyan knowledge realize this. Even so great a teacher as Sunetta (q.v.) could not find the way out of sorrow (A.iv.100f). The sutta was also evidently called Sattasuriya or Sattasuriyuggamana Sutta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3.

He heard Sáriputta preach, entered the Order, and became an arahant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Padumuttara Buddha he was a brahmin, who became an ascetic.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Sutta Nipáta&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the books, generally the fifth, of the Khuddaka Nikáya. It consists of five Vaggas - Uraga, Cúla, Mahá, Atthaka and Páráyana - the first four consisting of fifty four short lyrics, while the fifth contains sixteen suttas. Of the thirty eight poems in the first three cantos, six are found in other books of the canon, showing that they had probably existed separately, as popular poems, before being incorporated in the Sutta Nipáta. The fourth canto is referred to in the Samyutta Nikaya, the Vinaya Pitaka and the Udána, as a separate work, and this canto was probably very closely associated with the last, because the Niddesa is obviously an old Commentary on them and takes no notice of the remaining cantos. (For a detailed account see Law, Páli Literature i.232f.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Díghabhánakas included the Sutta Nipáta in the Abhidhamma Pitaka (DA.i.15).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Commentary exists on the Sutta Nipáta, written by Buddhaghosa, and called the Paramatthajotiká (q.v.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Súkarakhata Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha questions Sáriputta at Súkarakhatalena as to why a monk who has destroyed the ásavas should revere the Buddha and his teachings. Sáriputta answers that it is because such a monk has secured freedom from the yoke. &quot;What kind of security is it?&quot; asks the Buddha, and Sáriputta explains that it is security obtained by the cultivation of the five indriyas of faith, energy, etc. S.v.233f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

It was in the Sunáparanta country and was the birthplace of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pu/punna')"&gt;Punna&lt;/a&gt;. There was regular trade between &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bharukaccha')"&gt;Bhárukaccha&lt;/a&gt;, Suppáraka and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/suvannabhuumi')"&gt;Suvannabhúmi&lt;/a&gt; (See, e.g., Ap.ii.476 (vs.13f.); AA.i.156).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From Suppára to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/saavatthi')"&gt;Sávatthi&lt;/a&gt; was one hundred and twenty leagues (DhA.ii.214; UdA.85), Sávatthi being to the north east of Suppára. UdA.84 (pubbuttaradisábhágáyam). Vijaya and his followers landed there on their way to Ceylon, but had to leave because the people were incensed by their behaviour (Mhv.vi.46; Dpv.ix.15f). &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/ubbarii')"&gt;Ubbarí&lt;/a&gt; was once born in Suppáraka as a horse dealer's daughter (DhA.iv.50).

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Suhemanta Thera&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;He belonged to a rich brahmin family of a border kingdom. One day he heard the Buddha preach in the Deer Park in Sankassa, and, after joining the Order, became a reciter of the Tipitaka, attaining arahantship in due course. He then became a teacher and counsellor of the monks, instructing them and solving their difficulties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Tissa, Buddha he was a forester, and, seeing the Buddha at the foot of a tree, offered him punnága-flowers. Ninety-one kappas ago he was a king, named Tamonuda (Thag.vs.106; ThagA.i.212f). He is evidently identical with Punnágapupphiya of the Apadána. Ap.i.180.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Sulasá. &lt;/b&gt;A nagarasobhiní (courtezan) of Rájagaha. One day she saw the son of Mahádhanasetthi being led to execution for his crimes and, feeling compassion for him because she had once enjoyed his patronage, she sent him four cakes and some drink. Moggallána appeared before him as soon as the cakes were given to him, and the condemned man offered them to the Elder. After death he was born as a devatá on a nigrodha-tree in the park near the city. One day, when Sulasá entered the park, the deity, creating a great darkness, carried her away. Seven days later he took her to Veluvana and left her there on the edge of the crowd who were listening to the Dhamma. When she related her experiences, the people were at first inclined to laugh at her; but her story was verified, and they were amazed. The story was reported to the Buddha, who made it the subject for a sermon. Pv.i.1; PvA.4f. It is probably this story which is repeated at Milinda, p.350, as the &quot;assembly of Sulasá.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Later he killed his father for a reward and was offered the throne of Vanga.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He refused this and founded a city, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/siihapura')"&gt;Síhapura&lt;/a&gt;, in his native country of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/l/laala')"&gt;Lála&lt;/a&gt;, and there lived with Síhasívalí, whom he made his consort.

Subhá.&lt;/b&gt; A group of Brahmás; the group includes the Parittasubhá, the Appamánasubhá and the Subhakinhá. M.iii.102.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Subhá Kammáradhítá.&lt;/b&gt; She was the daughter of a rich goldsmith of Rájagaha. One day she went to pay obeisance to the Buddha and he preached to her. She became a sotápanna, and later she joined the Order under Mahá Pajápatí. From time to time her relations tried to persuade her to leave the Order and return to the world. One day she set forth, in twenty four verses, the dangers of household life and dismissed them, convinced of her rightness. Then, striving for insight, she attained arahantship on the eighth day (Thig.vs.338-61). The Buddha saw this and praised her in three verses (Thig.vs.362-4). Sakka visited her with the gods of Távatimsa and uttered another verse in her praise. ThigA.365; ThigA.236f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Subhá Jívakambavaniká. &lt;/b&gt;She belonged to an eminent brahmin family of Rájagaha, and, seeing the bane in the pleasures of sense, became a nun under Pajápatí Gotamí. She was called Subhá because her body was beautiful. One day, in Jívakambavana, a libertine, in the prime of youth, seeing her going to her siesta, stopped her, inviting her to sensual pleasures. She talked to him of the evils of such pleasures, but he persisted. Seeing that he was particularly enamoured of the beauty of her eyes, she pulled out one of them, saying: &quot;Come, here is the offending eye.&quot; The man was appalled and asked her forgiveness. Subhá went to the Buddha, and, at sight of him, her eye recovered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Filled with joy, she stood worshipping him, and he taught her and gave her an exercise for meditation. She developed insight and became an </data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Sundarasamudda Thera&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was the son of a wealthy setthi of Rájagaha and was called Sundara on account of his beauty. While yet young, he realized the majesty of the Buddha, when he visited Rájagaha, and Samudda entered the Order. He once went to Sávatthi, where he stayed with a friend, learning how to practise insight. On a festival day his mother thought of him and wept, seeing the sons of other families enjoying themselves with their wives. A courtesan offered to entice him back, and the mother promised that should she succeed she would make her Samudda's wife and give her many gifts. The courtesan went, well attended, to Sávatthi and took lodgings in a house to which Samudda frequently came for alms. She saw that he was well seen to and showed herself to him, decked and adorned and wearing golden slippers. One day, slipping off her sandals at the door, she saluted him with clasped hands as he passed, and invited him in with seductive manner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then the Thera, realizing that the heart of a worldling is unsteady, made then and there a supreme effort and attained arahantship (Thag.vss.459-65; ThagA.i.467f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Dhammapada Commentary (DhA.iv.194ff.; cf. the story of Cullapindapátikatissa), Samudda accepted the invitation of the courtesan and went with her to the top floor of her seven storied house. There she provided him with a seat and practised her wiles. Samudda suddenly realized what he was doing and was much distressed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha, seated in Jetavana, forty five leagues away, saw what was happening and smiled. On being asked by Ananda why he smiled, he said: &quot;A battle royal is being waged between Sundarasamudda and a courtesan, but Samudda will win.&quot; So saying, he sent forth a ray of light to Samudda and </data>
<data>preached to him. At the end of the sermon Samudda became an arahant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Sonadanda Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fourth sutta of the Dígha Nikáya. It records the discussion between the Buddha and Sonadanda. The Buddha asks him what things enable a man to make a just claim to be a brahmin and Sonadanda answers him. The Buddha makes him admit that birth is of no importance, only the good life matters. The Buddha then teaches him what is meant by the good life in the Buddha's own doctrine, in very much the same way as in that of the Sámaññaphala Sutta.

In the past he had smeared the Gandhakuti of Kassapa Buddha with costly sandalwood paste and had desired that he might be reborn with a fragrant body: therefore he, on the day of his birth, and his mother, while she carried him, filled the house with fragrance hence his name. When he grew up, he heard Mahásela Thera preach and entered the Order, attaining arahantship in seven days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Tissa Buddha he was a hunter. Tissa Buddha saw him, and, out of compassion for him, left his footprint where the hunter might see it. The hunter recognized the footprint as that of a Great Being and offered to it karandaka flowers (Thag.vs.24; ThagA.i.80f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is probably identical with Karandapupphiya Thera of the Apadána. Ap.ii.434; the same verses occur at Ap.ii.383; cf. ThagA.i.270; i.405, where they are found under Subhúti.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sugandha. A khattiya of thirty one kappas ago, a former birth of Atuma (Gandhodakiya) Thera. ThagA.i.162; Ap.i.158.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Sugandha Thera. &lt;/b&gt;In the past he had been a setthiputta of Benares and had joined the Order under Kassapa Buddha, becoming famous as a preacher. After death he was born in Tusita, and in this life was born among men, with a fragrant body hence his name. He entered the Order and became an arahant. Ap.ii.459-63.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

On the way to his fields he passed a pond and grew friendly with a golden crab living in the pond. A she-crow longed to eat the farmer's eyes, and persuaded her husband to induce a snake to bite the farmer. This he did, and, overcome with the poison, the farmer fell near the pool. Attracted by the noise, the crab emerged, and, seeing the crow about to peck out the farmer's eyes, caught the crow with his claws. When the snake came to the rescue of the crow, the crab fastened on him too. The crab made the snake suck the poison from the farmer's body, and, when he stood up, the crab crushed the necks of both the snake and the crow and killed them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to Ananda’s attempt to save the Buddha from the elephant (Dhanapála) sent by Devadatta to kill him, by standing between the elephant and the Buddha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mára was the serpent, Devadatta the crow, and Ananda, the crab. Ciñcámánaviká was the female crow. J.iii.293-8.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

She is identified with Uppalavanná. J.vi.157.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Selá Therí.&lt;/b&gt; She was born in Alavi as daughter of the king: therefore she was also called Alaviká. When she was still unmarried the Buddha visited Alaví with Alavaka, whom he had converted, carrying his begging bowl and robe. On that occasion Sela went with her father to hear the Buddha preach. She became a lay disciple, but later, agitated in mind, she joined the Order and became an arahant. After that she lived in Sávatthi. One day, as she was enjoying her siesta in the Andhavana under a tree, Mára, in the guise of a stranger, approached her and tried to tempt her. But she refuted his statements regarding the attractions of lay life, and Mára had to retire discomfited (S.i.134; Thig.vss.57-9).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Padumuttara Buddha Selá was born in the family of a clansman of Hamsavatí and was given in marriage. After her husband's death she devoted herself to the quest of good, and went from áráma to áráma and vihára to vihára, teaching the Dhamma to followers of the religion. One day she came to the Bodhi tree of the Buddha and sat down there thinking, &quot;If a Buddha be peerless among men, may this tree show the miracle of Enlightenment.&quot; Immediately the tree blazed forth, the branches appeared golden, and the sky was all shining. Inspired by the sight, she fell down and worshipped the tree, and sat there for seven days. On the seventh day she performed a great feast of offering and worship to the Buddha (ThigA.61f). Her Apadána verses, quoted in the Therígáthá Commentary, are, in the Apadána itself, attributed to a Therí called Pañcadípiká, and are twice repeated in these verses (Ap.ii.519, repeated </data>
<data>at 527f), however, she is mentioned as having attained arahantship at the age of seven, and there is no reference to her life as daughter of the king of Alaví. See also Selá (3).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Selá Therí.&lt;/b&gt; An arahant. In the time of Kassapa Buddha she belonged to a lay disciple's family in Sávatthi. She heard the Buddha preach and learnt the Doctrine. She was born after death in Távatimsa. In her last life she was the daughter of a setthi, and hearing the Buddha preach, she entered the Order and attained arahantship. Ap.ii.614f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

The king entertained them and told them of his worry because he had no sons. Some time later, when the ascetics were returning, Mahá Rakkhita saw that the king would have a son and told his companions so. One of the ascetics, a cheat, hoping to get gain thereby, feigned illness, and, returning to the palace, told the king that a son would be born to his queen, Sudhammá. The king showed him great honour, and he came to be called Dibbacakkhuka. In due course, the Bodhisatta was born as the king's son, and was named Somanassa. When the boy was seven years old the king had to leave home to quell a border rising, and Somanassa was left in the charge of the cheating ascetic. The boy soon discovered his real nature and paid him no honour. As soon as the king returned, Dibbacakkhu complained to him that the prince had ill treated him. Somanassa was ordered to be executed, but he exposed the cheat's knavery, and men, sent to search his hut, found bundles of money in it. Disgusted with life at court, Somanassa obtained the king's leave and became an ascetic in the Himálaya, where Vissakamma, commanded by Sakka, built a hermitage for him. The cheat was stoned to death by the people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related in reference to Devadatta's attempt to kill the Buddha. He is identified with Dibbacakkhu, Sáriputta with Mahárakkhita and Somanassa's mother with Mahámáyá. J.iv.445ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Sigála Játaka (No.113).&lt;/b&gt; The people of Benares once held a sacrifice to the Yakkhas, placing meat and liquor in their courtyards. A jackal, who entered the city through a sewer, regaled himself with food and drink and then went to sleep in some bushes in the city. He did not awake till morning, and then, looking for a way of escape, met a brahmin. Promising to show him a spot where lay hidden two hundred pieces of gold, he persuaded the brahmin to carry him out of the city in his waist cloth. Arrived at the cemetery, he asked the brahmin to spread his robe and dig under a tree. While the brahmin dug, the jackal fouled the robe and ran away. The Bodhisatta, then a tree sprite, advised the brahmin to wash his robe and cease being a fool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to Devadatta, who is identified with the jackal. J.i.424 26.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Sigála Játaka (No.142).&lt;/b&gt; Once, during a festival in Benares, some rogues were drinking and eating till late at night, and when the meat was finished, one of them offered to go to the charnel field and kill a jackal for food. Taking a club, he lay down as though dead. The Bodhisatta, then king of the jackals, came there with his flock, but in order to make sure that it was a corpse, he pulled at the club. The man tightened his grip, and the Bodhisatta mocked at his silliness. The man then threw the club at the jackals, but they escaped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to Devadatta, who is identified with the rogue. J.i.489f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Sigála Játaka (No.148).&lt;/b&gt; The Bodhisatta was once born as a jackal, and, coming across the dead body of an elephant, ate into it from behind and lived inside it. When the body dried up, he became a prisoner </data>
<data>and made frenzied efforts to escape. Then a storm broke, moistening the hide and allowing him to emerge through the head, but not without losing all his hair as he crawled through. He thereupon resolved to renounce greediness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to five hundred companions, rich men of Sávatthi, who joined the Order. One night the Buddha perceived that they were filled with thoughts of lust. He therefore sent Ananda to summon all the monks in the monastery, and told this tale to illustrate the evil effects of desire. The five hundred monks became arahants. J.i.601f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Sigála Játaka (No.152). &lt;/b&gt;The Bodhisatta was once a lion with six brothers and one sister. When the lions were away after food, a jackal who had fallen in love with the lioness told her of his love. She was greatly insulted, and resolved to tell her brothers and then die. The jackal slunk away and hid in a cave. One by one the lions came in, and when their sister told them of the insult, they tried to reach the jackal by leaping upwards, but perished in the attempt. At last came the Bodhisatta; being wise, be roared the lion's roar three times and the jackal died. He then consoled his sister.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told to a barber in Vesáli who served the king's household. His son used to go with him to the palace, and, having fallen in love with a Licchavi girl, died of a broken heart because he could not have her. The barber, who was a pious follower of the Buddha, visited the Buddha some time after and told him of what had happened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The jackal was the barber's son, the lioness the Licchavi girl, and the six young lions the Chabbaggiyá.

When he grew old hits eyes became weak and he was looked after by his son. The son once discovered a special kind of mango on an island, and, having eaten of it himself, brought some home to his parents. The Bodhisatta recognized the mango and warned his son that parrots visiting that island were short lived. But the son took no heed, and one day, while flying back from the island, he fell asleep from weariness and was eaten by a fish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to a monk who died of over eating.

He then thought he must be mad and told everyone so. The Buddha explained that what the man had seen was real; it was an Asura army, fleeing from the devas in panic, through a lotus stalk (S.v.447f.; cf. Rámáyana i.34). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Near the pond was the Moranivápa, and within walking distance was the Paribbájakáráma in Queen Udumbariká's park.

Once a large number of monks assembled there, and when she was asked to help in entertaining them, she abused the monks, calling them &quot;shavelings.&quot; Later she was born as a peta in a village far away. She revealed her identity to an upásaka, who had come from Hatthinipura on business. He reported the matter to her mother, who gave alms in her name, and after that the peta was happy.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Sivi Játaka (No. 499)&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bodhisatta was once born as Sivi, king of Aritthapura, his father bearing the same name as himself. He ruled well, and daily gave alms to the amount of six hundred thousand. One day the desire came to him to give part of his body to any who might ask for it. Sakka read his thoughts, and, appearing before him as a blind brahmin, asked for his eyes. The king agreed to give them, and sent for his surgeon Sivaka. Amid the protests and lamentations of his family and his subjects, Sivi had his eyes removed and given to the brahmin. It is said that the surgeon did his work in several stages, giving Sivi chances of withdrawing his offer. When the sockets healed Sivi wished to become an ascetic, and went into the park with one attendant. Sakka's throne grew hot, and appearing before Sivi, he offered him a boon. The king wished to die, but Sakka insisted on his choosing something else. He then asked that his sight might be restored. Sakka suggested an Act of Truth (sacca-kiriyá), as not even Sakka could restore lost sight. The eyes reappeared, but they were neither natural eyes nor divine, but eyes called &quot;Truth, Absolute and Perfect.&quot; Sivi collected all his subjects, and, resting on a throne in a pavilion, taught them the value of gifts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related in reference to Pasenadi's Asadisadána. On the seventh day of the almsgiving the king gave all kinds of requisites and asked the Buddha to preach a thanksgiving sermon, but the Buddha left without doing so. The next day, on being questioned by the king, he explained his reasons for this (For details see &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/asadisadaana')"&gt;Asadisadána&lt;/a&gt;). The king, greatly pleased with the Buddha's explanation, gave him an outer robe of Siveyyaka cloth worth one thousand. When the monks started commenting on how tireless the king </data>
<data>was in giving, the Buddha related to them the old story, in which Ananda is identified with Sivaka, the physician, and Anuruddha with Sakka (J.iv.401-12; of. CypA.52f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Sivirájacariyá is included in the Cariyápitaka (Cyp.i.8; the story is also given with variant details in the Avadánasataka i.183-6). It forms the topic of one of the dilemmas of the Milinda-Pañha. Mil.p.119f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

The principal royal smith had a beautiful daughter, and the Bodhisatta, wishing to win her, made a delicate needle that could pierce, dice and float on water, and for this needle he made seven sheaths. He then went to the village of the head smith, stood outside his house, and sang the praises of his needle. The smith's daughter, who was fanning her father, spoke to the Bodhisatta and asked him to go elsewhere, as no one in that village would want needles. The Bodhisatta answered that his were no ordinary needles, and the head smith asked him to show them. The Bodhisatta suggested that all the smiths be summoned, and in their presence he gave the needle-tube to the head smith. He thought that it was the needle itself, for he could find no end or tip. The tube was handed back to the Bodhisatta, who took out the first sheath. In this way the seven sheaths were removed, and when the needle was at last revealed he made the needle pierce the anvil and lie on the surface of a vessel of water. The whole assembly was filled with envy and admiration, and the head smith gave his daughter to the Bodhisatta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related in the same circumstances as the Maháummagga Játaka (q.t). The smith's daughter is identified with Ráhulamátá. J.iii.281-6.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

He was the brother of Kuñcanága's queen and was his commander in chief. He rebelled against the king and defeated him; he then reigned in Anurádhapura. He erected a parasol over the Mahá Thúpa, rebuilt the Lohapásáda, and restored the steps leading to the Bodhi tree. His son was Vohárika Tissa.

When Soma said he could not walk home barefoot, nor face his family without his ring, Somadatta returned his winnings and the two became great friends. Somadatta was later sentenced to death for repeated adultery. When Soma discovered this he offered his life instead and was killed. He was reborn as a deva and took Somadatta to the deva world for a week, sending him back with a wish conferring gem. Later Somadatta too was born near Soma.

It was evidently named after the senápati Subha, who built a fortress there in the time of Mágha (Cv.lxxxi.3). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later, it was occupied by Bhuvanekabáhu (brother of Vijayabáhu IV.), and formed the centre of the campaign in the battle of Vijayabáhu IV. against Candabhánu. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later, Bhuvanekabáhu continued to live there (Cv.lxxxviii.26, 61, 64 f., 79). After Vijayabáhu IV. was killed by his senápati Mitta, Bhuvanekabáhu, who had succeeded to the throne at Jambuddoni, had once more to seek refuge in Subhagiri, and for some time it was the seat of government. A town seems to have grown up there in the same way as at Síhagiri (Cv.xc.11, 28, 30, 35).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bhuvanekabáhu himself ruled there for eleven years (Cv.xc.42). After his death, Ariyacakkavatti laid waste the town (Cv.xc.45), and the capital was later moved to Hatthigiri(sela)pura (Cv.xc.59).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Subhagiri is identified with the modern Yápahu, near Maho.

Sumaná.&lt;/b&gt; Wife of Sumana (14) and mother of Nigrodha-sámanera. Mhv.v.41.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;5. Sumaná.&lt;/b&gt; Wife of Sumedha Buddha in his last lay life. Bu.xii.20.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;6. Sumaná.&lt;/b&gt; Called Sumanárájakumárí. She was the daughter of the king of Kosala and sister of Pasenadi. She is included among the eminent upásikás (A.iv.347). She once visited the Buddha, with five hundred royal maidens in five hundred royal chariots, and questioned him regarding the efficacy of giving (See Sumanárájakumárí Sutta, A.iii.32f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commentary explains (AA.ii.593f ) that these five hundred companions were born on the same day as herself. She was seven years old when the Buddha paid his first visit to Sávatthi, and she was present at the dedication of Jetavana with her five hundred companions, carrying vases, flowers, etc., as offering to the Buddha. After the Buddha's sermon she became a sotápanna.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is said that, in the time of Vipassí Buddha, she belonged to a setthi family, her father being dead. When the people, almost at the point of the sword, obtained the king's permission to entertain the Buddha and his monks, it was the senápati's privilege to invite the Buddha to his house on the first day. When Sumaná came back from playing, she found her mother in </data>
<data>tears, and when asked the reason, her mother replied, &quot;If your father had been alive, ours would have been the privilege of entertaining the Buddha today.&quot; Sumaná comforted her by saying that that honour should yet be theirs. She filled a golden bowl with richly flavoured milk rice, covering it with another bowl. She then wrapped both vessels all round with jasmine flowers and left the house with her slaves. On the way to the senápati's house she was stopped by his men, but she coaxed them to let her pass, and, as the Buddha approached, saying that she wished to offer him a jasmine garland, she put the two vessels into his alms bowl. She then made the resolve that in every subsequent birth she should be named Sumaná and that her body should be like a garland of jasmine. When the Buddha arrived in the senápati's house and was served first with soup, he covered his bowl saying that he had already been given his food. At the end of the meal the senápati made enquiries, and, full of admiration for Sumaná's courage, invited her to his house and made her his chief consort. Ever after that she was known as Sumaná, and, wherever she was born, a shower of jasmine flowers fell knee deep on the day of her birth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Therígáthá Commentary (ThigA.22f), Sumaná joined the Order in her old age. She was present when the Buddha preached to Pasenadi, the discourse (S.i.68-70) beginning with, &quot;There are four young creatures, Sire, who may not be disregarded,&quot; and Pasenadi was established in the Refuges and the Precepts. Sumaná wished to leave the world, but put off doing so that she might look after her grandmother as long as she lived.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the grandmother's death, Sumaná went with Pasenadi to the vihára, taking such things as rugs and carpets, which she presented to the Order. The Buddha preached to her and to Pasenadi, and she became an </data>
<data>anágámí. She then sought ordination, and, at the conclusion of the stanzas (Thig.vs.16) preached to her by the Buddha, attained arahantship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;7. Sumaná Therí. &lt;/b&gt;She was a Sákyan maiden, belonging to the harem of the Bodhisatta before his renunciation. She joined the Order under Mahá Pajápatí Gotamí, and, as she sat meditating, the Buddha appeared before her in a ray of glory. She developed insight and became an arahant.

Sumaná.&lt;/b&gt; The name of Ubbirí, when she was born in Bhokkantagáma, as the daughter of Sumana. She married Lakuntaka Atimbara, Dutthagámaní’s minister. Later she joined the Pañcabalaka nuns and became an arahant. See Ubbirí (1).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;12. Sumaná. &lt;/b&gt;An eminent teacher of the Vinaya in Ceylon.

They saw a monk begging for alms, and one gave him a sheaf of indívara-flowers, another a handful of blue lilies, another of lotuses, and the fourth some jasmine blossoms. They were all reborn in Távatimsa, their vimánas adjoining each other.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moggallána saw them and learnt their story, which is recorded in the Vimánavatthu as the story of the &lt;b&gt;Caturitthivimána&lt;/b&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last mentioned of the women, who offered sumana-flowers, was called Sumaná.

Later, another deity took her in a cart to Gulapúvatintini, near Anurádhapura. The king, hearing of her, made her his chief queen. Ras.ii.49f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Sumsumáragiri&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A city in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bhagga')"&gt;Bhagga&lt;/a&gt; country, of which it was probably the capital (See, e.g., Sp.iv.862). The  &lt;span lang="en-us"&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddha')"&gt;Buddha&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt;spent the eighth vassa there (BuA.3). Near the city was the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bhesakalavava')"&gt;Bhesakalávana&lt;/a&gt; where the Buddha stayed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During his visits there he preached the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/anumana_sutta')"&gt;Anumána Sutta&lt;/a&gt; (M.i.95f ) and the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bodhirajakumara_s')"&gt;Bodhirája Sutta&lt;/a&gt; (M.ii.91f). The city was the residence of&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/n/nakulapita')"&gt;Nakulapítá&lt;/a&gt; and his wife, with whom the Buddha had several interviews. (E.g., A.ii.61; iii.295 f; iv.268; S.iii.1; iv.116). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is said that once, when the Buddha was at Sumsumáragiri, he saw with his divine eye &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/maha_moggallana_th')"&gt;Moggallána&lt;/a&gt; at&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kallavaala')"&gt;Kallaválamutta&lt;/a&gt; half asleep, and appeared before him and admonished him (A.iv.85). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On another occasion, he saw &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/anuruddha')"&gt;Anuruddha&lt;/a&gt; in the Veluvana in the Ceti country, pondering over the seven &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahapurisavitakka_s')"&gt;Mahápurisavitakkas&lt;/a&gt;, and appeared before him to encourage him (A.iv.228f). Both incidents show that the Buddha visited Sumsumáragiri quite early in his career, in the first year after the Enlightenment. Moggallána also stayed in Sumsumáragiri, and there &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/maara')"&gt;Mára&lt;/a&gt; is said to have entered his stomach and to have given him trouble (M.i.332f.; cf.

He was the younger brother and the successor of Aggabodhi IX. He had three younger brothers: Mahinda, Kassapa and Udaya. His queen was Sanghá. During his reign the Pandu king invaded Ceylon, and Sena had to retire into the Malaya district. After the army of the Pandu king had plundered a great part of the kingdom, Sena made a treaty with him and re-gained his throne. He adopted the three sons and the three daughters of Kittaggabodhi: Kassapa, Sena and Udaya, and Sanghá, Tissá and Kitti. Among the king's good acts was the construction of a monastery on Aritthapabbata for the Pamsukulikas, and a many storeyed pásáda in Jetavana. He also built the Vírankuráráma, the Pubbáráma, Sangha-sena-parivena, Senaggabodhi-vihára, a refectory in the Mahámettapabbata-vihára, and single cells in the Kappúra  and Uttarálha-parivenas. He completed the Dappulapabbata-  and the Kassaparájaka-viháras. Among Sena's ministers were Bhadda (the senápati), Uttara, Vajira and Rakkhasa. His capital was in Pulatthinagara (Cv.l.1ff). He was also known as Silámegha (Cv.l.43). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;2. Sena&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Son of the Adipáda Kassapa, and therefore nephew of  Sena I. On the death of his father, Sena became king as Sena II. (851-85 A.C.). He married Sanghá, daughter of Kittaggabodhi, and had a son, Kassapa. Sena sent an expeditionary force against the Pandu king, captured Madhurá, and brought back the treasures which had been pillaged by the Pandus in the time of Sena I. The Pamsukulika monks separated from the incumbents of Abhayagiri in the twentieth year of Sena's reign. He built the Manimekhala dam and a dam across the Kanavápi at Katthantanagara. He endowed various monasteries - Buddhagáma, </data>
<data>Mahiyangana, Kútatissa, Mandalagiri, and Sobbha - and held a special ceremony in honour of the image of Ananda. He held a consecration festival at the Hemaváluka-cetiya (Mahá Thúpa), and decreed that this festival should be repeated annually. His senápati was Kutthaka.

Cv.liii.13, 28ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;6. Sena.&lt;/b&gt; Uparája of Udaya IV., and afterwards king of Ceylon (Sena IV. 953-6 A.D.). He was learned, and used to explain the suttantas in the Lohapásáda. Because of his piety, the gods sent timely rain. He made a casket for the Tooth Relic and built the Sitthagáma-parivena. Cv.liii.39; liv.1ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;7. Sena. &lt;/b&gt;Senápati of Mahinda IV. and of Sena V. He was sent to Nágadípa, where he subdued the Vallabha king. Once, when he was absent, Sena V. had the senápati's younger brother, Mahámalla, slain for an offence with the queen mother, and appointed a court official Udaya as senápati. When Sena senápati heard of this, he marched against the king, who had to flee to Rohana. The queen mother joined Sena, and he lived in Pulatthipura. This king, later, dismissed Senápati Udaya and made peace with Sena, whose daughter </data>
<data>he married. Cv.liv.13f.; lviii.70.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;8. Sena. &lt;/b&gt;Son of Mahinda IV. and king of Ceylon (Sena V. 972-81 A.C.). His mother was a Kálinga princess. He came to the throne at the age of twelve. His senápati was also called Sena (see Sena 7), and for some time the king had to live in Rohana from fear of Sena. But later he made peace, and married Sena's daughter and had a son, Kassapa. The king drank much, and died of digestive trouble in the tenth year of his reign. Cv.liv.57-72.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;9. Sena.&lt;/b&gt; Adhikári of Kittisirimegha (2). He was sent to fight against Parakkamabáhu I. at Siriyála and Buddhagáma, but was defeated.

J.i.453.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Sudhammá.&lt;/b&gt; One of the four wives of Magha. When Magha and his companions were building a rest house for travellers, they did not wish women to have any share in the work. But Sudhammá bribed the carpenter, who made a pinnacle of seasoned wood for the building and laid it aside with the words: &quot;Sudhammá náma ayam sálá.&quot; When the time for the erection of the pinnacle came, he told Magha and the others that it was impossible to make a pinnacle then, as it must be of well seasoned wood. A search was started for a seasoned pinnacle. Sudhammá agreed to give hers if she were allowed a share in the building. The men were at first unwilling, but in the end gave their consent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After death, Sudhammá, was born in Távatimsa, and, because of her merit in the past, there came into being for her Sudhammá, the Moot Hall of the Devas, nine hundred leagues in extent (DhA.i.269f., 274f.; J.i.201f). There the Devas hold their meetings on the eighth day of each month, or when the Dhamma is preached, and also all their important festivals and gatherings (See, e.g., D.ii.268; M.ii.79; S.i.221; J.vi.97, 126; Thag.vs.1198). All Buddhas preach the Abhidhamma in the Sudhammá-hall. It is said (ThagA.ii.185) that every devaloka has a Sudhammá-sabhá; this title is often used in comparisons to denote a fine hall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4.

The viceroy therefore left the city with his wife and lived in a hut in a frontier village. When he discovered, by observing the stars, that the king was dead, he returned with his wife to take the throne. On the way they passed a mountain, and his wife asked: &quot;If this mountain were of pure gold, would you give me some of it?&quot; &quot;Not an atom,&quot; he replied, and she was deeply hurt. She became queen, but was shown no respect or honour by the king. The Bodhisatta, noticing this, questioned her and made her promise to repeat her story in the king's presence. This she did, and the king, realizing her affection for him, bestowed all honour on her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told to a landowner of Sávatthi who went with his wife to collect a debt. They received a cart in satisfaction of the debt, and, leaving it with friends, were on the way home when they saw a mountain, and a conversation, identical with the one above, took place. Arrived at Sávatthi, they went to Jetavana, and when the Buddha asked the wife if she were happy, she told him what had happened. The Buddha then related the story of the king and queen who were the landowner and his wife. At the end of the story they became sotápannas. J.iii.66-70.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

He visits the Buddha at Veluvana and tells him that his heart is full of dismay. The Buddha replies that the only path out of sorrow is by way of wisdom, renunciation and restraint (S.i.53). According to the Commentary, (SA.i.88f.; DA.iii.750; MA.i.190f ), he was a devaputta of Távatimsa, and one day went to the Nandana Park with one thousand nymphs. Five hundred of them sat with him under the Páricchattaka-tree, while the others climbed the tree, from which they threw garlands and sang songs. Suddenly all of them vanished and were born in Avíci. Subrahmá, discovering their destiny and investigating his own, finds that he has only seven days more to live. Full of grief, he seeks the Buddha for consolation. At the end of the Buddha's discourse he becomes a sotápanna.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Subrahmá.&lt;/b&gt; A Pacceka Brahmá. He was a follower of the Buddha, and, after visiting him together with Suddhavása, he went on to another Brahmá, who was infatuated with his own importance. There, by a display of magic power, Subrahmá convinced him that he was far more powerful than the Brahmá, but declared that his own power was as nothing compared with that of the Buddha (S.i.146f). On another occasion,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Subrahmá visited the Buddha to declare the folly of Kokálika and of Katamoraka Tissa (S.i.148). Subrahmá was present at the preaching of the Mahásamaya Sutta. D.ii.261.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Subrahmá.&lt;/b&gt; A brahmin who will be the father of Metteyya Buddha. His wife will be Brahmavatí (DhSA.415; Vsm.434). He will be the chaplain of King Sankha (Anágat.vs.96). According to the Mahávamsa (Mhv.xxxii.82) he is identical with Kákavannatissa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

His mother was a passionate woman, harsh and ill tongued, and the Bodhisatta waited for an opportunity of admonishing her. One day, as he accompanied her to the park, a blue jay screeched, and the courtiers stopped their ears, saying: &quot;What a scream! Stop it!&quot; On another day they heard a cuckoo singing and stood listening eagerly. The Bodhisatta pointed this out to his mother and left her to draw her own inference. She understood and reformed herself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related to Anáthapindika's daughter in law, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/sujaataa')"&gt;Sujátá&lt;/a&gt;, who was identified with the queen mother. J.ii.347-51.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Sujáta Játaka (No. 306).&lt;/b&gt; The Bodhisatta was once chaplain to the king of Benares. One day, the king heard a fruiterer's daughter, Sujátá, hawking sweets, and falling in love with her voice he sent for her and made her his queen. Some time later she saw the king eating sweets from a golden dish and asked him what those egg shaped fruits were. The king was very angry; but the Bodhisatta interceded on her behalf and she was pardoned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to a quarrel between &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/mallikaa')"&gt;Malliká&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/pasenadi')"&gt;Pasenadi&lt;/a&gt;, which became famous under the name of Siriviváda or Sayanakalaha. Pasenadi ignored Malliká completely, and the Buddha, knowing this, went to the palace with five hundred monks. The king invited them to a meal, and as the food was being served, the Buddha covered his bowl and asked for Malliká. She was sent for, and the Buddha made peace between them. Malliká is identified </data>
<data>with Sujátá and Pasenadi with the king of Benares. J.iii.20-22.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Sujáta Játaka (No. 352).&lt;/b&gt; The Bodhisatta was once a landowner of Benares, named Sujáta. When his grandfather died his father gave himself up to despair and, having erected a mound over the dead man's bones, spent all his time offering flowers there. Wishing to cure him, Sujáta feigned madness, and, seeing a dead ox outside the city, put grass and water near it and kept on trying to make it eat and drink. News of this was carried to his father, who hurried to the spot. In the course of their conversation Sujáta convinced his father of his folly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told to a lay follower of the Buddha who, after his father's death, gave himself up to grief. The Buddha visited him and told him this story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;J.iii.155-7. The story is given in PvA.39f., but there it is related to the monks and not to the householder; he, however, became a sotápanna.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Suppabuddha.&lt;/b&gt; A &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sakya')"&gt;Sákiyan&lt;/a&gt; prince, son of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/anjana')"&gt;Añjana&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/y/yasodharaa')"&gt;Yasodhará&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He had a brother, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/dandapaanii')"&gt;Dandapáni&lt;/a&gt;, and two sisters, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahamaayaa')"&gt;Máyá&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahapajapati_gotami')"&gt;Pajápatí&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He married &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/am/amitaa')"&gt;Amitá&lt;/a&gt; and had two children, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bhaddakaccaanaa')"&gt;Bhaddakaccáná&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/devadatta')"&gt;Devadatta&lt;/a&gt;. Thus he was father in law to the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddha')"&gt;Buddha&lt;/a&gt; (Mhv.ii.19, 21; but see also Añjana). It is said (DhA.iii.44f.; cf. Mil.301) that he was offended with the Buddha for deserting his daughter and for being hostile to Devadatta. One day he took strong drink and blocked the Buddha's path, refusing to move in spite of the repeated requests of the monks. The Buddha thereupon turned back. Ananda seeing the Buddha smile and enquiring the reason for the smile, was told that, at the end of seven days, Suppabuddha would be swallowed up by the earth at the foot of his stairs. Suppabuddha overheard this, and had all his belongings carried to the seventh storey of his house. He removed the stairway, closed all doors, and set a strong guard. On the seventh day a state charger belonging to Suppabuddha broke loose. None could manage him except Suppabuddha, and he, desiring to seize the animal, moved towards the door. The doors opened of their own accord, the stairway returned to its place, and the strong guard threw him down the stairs. When he landed at the bottom of the stairway the earth opened and swallowed him </data>
<data>up in Avíci. He was also evidently called Mahásuppabuddha. E.g., ThigA.140.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Suppabuddha.&lt;/b&gt; A poor leper of Rájagaha, who, one day seated in the outer circle of people, heard the Buddha preach and became a sotápanna. While waiting the departure of the crowd so that he could pay homage to the Buddha and express his gratitude, Sakka, desiring to test him, approached him and offered him untold wealth if he would repudiate the Buddha, his teachings, and the Order. But although Sakka revealed his identity, Suppabuddha rebuked him for a fool and said he had no need of more wealth, because he possessed already the seven stores of Ariyadhana (Noble Wealth). Sakka reported this conversation to the Buddha, who said that no power in the world would change Suppabuddha. Soon after, Suppabuddha visited the Buddha, and, having worshipped him, was on his way to the city when he was gored to death by a cow, the cow which killed also &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pu/pukkusati')"&gt;Pukkusáti&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/baahiya')"&gt;Báhiya Dáruciriya&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/t/tambadaathika')"&gt;Tambadáthika&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cow was a Yakkhiní, who had once been a courtesan. These four men had then been sons of wealthy merchants, who, having taken her one day to a pleasure garden, took their pleasure with her. In the evening they killed her and took the jewels and money which they themselves had given her. At the moment of her death she had vowed vengeance on them and had killed them in one hundred existences.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a previous birth, Suppabuddha had insulted the Pacceka Buddha Tagarasikhí by calling him a &quot;leper&quot; (kutthi) - because he wore a patched robe - and by spitting on him. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ud.v.3; UdA.279ff.; DhA.ii.33f.

His eyes were injured by the salt water and he went completely blind. The king appointed him valuer and assessor. One day an elephant was brought before him which was designed to be the state elephant, but, feeling it over with his hands, he condemned it, saying that its dam had dropped it in its youth, injuring its hind feet. He similarly condemned a horse, a chariot, and a blanket for various reasons, all these things having been designed for royal use. All his judgments were verified by the king and found to be correct; but he only gave Suppáraka eight pieces of money each time, and so Suppáraka left his service in disgust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some merchants had commissioned a ship, and, while searching for a captain, thought of Suppáraka. When Suppáraka refused, saying that he was blind, they replied that blind he might be, but no ship could founder if he were at the helm.

Susíma Játaka (No. 163).&lt;/b&gt; Susíma was king of Benares, and the Bodhisatta was his chaplain's son. The chaplain had been master of ceremonies in the king's elephant festival, and, as a result, had amassed great wealth. He died when his son was sixteen. Soon after, another elephant festival came round, and other brahmins obtained the king's consent to be in charge of the ceremonies on the plea that the chaplain's son was too young. When but four days remained before the festival, the Bodhisatta found his mother weeping. She explained that for seven successive generations their family had managed the elephant festival and that she felt the change deeply. The Bodhisatta discovered that a teacher expert in elephant lore lived in &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/t/takkasilaa')"&gt;Takkasilá&lt;/a&gt;, two thousand yojanas away. He comforted his mother and proceeded to Takkasilá, reaching it in a single day. There he paid his fee of one thousand pieces to the teacher and explained the urgency of his mission. In one night the teacher taught him the three Vedas and the elephant lore, and the pupil could even excel his teacher in knowledge. The next morning he left early for Benares and reached it in one day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the day of the festival the Bodhisatta went in all his array before the king, and protested against the alienation of his rights. He challenged anyone to show his superiority over him in elephant lore, and nobody could be found to do so. The king then appointed him to conduct the ceremonies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related in reference to an attempt on the part of the heretics to prevent the people of Sávatthi from giving alms to the Buddha. All the people of the city made a collection to hold an almsgiving, but </data>
<data>they were divided in their allegiance, some wishing to entertain the Buddha, others favouring heretical teachers. A vote was passed, and the majority were found to be in favour of the Buddha. For a whole week alms were given on a lavish scale, and, at the end of the week, the Buddha pronounced a benediction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/aa/aananda')"&gt;Ananda&lt;/a&gt; is identified with Susíma, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/saariputta')"&gt;Sáriputta&lt;/a&gt; with the teacher, Mahámáyá with the Bodhisatta's mother, and Suddhodana with his father. J.ii.45-50.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Susíma Játaka (No. 411).&lt;/b&gt; The Bodhisatta was born as son of the chaplain of the king of Benares and was called &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/susiima')"&gt;Susíma&lt;/a&gt;.

Later Brahmadatta became king and Susíma his chaplain. One day, when Susíma was taking part in a procession with the king, the queen mother saw him and fell desperately in love with him. The king, discovering this, made Susíma king in his place and the queen mother Susíma's queen. But Susíma soon tired of royalty, and after establishing Brahmadatta once more on the throne, returned to the Himálaya in spite of his wife's protests. There he became an ascetic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to the Buddha's Renunciation. &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/aa/aananda')"&gt;Ananda&lt;/a&gt; is identified with Brahmadatta and the queen mother with &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/r/rahulamata')"&gt;Ráhulamátá&lt;/a&gt;.

One day the lion, having eaten some game, went to the lake to drink; but after he had drunk, seeing a boar which he did not wish to frighten away, having the idea of eating it when food should be scarce, he slunk away. The boar saw this, and, thinking that the lion was afraid of him, challenged him to a fight. The lion agreed to fight a week later. The boar was overjoyed, and told his relations of this. But they all frightened him and advised him to spend the next seven days rolling in the hermits' dunghill. When the dirt was dry, he was to moisten his body with dew and go to the meeting place early, standing well to windward. This he did, and when the lion arrived and smelt the filth, the boar was allowed to go away uninjured.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to an old and foolish monk. One night the Buddha returned to his cell late at night after preaching. Then Moggallána asked Sáriputta various questions, which the latter explained. The people stayed on, entranced with Sáriputta's expositions. An old monk, wishing to attract attention to himself, stood up and asked a foolish question. Sáriputta, reading his thoughts, rose from his seat and walked away; so did Moggallána. The laymen who were present were annoyed with the old monk and chased him away. As he ran he fell into a cesspit and was covered with filth. The laymen then felt remorse and visited the Buddha to ask his forgiveness. The old monk is identified with the boar. J.ii.9-12; cf. DhA.iii.344f.; it is said that the story was told concerning &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/l/laludayi_th')"&gt;Láludáyí&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Nágadípa was then known as Seruma, and the Bodhisatta was a young Garuda living there. He used to go in disguise to Benares and play at dice with Tamba. The queen heard of his beauty and contrived to see him, and they fell in love with each other. The Garuda, by his power, raised a storm in the city and covered it with darkness, under cover of which he carried off Sussondí. The king was filled with grief, not knowing what had happened to his queen, as the Garuda continued to play at dice with him. Tamba therefore sent Sagga, a minstrel, to search for her. In the course of his wanderings, Sagga came to Bhárukaccha and took ship for Suvannabhúmi. In the middle of the ocean the sailors asked Sagga to play for them, but Sagga told them that his music would excite the big fish and trouble would ensue. The sailors, however, insisting, Sagga played, and the fish, maddened by the sound, splashed about, and the ship broke in two under the leap of a sea-monster. Sagga lay on a plank, which drifted to Nágadípa. There he saw and was recognized by Sussondí. Sussondí took him home, and, keeping him hidden from the Garuda, enjoyed herself with him when the Garuda was away playing at dice. Six weeks later a ship, with merchants for Benares, touched at Nágadípa, and Sagga returned home. He found Tamba playing at dice with the Garuda and recounted his adventures in song. The Garuda heard the song and understood the references. Filled with remorse that he had not been able to keep his wife, he brought her back to Tamba.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related in reference to a love sick monk. Ananda is identified with Tamba. J.iii.187-90.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

He saw a man sleeping,  and thought to himself that the man must be a thief. The man conceived a grudge against Sumangala, and burned his fields seven times, cut the feet off the cattle in his pen seven times, and burned his house seven times. Then knowing that Sumangala loved the Buddha's Gandhakuti, he also set fire to that. It was burnt down by the time Sumangala could arrive there; seeing it, he clasped his hands, saying that now he could build another in its place. Then the thief went about with a knife concealed on him, waiting to kill Sumangala. One day Sumangala held a great almsgiving, at the conclusion of which he said: &quot;Sir, there is evidently an enemy of mine trying to do me harm. I have no anger against him, and will give over to him the fruits of this offering.&quot; The thief heard and was filled with remorse, and begged his forgiveness.

One day he saw Pasenadi hold a great almsgiving to the Order, and, seeing the food served to the monks, desired to enter the Order that he might lead a life of ease and luxury. A Thera to whom he confessed his desire ordained him, and sent him to the forest with an exercise for meditation. In solitude he pined and wavered, and finally returned to his village. As he went along he saw men working in the fields in the hot wind, with soiled garments, covered with dust. And thinking how miserable they were, he put forth fresh effort in his meditations, and, winning insight, attained arahantship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past he saw Siddhattha Buddha (? Atthadassí Buddha) standing in one robe, after a bath. Pleased with this sight, he clapped his hands. One hundred and sixteen kappas ago he was twice king, under the name of Ekacintita.

The king had a wild horse called Mahásona. The king was miserly, and one day, when some horse dealers brought horses for sale, he gave orders, unknown to his minister, that Mahásona should be let loose among these horses, and that when he had bitten and weakened them, they should be bought at reduced price. The dealers complained to the minister. After inquiring into the matter, he advised them to bring Suhanu, a very strong horse they had, the next time they visited Benares. This they did, and when Mahásona and Suhanu were confronted with each other they showed great affection, and started licking each other. The king saw this, and was told by his minister that the horses recognized each other's virtues. He then warned the king against excessive covetousness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to two hot headed monks, both passionate and cruel. One lived in Jetavana and the other in the country. One day the country monk came to Jetavana, and the monks eagerly awaited their quarrel. But when the two monks met they showed great affection. The Buddha explained that this was because of their like nature. J.ii.30-32.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

The Buddha replies that whether they be born in the deva world or in the world of men, the giver would be superior in life span, beauty, happiness, honour and power. There would still be a difference between them, even when, in later life, they both enter the Order, but the difference would cease to exist on their becoming arahants (A.iii.32f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commentary adds (AA.ii.595f ) that Sumaná's questions were the result of a conversation between two babies born in the house of the King of Kosala, one as the king's son, the other as the son of one of the attendant women. The children were laid side by side on two beds, the prince's bed being higher and better. They had both been monks in their previous life; the prince was a sáráníyadhammapúraka, the other a bhattaggapúraka. The prince saw his past life, and, realizing that the other had not taken his advice and had, therefore, suffered eclipse, addressed him as he lay on the next bed. Sumaná heard their talk, but spoke no word of it to anyone, in case the children should be thought to be possessed of evil spirits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Dissatisfied with them and seeing the happiness enjoyed by Upatissa, Kolita, Sela and others, after they had joined the Order, he too became a monk under the Buddha, winning the favour of his teachers. He went into solitude with an exercise for meditation, and soon afterwards attained arahantship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Kassapa Buddha he belonged to a very rich family of Benares, and, after hearing the Buddha preach, rubbed the Buddha's Gandhakuti eight times a month with the four kinds of perfumes. As a result of this, he was born, in all his births, with a fragrant body (Thag.vss.320-4; ThagA.i.405f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is probably identical with Cúlasugandha of the Apadána.

When her father joined the Order at Mithilá and sent his charioteer home, Sundarí, with her mother's consent, gave all away and joined the Order, attaining arahantship in due course. Then one day, with the leave of her teacher, she left Benares, accompanied by a large number of nuns, and, visiting the Buddha at Sávatthi, uttered her &quot;lion's roar.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thirty one kappas ago she was born in a clansman's family, and seeing Vessabhu Buddha begging for alms, gave him a ladleful of food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fifty times she became the wife of Cakkavattis.

She listened to the persuasions of her colleagues, the heretics, and would be seen in the evenings going towards Jetavana with garlands, perfumes, fruits, etc. When asked where she was going, she would reply that she was going to spend the night in the Buddha's cell. She would then spend it in a neighbouring monastery of the Paribbájakas and be seen again early in the morning coming from the direction of Jetavana. After some days, the heretics hired some villains to kill Sundarí and hide her body under a heap of rubbish near Jetavana. Then they raised a hue and cry and reported to the king that Sundarí was missing. A search was made, and her body was found near the Gandhakuti of the Buddha. Placing the body on a litter, they went about the streets of the city crying: &quot;Behold the deeds of the </data>
<data>Sákyan monks!&quot; As a result, the monks were subjected to great insults in the streets. For seven days the Buddha stayed in the Gandhakuti, not going to the city for alms, and Ananda even suggested that they should go to another city. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the Buddha pointed out to him the absurdity of running away from a false report, and said that in seven days the truth would be known. The king employed spies, who found the murderers quarrelling among themselves after strong drink. They were seized and brought before the king, where they confessed their crime. The king sent for the heretics and compelled them to retract their accusations against the Buddha and his monks and to confess their own wickedness. They were then punished for murder. Ud.iv.8; UdA.256ff.; DhA.iii.474f.; SNA.ii.528f.; J.ii.415f&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is said (Ap.i.299; UdA.263) that once the Bodhisatta was a pleasure seeker named Munáli. One day he saw Surabhi, a Pacceka Buddha, putting on his outer robe just outside the city. Near by a woman was walking, and Munáli said in jest, &quot;Look, this recluse is no celibate, but a rake.&quot; It was this utterance of the Bodhisatta that brought to the Buddha, as retribution, the disgrace in connection with Sundarí.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/dutthatthaka')"&gt;Dutthaka Sutta&lt;/a&gt; and the&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/manisukara_jat_285')"&gt;Manisúkara Játaka&lt;/a&gt; were preached in this connection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4.

Once, when the Buddha was at the Tankitamañca in Gayá, which was the abode of Suciloma, Suciloma and his friend, Khara, happened to be passing by, and Suciloma, coming up to the Buddha, bent his body against the Buddha's. The Buddha bent his body in the opposite direction, saying that contact with him was an evil thing. Then Suciloma asked him a question regarding the origin of various persuasions, and the Buddha answered him (Ap.ii.434; the same verses occur).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is said that Suciloma was a lay follower of Kassapa Buddha and used to visit the vihára eight times a month to hear the Dhamma. (SNA.i.302, 305; in the Samyutta Commentary (SA.i.233) he is said to have been a monk). One day, when he heard the gong announcing the preaching, he was working in a field near the vihára, and thinking he would be late if he stayed to wash, he entered the uposatha hall, where he lay on a very costly rug. As a result of this action, the hairs of his body resembled needles hence his name. At the end of the Buddha's sermon Suciloma became a sotápanna.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An expressive statue of Suciloma is to be found among the bas-reliefs of the Bhárhút Stúpa.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Suvannabhúmi&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A country. At the end of the Third Council, the theras Sona and Uttara visited this country in order to convert it to Buddhism. At that time a female deity of the sea was in the habit of eating every heir born to the king. The arrival of the theras coincided with the birth of a prince. At first the people thought that the monks were the friends of the demon, but later the monks, being told the story, drove away the demon by their iddhi power and erected a bulwark round the country by reciting the Brahmajála Sutta. Sixty thousand people embraced the new faith, while three thousand five hundred young men and fifteen hundred girls of noble family entered the Order. Thenceforth all princes born into the royal family were called Sonuttara (Mhv.xii.6, 44f.; Dpv.viii.12; Sp.i.64).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There seems to have been regular trade between Bharukaccha and Suvannabhúmi (See, e.g., J.iii.188), and also between the latter and Benares (Molini), (J.iv.15), Mithilá (J.vi.34), Sávatthi (PvA.47), and Pátaliputta (PvA.271).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The distance between Ceylon and Suvannabhúmi was seven hundred leagues, and, with a favourable wind, could be covered in seven days and nights (AA.i.265).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suvannabhúmi is generally identified with Lower Burma, probably the Pagan and Moulmein districts. It probably included the coast from Rangoon to Singapore. The chief place in Suvannabhúmi was Sudhammanagara -  i.e., Thaton - at the mouth of the Sittaung River (See Sás. Introd., p.4, and n.3). Fleet suggests (J.R.A.S.1910, p.428), however, that it might be the district in Bengal called by Hiouen Thsang &quot;Ka-lo-na-su-fa-la-na&quot; (Karnasuvarna), or else the country along the river Son in Central India, a tributary of the Ganges, on the right bank of the river which is also called Hiranyaváha.

One day, meeting a Candála, Setaketu told him to pass on his leeward side, but the Candála refused, challenging Setaketu to answer a question. Setaketu accepted the challenge, and he was asked what were the four &quot;quarters.&quot; Setaketu gave the usual answer, whereupon the Candála forced him between his feet. When this was reported to the teacher, he told Setaketu that the four quarters were parents, teachers, generous householders, and deliverance from misery. Later, Setaketu left for Takkasilá, and, after finishing his studies there, went to Benares with five hundred ascetics. There they practised false penances and won the king's approval; the king's chaplain, however, warned him against them, saying that they possessed only false knowledge and had no morality. The chaplain persuaded Setaketu and his followers to become laymen and enter the king's service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related in the same circumstances as the Uddála Játaka (q.v.). Setaketu is identified with the false priest, the Candála with Sáriputta, and the king's chaplain with the Bodhisatta. J.iii.232-7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

When she grew up, she saw the Buddha on his first visit to Rájagaha and became a lay disciple. Later she joined the Order, developed insight, and became an arahant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One day, as she was spending her siesta at the foot of a tree in Andhavana, Mára, wishing to interrupt her privacy, approached her, invisible in the air, and teased her, remarking on the &quot;two finger&quot; consciousness of women. (The Commentary explains that women, when boiling rice, cannot tell if it is cooked without testing it between two fingers, hence the expression). Somá rebuked him, saying that the fact of being a woman was no obstacle to the comprehension of the Dhamma. (This incident is given also at S.i.129).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Sikhí Buddha Somá was born into the family of an eminent nobleman and became the chief consort of King Arunavá. (Thig.vs.60-62; ThigA.66f). The rest of her story is identical with that of Abhayá Therí (q.v.). She is evidently identical with Uppaladáyiká of the Apadána.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Sunakkhatta&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Licchavi prince of Vesáli. He was, at one time, a member of the Order and the personal attendant of the Buddha (anibaddhaupattháka), but was later converted to the views of Korakkhattiya and went about defaming the Buddha, saying that he had nothing superhuman and was not distinguished from other men by preaching a saving faith: that the doctrine preached by him did not lead to the destruction of sorrow, etc. Sáriputta, on his alms rounds in Vesáli, heard all this and reported it to the Buddha, who thereupon preached the Mahásíhanáda Sutta (M.i.68ff.; the Buddha was, at this time, eighty years old, M.i.82) and the Lomahamsa Játaka (J.i.389f.; see also J.iv.95). The Sunakkhatta Sutta (M.ii.252ff) was evidently preached to Sunakkhatta before he joined the Order, while the Pátika Sutta (D.iii.1ff) gives an account of his dissatisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His grievance was that the Buddha showed no mystic superhuman wonders, that he had not shown him the beginning of things. The Buddha reminded him that he had not promised to do any of these things, and that, at one time, Sunakkhatta had been loud in his praise of the Buddha and the Dhamma. The Buddha warned him that people would say he had left the Order because its discipline had proved too hard for him. The Buddha had told him that Korakkhattiya, whom he so much admired, would be born after death among the Kálakañjaka Asuras within seven days. It happened as the Buddha prophesied, and the dead body of Kora declared that he was right. But even so, Sunakkhatta was not convinced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later he transferred his allegiance to Kandaramasaka, who died, as the Buddha had prophesied, fallen from grace and fame. The next teacher to win the admiration of Sunakkhatta was Pátikaputta, and Sunakkhatta wished the </data>
<data>Buddha to pay honour to him. But the Buddha quoted to Sunakkhatta the words of Ajita, the Licchavi general who had been born in Távatimsa, to the effect that Pátikaputta was &quot;a liar and a cheat,&quot; and was later able to prove that these words were true. But Sunakkhatta did not return to the Order. He had probably remained in it for several years before actually leaving it. For we find in the Maháli Sutta (D.i.152) the Licchavi Otthaddha relating to the Buddha how Sunakkhatta had come to him three years after joining the Order, claiming that he could see divine forms but could not hear heavenly sounds. Buddhaghosa explains (DA.i.311) that he could not acquire the power of hearing divine sounds because in a previous birth he had ruptured the ear drum of a holy monk and made him deaf. The Sutta itself gives (D.i.153) as the reason that he had only developed one sided concentration of mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sunakkhatta is identified with Kánáritha of the Bhúridatta Játaka.

He saw the Buddha subdue the elephant, Dhanapála, and, much impressed, entered the Order, becoming an arahant in due course. One day, rising from his seat to recite the Pátimokkha, he took a painted fan (Cf. Khujjuttará, DhA.i.209) and, reseating himself, he spoke eight verses in admonition of the monks and by way of confessing his aññá. Thag.vss.502-9; ThagA.i.488f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

When her sisters, Mahásubhaddá and Cullasubhaddá, married and went to live with their husbands, Anáthapindika appointed her to look after the feeding of the monks in his house. She became a sakadágámi and remained unmarried. Because of her failure to obtain a husband, she refused to eat, and fell ill. One day, when Anáthapindika was in the refectory, he received a message from her. He went immediately and asked her what was the matter. She addressed him as &quot;Younger brother,&quot; and saying that she had no fear, she died. Anáthapindika, in great sorrow, sought the Buddha and confessed his grief that she should have died while talking incoherently. The Buddha explained that, inasmuch as she was a sakadágámí and he but a sotápanna, her addressing him as &quot;Younger brother&quot; was quite in order. After death she was born in Tusita, said the Buddha. DhA.i.151f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;5. Sumanadeví.&lt;/b&gt; Mother of Visákhá.

Sirimá Thera. &lt;/b&gt;He was born in the family of a householder of Sávatthi and was called Sirimá on account of the unfailing success of his family. His younger brother was Sirivaddha. They were both present when the Buddha accepted Jetavana, and, struck by his majesty, they entered the Order. Sirivaddha, though possessed of no special attainments, received great honour from the laity and recluses, but Sirimá was little honoured. Nevertheless, exercising calm and insight, he soon won arahantship. Ordinary monks and novices continued to disparage him, and the Thera had to blame them for their faulty judgment. Sirivaddha, agitated by this, himself became an arahant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Padumuttara Buddha, before the Buddha's appearance in the world, Sirimá was an ascetic, named Devala, with a large following, and, having learnt the power of the Buddha through a study of the science of prognostication, he built a sand thúpa, to which he paid homage in the name of past Buddhas. The Buddha was born in the world, his birth being accompanied by various omens. The ascetic showed these to his pupils, and, having made them eager to see the Buddha, died, and was reborn in the Brahma world. Later, he appeared before them, inspiring them to greater exertions (Thag.vss. 159-60; ThagA.i.279f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is evidently identical with Pulinuppádaka Thera of the Apadána.

Sirimá.&lt;/b&gt; One of the palaces occupied by Mangala Buddha in his last lay life. BuA.116.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;12. Sirimá.&lt;/b&gt; A courtesan of Rájagaha and younger sister of Jívaka. She was once employed by Uttará (Nandamátá) to take her place with her husband (Sumana) while Uttará herself went away in order to indulge in acts of piety. During this time Sirimá tried to injure Uttará, on account of a misunderstanding, but on realizing her error, she begged forgiveness both of Uttará, and, at the latter's suggestion, of the Buddha. (The details of this incident are given Uttará Nandamátá.) At the conclusion of a sermon preached by the Buddha in Uttará's house, Sirimá became a sotápanna. From that day onwards she gave alms daily to eight monks in her house.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A monk in a monastery, three leagues away, having heard of the excellence of Sirimá's alms and of her extraordinary beauty from a visiting monk, decided to go and see her. Having obtained a ticket for alms, he went to her house, but Sirimá was ill, and her attendants looked after the monks. When </data>
<data>the meal had been served she was brought into the dining hall to pay her respects to the monks. The lustful monk at once fell in love with her and was unable to eat. That same day Sirimá died. The Buddha gave instructions that her body should not be burnt, but laid in the charnel ground, protected from birds and beasts. When putrefaction had set in, the king proclaimed that all citizens, on penalty of a fine, should gaze on Sirimá's body. The Buddha, too, went with the monks, the lustful monk accompanying them. The Buddha made the king proclaim, with beating of the drum, that anyone who would pay a thousand could have Sirimá's body. There was no response. The price was gradually lowered to one eighth of a penny. Yet no one came forward, even when the body was offered for nothing. The Buddha addressed the monks, pointing out how even those who would have paid one thousand to spend a single night with Sirimá would not now take her as a gift. Such was the passing nature of beauty. The lustful monk became a sotápanna (DhA.iii.104f.; VvA.74ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buddhaghosa says (SNA.i.244f, 253f ) that Sirimá was Sálavati's daughter, and succeeded to her mother's position as courtezan. After death, Sirimá was born in the Yáma world as the wife of Suyáma. When the Buddha was speaking to the monks at her cremation, she visited the spot with five hundred chariots. Janapadakalyání Nandá, who at that time was also a nun, was present, and when the Buddha preached the Káyavicchandanika Sutta (q.v.) she became an arahant, while Sirimá became an anágámí.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Vimánavatthu (pp.78f., 86) gives the same story, adding that Vangísa was also present at the preaching of the sermon, and, having obtained the Buddha's permission, questioned Sirimá and made her reveal her identity. Here Sirimá is said to have been born in the Nimmánarati-world, and no </data>

He had a son also called Suruci-kumára, who studied at &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/t/takkasilaa')"&gt;Takkasilá&lt;/a&gt;, where Prince Brahmadatta of Benares was his fellow student. They became great friends, and agreed to bring about an alliance between the two royal houses. Suruci came to the throne of Mithilá and had a son called after himself. Brahmadatta became king of Benares and had a daughter, Sumedhá. A marriage was arranged between Suruci and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/sumedhaa')"&gt;Sumedhá&lt;/a&gt;, but Brahmadatta agreed to the alliance only on condition that Sumedhá should be Suruci's only wife. Suruci accepted this condition, but, though Sumedhá lived in the palace for ten thousand years, she had no child. The people clamoured for an heir, but Suruci refused to take another queen, though Sumedhá herself obtained for him many thousands of women for his harem, sixteen thousand in all. Forty thousand years thus passed, but no child was born in the palace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then Sumedhá vowed an Act of Truth; &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sakka')"&gt;Sakka's&lt;/a&gt; throne was heated, and he asked the god &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/n/nalakara')"&gt;Nalakára&lt;/a&gt; to be born as Sumedhá's son. Nalakára reluctantly agreed. Then Sakka went to the king's park disguised as a sage and offered to give any woman who was virtuous a son. &quot;If thou seek virtue, seek Sumedhá,&quot; they said. He then went to the palace, and having made Sumedhá declare to him her virtue, he revealed his identity and promised her a son. In due course a son was born - &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahapanaada')"&gt;Mahápanáda&lt;/a&gt;. He grew up amid great splendour, and, when he was sixteen, the king built for him a grand palace.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
<data>&lt;p&gt;It is said that Sakka sent &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/vissakamma')"&gt;Vissakamma&lt;/a&gt; as mason to help with the building. When the palace was completed, three ceremonies were held on the same day: the dedication of the palace, Mahápanáda's coronation and his marriage. The festival lasted for seven years, and the people began to grumble; but the king would not bring the festival to an end, for all this time Mahápanáda had not once laughed, and the king said the feast could not end till he was made to laugh. Various people came to amuse him, among them two jugglers, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bhandukanna')"&gt;Bhandukanna&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/pandu')"&gt;Pandukanna&lt;/a&gt;; but it was not till &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sakka')"&gt;Sakka&lt;/a&gt; sent a divine dancer to dance the &quot;Half  body&quot; dance, in which one half of the body danced while the rest stood still, that Mahápanáda smiled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related on the occasion on which the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddha')"&gt;Buddha&lt;/a&gt; gave &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/visaakhaa')"&gt;Visákhá&lt;/a&gt; eight boons. One night there was a great storm, and the Buddha asked the monks to drench themselves in the rain as that would be the last great rain storm in his time. Together with them the Buddha appeared at Visákhá's house, but as soon as they arrived on the threshold they were quite dry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bhaddaji is identified with Mahápanáda, Visákhá with Sumedhá, Ananda with Vissakamma, and the Bodhisatta, was Sakka.

Sudinna Kalandakaputta.&lt;/b&gt; A monk who, after being ordained, returned to his former wife and had relations with her, thus becoming guilty of the first Párájiká offence. When there was a famine in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/va/vajjii')"&gt;Vajji&lt;/a&gt; country, Sudinna went to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/vesaali')"&gt;Vesáli&lt;/a&gt;, hoping to be kept by his rich relations, to the mutual benefit of both parties. They gave him sixty bowls of rice, which he distributed among his colleagues. When he went to his father's house, in Kalandakagáma, he saw a servant girl about to throw away some boiled rice and asked her to put it into his bowl. The girl, recognizing his hands and feet and voice, told his mother of his arrival. Both she and his father visited him as he was eating the rice, and his father took him by the hand and led him home. There he was provided with a seat and asked to eat: but he refused, saying he had already eaten. The next day he was again invited; he went, and they tried to tempt him back to the lay life. His former wife joined in the attempt, but on being addressed by him as &quot;Sister,&quot; she fell fainting. Then he begged for his meal, saying that if they desired to give it to him they should do so without worrying him. Later his wife visited him, with his mother, at the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahavana')"&gt;Mahávana&lt;/a&gt;, and begged that he would give her a son, so that the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/l/licchavi')"&gt;Licchavis&lt;/a&gt; might not confiscate their wealth for want of an heir. Sudinna agreed, and had intercourse three </data>
<data>times with her. She became pregnant, and in due course a son was born, who was called &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bijaka')"&gt;Bíjaka&lt;/a&gt;. When Sudinna realized what he had done he was filled with remorse, and his colleagues, discovering the reason, reported him to the Buddha, who blamed him greatly. (Vin.iii.11-21; see Sp.i.270, where Sudinna is held not guilty of the Párájiká offence because he was an ádikammika.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha's censure of Sudinna forms the topic of one of the dilemmas of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/me_mu/milindapanha')"&gt;Milinda-Pañha&lt;/a&gt;. (p.170f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Sudinna. &lt;/b&gt;Evidently a famous commentator. Buddhaghosa quotes (DA.ii.566; AA.ii.551) him as saying that there is no word of the Buddha which is not a sutta (asuttam náma kim buddhavacanam atthi ?) and thus rejecting the Játaka, Patisambhidá, Niddesa, Sutta Nipáta, Dhammapada, Itivuttaka, Vimánavatthu, Petavatthu, Thera  and Therí-gáthá and Apadána.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Subhúti answers that he is the son of a believing disciple and has gone forth from a believer's home to homelessness. The Buddha then asks Subhúti if his colleague conforms to the traditional signs of the believer. Subhúti begs of the Buddha to define these signs, and the Buddha explains them at length. A.v.337f.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Sílavá Thera&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was the son of Bimbisára (Thag.vss.608-19). His brother, Ajátasattu, wished to kill him, but failed, owing to Sílavá's destiny. The Buddha, discerning all this, sent Moggallána to fetch Sílavá. The prince, seeing the Elder, descended from his elephant and did obeisance to the Buddha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha preached to him, and he entered the Order, becoming an arahant. He lived in Kosala. Ajátasattu sent men to kill him; but Sílavá taught them and converted them, and they, too, entered the Order. ThagA.i.536f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

One of the Damila chiefs captured her and took her to India. Later, when Vattagámani recovered his kingdom, he sent for Somadeví, and raising her once more to her former rank, built in her name the Somáráma (Manisomáráma).

Sigálaka Sutta.&lt;/b&gt; An old jackal, afflicted by mange, finds no pleasure in lonely places, or in the woods, or in the open air. Wherever he goes he falls into misfortune and disaster. Even so is a monk whose heart is possessed by gains, favours, or flattery. S.ii.230.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Sigálaka Sutta. &lt;/b&gt;Some old jackals, afflicted with mange, can go wherever they like. There are some Sákyan monks who cannot get even so much release. S.ii.127; the Commentary (SA.ii.169) says that the sutta was preached in reference to Devadatta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Sigálaka Sutta.&lt;/b&gt;-Some Sákyan monks have not as much gratitude as a jackal (S.ii.272). The Commentary adds (SA.ii.170) that the sutta was preached in reference to Devadatta, and the story was about a jackal who was released by a peasant from a snake who had coiled round it. The snake attacked the peasant, and the jackal brought the peasant his axe in its mouth, enabling the man to kill the snake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Takkasilá&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The capital of Gandhára. It is frequently mentioned as a centre of education, especially in the Játakas. It is significant that it is never mentioned in the suttas, though, according to numerous Játaka stories, it was a great centre of learning from pre-Buddhistic times. The Commentaries mention that in the Buddha's day, also, princes and other eminent men received their training at Takkasilá. Pasenadi, king of Kosala, Maháli, chief of the Licchavis, and Bandhula, prince of the Mallas, were classmates in the university of Takkasilá (DhA.i.337). Among others described as being students of Takkasilá are Jívaka, Angulimála, Dhammapála of Avanti, Kanhadinna, Bháradvája and Yasadatta (q.v.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From Benares to Takkasilá was a distance of two thousand yojanas (J.i.395), though we are told that sometimes the journey was accomplished in one day (J.ii.47). The road passed through thick jungle infested by robbers (DhA.iv.66). Takkasilá was, however, a great centre of trade; people flocked to it from various parts of the country (MNid.i.154), not only from Benares, but also from Sávatthi, from which city the road lay through Soreyya (DhA.i.326). In ancient times students came to the university from Lála (J.i.447), from the Kuru country (DhA.iv.88), from Magadha (J.v.161), and from the Sivi country (J.v.210).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The students in the university studied the three Vedas and the eighteen sciences (vijjá) (J.i.159), which evidently included the science of archery (J.i.356; DhA.iv.66; also medicine and surgery, Vin.i.269f), the art of swordmanship (J.v.128), and elephant-craft (hatthi-sutta) (J.ii.47). Mention is also made of the study of magic, such as the Álambanamanta, for charming snakes (J.iv.457), and the Nidhiuddharanamanta, for recovering </data>
<data>buried treasure (J.iii.116). The students were also taught the science of ritual (manta) (J.ii.200); but in this branch of learning Benares seems to have had a greater reputation, for we find students being sent there from Takkasilá in order to learn the mantas (DhA.iii.445).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The students generally paid a fee to the teacher on admission, the usual amount being one thousand gold pieces. They waited on the teacher by day and were taught by him at night. The paying students were entitled to various privileges, and lived with the teacher as members of his family, enjoying his constant company. The students seem mostly to have done their own domestic work, leading a co-operate life, gathering their own firewood and cooking their meals, though mention is made of servants, both male and female, helping in the various tasks (J.i.319).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only bráhmanas and khattiyas appear to have been eligible for admission to Takkasilá (J.iv.391).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discipline was evidently very rigorous, a breach of the rules being severely punished, irrespective of the status of the pupil, who was sometimes flogged on the back with a bamboo stick (J.ii.277f). Often the most promising students were given the daughters of the teachers in marriage as a mark of very special favour. (E.g., DhA.iv.66. Elsewhere (J.vi.347) it is stated that the teacher's daughter was given to the eldest pupil). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the teacher and his pupils were invited to a meal at the house of a chief man of the city (J.iv.391). The principal teacher was called Disápámokkhácariya; under him were assistants, usually chosen from among his students, who were called pitthiácariyá (E.g., J.ii.100).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Takkasilá, being the capital of Gandhára, was probably also the seat of government. Bimbisára's contemporary in Gandhára </data>
<data>was Pukkusáti (J.i.399; ii.218). Mention is made in the Játakas of a Takkasilá-rájá (AA.i.153; MA.i.335; ii.979, 987f). According to the Kumbhakára Játaka (q.v.), Takkasilá was the capital of Naggaji. The Dípavamsa (iii.31) records that twelve kings, descendants of Dípankara, ruled in succession at Takkasilá.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is said in the Divyávadána (p.371) that Bindusára's empire included Takkasilá. There was once a rebellion there and Asoka was sent to quell it. From the minor Rock Edict II. of Asoka it would appear that Takkasilá was the headquarters of a provincial government at Gandhára, placed under a Kumára or Viceroy. A rebellion broke out there again in the time of Asoka, who sent his son Kunála to settle it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Takkasilá is identified with the Greek Taxila, in Rawalpindi in the Punjab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

One day, another horse was washed in the place reserved for the king's state charger, who, when taken there to bathe, refused to enter. The Bodhisatta, divining the reason, directed that the horse should be taken elsewhere, and not always bathed in the same spot, adding that a man will tire even of the daintiest food, if it never be changed. The Bodhisatta was amply rewarded for his skill in reading the horse's thoughts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to a monk, a disciple of Sáriputta. He had been a goldsmith and the meditation on impurity, prescribed for him by Sáriputta, proved impossible for him. He was taken to see the Buddha, who asked him to gaze at a lotus in a pond near by. The monk saw the lotus fade and, developing insight, became an arahant. He marvelled at the Buddha's power of reading the thoughts and temperaments of others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The monk is identified with the state charger and Ananda with the king.

The monkey-king had the habit of gelding with his teeth all his male offspring, lest they should one day supersede him; but the Bodhisatta's mother left the herd before the child was born and brought him up elsewhere. When he grew up he came to see the monkey-king, and on the latter's trying to kill him by crushing him in a false embrace, the Bodhisatta showed greater strength than his sire. Then Devadatta asked him to fetch lotuses from a neighbouring lake, which was inhabited by an ogre, saying that he wished to crown his son as king. The Bodhisatta guessed the presence of the ogre and plucked the flowers by leaping several times from one bank to the other, grasping them on his way. The ogre seeing this expressed his admiration, saying that those who combine the three qualities of dexterity, valour, and resource can never be vanquished. When the monkey-king saw his son returning with the ogre, who was carrying the flowers, he died of a broken heart. The story was related in reference to hunting.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Tapodá&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A large lake below the Vebhára mountain, outside Rájagaha. The lake was cool, but the stream flowing from it, also called Tapodá (Vin.iii.108; iv.116f; DA.i.35; UdA.110), was hot. Around it was the Tapodáráma (q.v.). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is said (SA.i.30f; Sp.ii.512) that the water of the river was hot because it flowed between two Lohakumbhi-nirayas, which existed under Rájagaha. The lake was the playground of the Nágas who dwelt at the foot of the Vebhára mountain. Monks and recluses were evidently in the habit of going to the Tapodá to bathe in the hot springs. Thus, we find Samiddhi being questioned by a deity as he dried himself after bathing in the Tapodá (S.i.8ff; M.iii.192ff; J.ii.56), and the Anguttara Nikáya (v.196f) records a discussion between Ananda and the paribbájaka Kokanuda, on the banks of the Tapodá, where they had gone to bathe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Takkala Játaka (No.446)&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once in a village lived a man called Vasitthaka, an only son, who looked after his father with great devotion, until the latter, much against the wishes of his son, found a wife for him. A son was born to the pair and, when seven years old, he overheard his mother planning to have the old man taken by a ruse to the cemetery and there killed and buried in a pit. The next morning, when his father set out in a cart for the cemetery, the child insisted on accompanying him. Having watched his father dig a pit, he asked what it was for, and was told that the useless old man was a burden to keep and that the pit was for him. The boy was silent, and when his father stopped to have a rest, he took up the spade and began to dig another hole. On being asked the reason, he said it was for his father when he should be too old to be supported. This remark opened Vasitthaka's eyes; he returned home and drove away his wife. He afterwards took her back on her promising to give up her treacherous ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related to a man who had looked after his father; but the wife, whom he took at his father's wish, wanted to get rid of the old man, and suggested the idea to her husband. But his answer was that if she found the house inconvenient she could go elsewhere. The Buddha said that the characters of both stories were identical, and that he himself was the lad of the atítavatthu. J.iv.43-50.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

The king of Benares, fleeing from his enemies, arrived at Tirítavaccha's hermitage, riding on an elephant. Looking for water but finding none, he let himself down into the hermit's well but was unable to get out again; the hermit rescued him and showed him every hospitality. Later the hermit visited the king, now restored to the throne, and was given a dwelling place in the royal park. The courtiers were inclined to be jealous of the attentions paid to the hermit, but the king told them of the incident in the forest and they acknowledged the hermit's claim to honour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to Ananda having received five hundred robes from the women of Pasenadi's palace.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Tambapanni&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The name given to that district in Ceylon where Vijaya landed after leaving Suppáraka (Mhv.vi.47; Dpv.ix.30). It is said to have been so called because when Vijaya's followers, having disembarked from the ship, sat down there, wearied, resting their hands on the ground, they found them coloured by the red dust that lay there. Later on Vijaya founded his capital in Tambapanni, and following that the whole island came to bear the same name (Dpv.vii.38-42). Tambapanni was originally inhabited by Yakkhas, having their capital at Sirísavatthu (q.v.). The Valáhassa Játaka (J.ii.129) speaks of a Tambapannisara. According to the Samyutta Commentary (ii.83; but in VbhA.p.444 it is spoken of as tiyojana satika), the Tambapannidípa was one hundred leagues in extent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anurádhapura formed the Majjhimadesa in Tambapannidípa, the rest being the Paccantimadesa (AA.i.265).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Asoka's Rock Edicts II. and XIII. Tambapanni is mentioned as one of the Pratyanta desas, together with Coda, Pándya, Satiyaputta, Keralaputta, and the realm of Antiyaka Yonarája, as an unconquered territory with whose people Asoka was on friendly terms. Vincent Smith (Asoka (3rd edn.), p.163; but see Ind. Antiq., 1919, p.195f ) identifies this, not with Ceylon, but with the river Támraparni in Tinnevelly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Takkárika) (No.481)&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brahmadatta had, as chaplain, a tawny-brown brahmin who was toothless, and whose wife had a paramour possessed of the same attributes. Wishing for the death of the latter, the chaplain asked the king to build anew the southern gate of his city, and declared that on the day the gate was set up a tawny-brown brahmin should be killed and sacrificed to the guardian spirits. The king agreed, but the chaplain, unable to restrain his wife's conduct, told her about it. The news spread abroad, and all tawny-brown brahmins fled from the city, leaving, on the auspicious day, only the chaplain. The people demanded that he should be slain to avert ill-luck, and that his pupil, Takkáriya (the Bodhisatta), should be appointed in his place. The chaplain confessed his plan to Takkáriya, who thereupon related several stories showing how &quot;silence is golden.&quot; In the end Takkáriya allowed the chaplain to flee from the city, and had the corpse of a goat buried under the city gates in the dead of night (J.iv.242ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related in reference to Kokálika, who came to grief by abusing the Chief Disciples. See Kokálika (2).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tawny-brown brahmin is identified with Kokálika.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Játaka seems also to have been called the Takka Játaka (E.g., J.v.446) and the Mahátakkári Játaka.

Foreseeing danger to the prince from his son, he taught the prince four stanzas to be repeated when his son should be sixteen years old, at the evening meal, at the time of the great levee, while ascending the palace roof, and in the royal chamber respectively. The prince in due course became king, and, as had been foreseen by his teacher, he was conspired against by his son, but saved his life by repeating the stanzas. The son was cast into prison, and set free only after the king's death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related in reference to Bimbisára's great love for Ajátasattu, though soothsayers had predicted that the latter would kill his father (J.iii.121ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

With a company of five hundred men, he gave dramatic performances of great splendour in towns and villages and in royal courts, and won much fame and favour. One day he visited the Buddha and asked if it was true that players who delight large audiences are reborn among the gods of laughter. Three times the Buddha refused to answer, but in the end allowed himself to be persuaded, and told Tálaputa that those who induce sensual states in others will be reborn in purgatory. Tálaputa wept to think that older actors should so have deceived him in telling him of their theories, and, having heard the Buddha preach, entered the Order and soon became an arahant (S.iv.306ff; Thag.1091-1145; ThagA.ii.155ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Samyutta Commentary (SA.iii.100) says he obtained his name from his bright and cheerful colour, like that of a ripe palm-fruit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

His father was the headman of the village Kitti in Rohana, and Theraputtábhaya, when sixteen, wielded a club thirty-eight inches round and sixteen cubits long. He was therefore sent to Kákavannatissa's court. Abhaya's father was a supporter of Mahásumma and, having heard a discourse from him, became a Sotápanna, entered the Order and soon afterwards became an arahant. His son, thereupon, came to be called Theraputtábhaya (Mhv.xxiii.2, 63ff). At the end of Dutthagámani's campaigns, Abhaya took leave of the king and joined the Order, became an arahant, and lived with five hundred other arahants (Mhv.xxvi.2). When Dutthagámani lay on his deathbed Abhaya visited him and gladdened his heart by reminding him of the works of great merit he had done (Mhv.xxxii.48ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a previous birth he had given milk-rice to monks, hence his great strength (MT.453).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Suppabuddha, a banker of Rájagaha, having seen the Pacceka Buddha on his way to a park, spoke insultingly to him, and, as a result, was born as a leper in this birth. (Ud.v.3; UdA.291; DhA. (ii.36) says Suppabuddha spat on the Pacceka Buddha).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Samyutta Nikaya (i.92f; SA.i.126f; also J.iii.299f and MT.597) contains the story of a man who often met Tagarasikhí begging for alms. One day, being attracted by him, he asked his wife to give him a meal and went on his way. His wife prepared excellent food and gave it to Tagarasikhí. The husband met Tagarasikhí on his way back to the town, and seeing the excellence of the food, was displeased with his wife's generosity, thinking to himself that it were better that slaves and workmen should have eaten the food. As a result, he was born as a very rich setthi in Sávatthi, but was never able to enjoy his wealth, and died intestate, all his possessions passing to the royal treasury. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dhammapada Commentary (iv.77f) calls him Aputtaka. It has been suggested (Bud. India, p.31) that the &quot;Tagara&quot; in Tagarasikhí was the name of a place, perhaps the modern Ter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

They were adopted by an old woman of a village near Benares and were called Mahátundila and Cullatundila. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The woman loved them like her own children and refused to sell them, but, one day, some lewd men made her drunk and she agreed to sell Cullatundila. When Cullatundila discovered this, he ran to his brother, but the latter preached to him how it was the fate of pigs to be slaughtered for their flesh; he should, therefore, meet his death bravely. All Benares heard the Bodhisatta's preaching, and flocked to the spot. The king adopted the pigs as his sons and Mahátundila was appointed to the seat of judgment. On the king's death, he wrote a book of law for the guidance of future generations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related in reference to a monk who was in constant terror of the thought of death.

He was the Buddha's brother and, having renounced the household, became an ascetic. On hearing that Kassapa had become Buddha, he visited him but expressed great disappointment on discovering that he ate flesh food (ámagandha). The Buddha taught him that ámagandha was not really flesh but the kilesas which corrupt the heart, and he preached to him the Ámagandha Sutta. Tissa immediately entered the Order and became an aggasávaka (Bu.xxv.39; SNA.i.280-2, 293; D.ii.4). Tissa's father was born as Subhadda in this age. Ap.i.101.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;6.

Tissa lived in Sávatthi and when his elder brother died, he went home and was persuaded by his relations to return to the lay life. Later, Metteyya, passing through the village with the Buddha, during a journey, visited Tissa and brought him once more to the Buddha. The Buddha preached to </data>

Tissa.&lt;/b&gt;-The personal name of Metteyya, friend of Tissa (7). Metteyya was his gotta-name by which he became known (SNA.ii.536; NidA.184). In the Sutta Nipáta (vs.814) he is called Tissa-Metteyya.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;9. Tissa-Metteyya.&lt;/b&gt;-A disciple of Bávarí. He visited the Buddha with his colleagues and when the Buddha answered his questions, he, and his thousand pupils became arahants. Tissa was his personal name and Metteyya that of his clan. SN., vs.1040-2; SNA.ii.588.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;10. Tissa.&lt;/b&gt;-An Elder of Sávatthi. He once received a length of coarse cloth as a gift and handed it to his sister to be made into a robe. She had the cloth pounded and spun into fine yarn and made of it a soft robe-cloth. At first Tissa would not accept it but was prevailed upon to do so and had it made into a soft robe by skilled robe-makers. He died on the night it was finished and, as a result of his fancy for it, was reborn as a louse in the robe. After his death, the monks wished to divide the robe but the louse started shouting. The Buddha, hearing this by his power of divine audience, asked the monks to lay the robe aside for seven days. At the end of that period, the louse was reborn in the Tusita world. DhA.iii.341ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;11. Tissa.&lt;/b&gt;-A monk. When the Buddha declared that in four months he would pass away, many monks were greatly excited, collecting in groups, not knowing what to do. But Tissa remained aloof, determined to win arahantship before the Buddha's death. The others, misunderstanding him, reported to the Buddha that Tissa had no love for him, but the Buddha, having questioned him, praised his earnestness. DhA.iii.267f.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
<data>&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;12. Tissa Thera.&lt;/b&gt;-An arahant. He belonged to a brahmin family of Rájagaha and, having attained great proficiency in the Vedas, became a teacher of five hundred young men. When the Buddha visited Rájagaha, Tissa was so struck by his majesty that he joined the Order, later winning arahantship. The Theragáthá contains verses uttered by him regarding certain monks who were jealous of his great renown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Piyadassí Buddha, Tissa was an ascetic. Seeing the Buddha in samádhi in a forest-grove, he built over him an arbour of silo flowers and for seven days paid him homage. (Thag.vv.153-4; ThagA.i.272f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is evidently identical with Sálamandapiya of the Apadána (ii.431f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;13. Tissa.&lt;/b&gt;-A rájá of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/r/roruka')"&gt;Roruva&lt;/a&gt;. He was an &quot;unseen&quot; ally of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bimbisara')"&gt;Bimbisára&lt;/a&gt; and, as such, sent him various gifts. The king sent him in return a painted panel on which was depicted the life of the Buddha and a gold plate specially inscribed with the&lt;a href="http://www.palikanon.com/english/wtb/n_r/paticca_samuppaada')"&gt;Paticcasamuppáda&lt;/a&gt;. On seeing these, Tissa's mind was filled with agitation and, giving up his title, he came to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/r/raajagaha')"&gt;Rájagaha&lt;/a&gt; as a monk and lived in the&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sappasondika')"&gt;Sappasondika&lt;/a&gt; cave, from there visiting the Buddha, and soon afterwards becoming an arahant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Vipassí Buddha he was a chariot-maker and gave the Buddha a stool made of sandalwood. Fifty-seven kappas ago he was four times king under the name of Santa (Bhavanimmita) (Thag.97; ThagA.i.199f). He is probably identical with Phalakadáyaka of the Apadána (i.174).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a name="14"&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;. Tissa Thera.&lt;/b&gt;-An arahant. Son of the </data>
<data>Buddha's paternal aunt, Amitá. He entered the Order and dwelt in a woodland settlement, but he was proud of his rank and irritable and captious in his conduct. He once came to the Buddha in tears because his colleagues had teased him on account of his talkativeness (S.ii.282; MA.i.289). On another occasion, the Buddha, with his celestial eye, saw Tissa sleeping with open mouth during the siesta and, sending a ray of glory, woke him. Tissa's heart was filled with anguish and when he confessed to his colleagues his mental laziness and distaste for religion, they brought him to the Buddha. The Buddha preached to him the Tissa Sutta, at the end of which he became an arahant (Thag.v.39; but see v.1162; S.iii.106f; ThagA.i.105).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Tissa Buddha he swept the leaves from the foot of the Bodhi-tree. He is evidently identical with Bodhisammajjaka of the Apadána (Ap.ii.457f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dhammapada Commentary (i.31ff) calls him Thullatissa. He entered the Order when old and became fat through idleness. He spent most of his time in the Waiting-hall draped in rich robes. Monks, taking him for a Mahá Thera, begged the privilege of performing various services for him, such as massaging his feet. But when they discovered his attainments, they reviled him and he sought the Buddha. The Buddha, however, asked him to obtain their pardon for having failed to show them due honour, and when he refused, related to him the story of Nárada and Devala.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;15. Tissa.&lt;/b&gt;-A novice. He was a gatekeeper's son and, coming with some carpenters to Sávatthi, joined the Order. He was constantly finding fault with the food and other offerings, even those given by Anáthapindika, and he boasted of the riches enjoyed by his kinsfolk. His colleagues made enquiries and, discovering the truth about his antecedents, </data>
<data>reported him to the Buddha who preached the Katáhaka Játaka (q.v.) to show his similar tendencies in the past (DhA.iii.367). Tissa was identified with Katáhaka of the Játaka. J.i.455.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;16. Tissa.&lt;/b&gt;-A monk. He was called Kosambivásí Tissa. He spent the rainy season at Kosambí and, on his departure, his supporter gave him three robes and other offerings; he, however, refused them saying that he had no novice to look after them. The layman immediately gave his son, then seven years old, to be his novice. The boy attained arahantship in the Tonsure-hall. While on his way to Sávatthi to see the Buddha, Tissa accidentally blinded the novice by hitting his eye with a fan at dawn. The Elder was filled with remorse and, falling at the boy's feet, asked his pardon. But the answer was that there was no fault to pardon, the accident was due to samsára. When the matter was reported to the Buddha he said that such was the nature of arahants. They felt no resentment. At the end of the discourse, Tissa became an arahant (DhA.ii.182ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;17. Tissa.&lt;/b&gt;-A monk, called Asubhakammika-Tissa. He is mentioned in the Commentaries (VibhA.270) as an example of a good friend, devoted to the contemplation of asubha, association with whom helps one to get rid of lust. His teacher was Mahátissa of Kotapabbata-vihára. MT.553.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;18. Tissa.&lt;/b&gt;-A master of writing (lekhácariya). Even after his death he was known by reason of his writing. Mil., p.70; see J.R.A.S.xii.159.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;19. Tissa.&lt;/b&gt;-One of the chief lay patrons of Padumuttara Buddha. Bu.xi.26.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;20. Tissa.&lt;/b&gt;-A monk known as Áraddhavipassaka-Tissa. While walking about he saw a lotus open at the rising of the sun. Immediately afterwards, he heard a slave-girl singing; her song told of </data>
<data>how men are subject to death just as the lotus opens to the sun. Tissa thereupon developed insight and became an arahant. SNA.ii.397.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;21. Tissa.&lt;/b&gt;-Uncle of Pandukábhaya. He administered the kingdom when his elder brother, Abhaya, gave up the government. He was killed by Pandukábhaya. Mhv.x.51, 70.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;22. Tissa-&lt;a name="Kontiputta"&gt;Kontiputta&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;-An Elder of Asoka's time, a disciple of Mahávaruna and brother of Sumitta. He was the son of a kinnarí called Kuntí. He died of a bite by a venomous insect. Asoka was grieved on learning that Tissa's death was due to his failure to obtain ghee in his illness. Mhv.v.213ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;23. Tissa-kumára.&lt;/b&gt;-Brother of Asoka and his vice-regent. He once asked Asoka why monks were not joyful and gay and Asoka, in order to teach him the reason, gave him the throne for a week, saying that at the end of the week he would be put to death. Tissa then realised that monks, who had the constant consciousness of death, could not be merry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He later became a monk under Yonaka Mahádhammarakkhita and lived in the Asokáráma, where he prevented the murder of the theras by the minister sent by Asoka to make the monks hold the uposatha together. He became an arahant and, on account of his love of solitude, came to be known as Ekaviháriya. Thag.vv.537-46; ThagA.i.503f; Mhv.v.33, 60, 154ff, 241; SA.iii.125.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;24. Tissa.&lt;/b&gt;-King of Kalyáni and father of Viháramahádeví (Mhv.xxii.13ff). His brother Ayya-Uttika entered into an intrigue with the queen and was banished. He sent the queen a letter through an attendant to an arahant who was in the habit of visiting the palace. This letter fell into the hands of the king who suspected the arahant himself, owing to a similarity </data>
<data>in his writing to that of the intriguer. The king ordered the arahant to be killed and cast into the sea. The devas, being offended, caused the sea to overflow the land. The total destruction of the country was only averted by the king sending his daughter Deví (afterwards Viháramahadeví), to sea in a golden boat. The Rasaváhini, however, says he was thrown into a cauldron of boiling oil; see Telakatáhagáthá.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tissa's father was Mutasiva and his grandfather Uttiya. MT.431.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;25. Tissa.&lt;/b&gt;-A minister of Dutthagámani. When the latter fled from Saddhátissa, Tissa joined him and he gave him his own food during the flight. But the food was ultimately given to a monk (see Tissa 26) who accepted their invitation to the meal. (For details see Mhv.xxiv.22ff; AA.i.365). It was probably the mother of this Tissa who, we are told (Vsm., p.63), used a cloth worth one hundred to wipe away the impurities of her son's birth, which cloth she afterwards threw out on to the Tálaveli road hoping that it might prove useful to a pámsukúlika monk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;26. Tissa.&lt;/b&gt;-A thera in Piyangudípa. He it was who accepted the meal given by Dutthagámani while fleeing from his brother. Mhv.xxiv.25.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;27. Tissa.&lt;/b&gt;-A brahmin youth of Rohana who rebelled against Vattagámani in the fifth year of his reign. At that time Damilas invaded Ceylon and Vattagámani sent word to Tissa asking him to fight them, and take the throne for himself; Tissa did, but was conquered by them (Mhv.xxxiii.38ff). See also Bráhmana-Tissa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;28. Tissa&lt;/b&gt;.-A monk of Kambugallaka; he was very learned and helped to reconcile Vattagámani and his discontented ministers (Mhv.xxxiii.71, 75). Later, the ministers built several viháras - the </data>
<data>Múlavokása, the Sáliyáráma, the Pabbatáráma and the Uttaratissáráma - and handed them over to Tissa. Ibid., 91.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;29. Tissa.&lt;/b&gt;-A minister of Vattagámani; he built the Uttamtissáráma. Mhv.xxxiii.91.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;30. Tissa.&lt;/b&gt;-Son of Mahácúla and king of Ceylon (9-12 A.D.). He was poisoned by his wife Anulá. Mhv.xxxiv.15ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;31. Tissa.&lt;/b&gt;-A paramour of Queen Anulá. He was a wood-carrier and was therefore called Dárubhatika-Tissa. He reigned for one year and one month and built a bathing-tank in the Mahámeghavana. He was poisoned by Anulá. Mhv.xxxiv.22ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;32. Tissa.&lt;/b&gt;-A monk of the Dakkhináráma, for whom Mahásena built the Jetavana-vihára. Mhv.xxxvii.32, 38.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;33. Tissa.&lt;/b&gt;-Younger son of Mahádáthika-Mahánága and brother of Amandagámani Abhaya. He was known as &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kanirajaanu_tissa')"&gt;Kanirajánu-tissa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. Mhv.xxxv.11ff; MT.640.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;34. Tissa&lt;/b&gt;.-Nephew of Khallátanága and son of Sumanadeví, step-sister to the king. With his brothers, Abhaya and Uttara, he conspired to kill the king. But the conspiracy failed and they committed suicide. MT.612.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;35. Tissa.&lt;/b&gt;-An artisan (kammáraputta), a previous incarnation of Sáliya. He lived in Mundagangá and receiving one day as wages the flesh of a boar, he had it cooked by his wife. When the meal was ready he announced alms; the theras Dhammadinna, Godhiya-Mahátissa, Mahánága of Samuddavihára, Mahánága of Kálavallimandapa, Mahásangharakkhita, Dhammagutta, Mahánága of Bhátiyavanka and Maliyamahádeva appeared to accept the alms. MT.605f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;36. Tissa.&lt;/b&gt;-A monk resident in Lonagiri (Lenagiri). </data>
<data>He once saw fifty monks, on their way to Nágadipa on a pilgrimage, returning from their alms-rounds in Mahákhíragáma, with their bowls empty. Asking them to wait, he returned in a little while with his bowl of milk rice which proved more than enough for the whole company. Seeing their astonishment, he explained that since he had begun to practise the sáráníya-dhammá, his bowl had never lacked food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Giribhandamahápújá at Cetiyapabbata, Tissa wished to have for himself two shawls, the most precious things there. He declared his wish in the presence of others and the king, on being informed, determined that Tissa should not have them, but every time he put out his hand to take the robes, they slipped away, and others took their place. In the end the robes were given to Tissa (DA.ii.534f; MA.i.545).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;37. Tissa&lt;/b&gt;.-A Thera of Sávatthi, better known as Kutumbiyaputta-Tissa. He renounced forty crores of wealth and became a monk dwelling in the forest. His younger brother's wife sent five hundred ruffians to kill him. He begged them to spare his life for one night and broke his thigh-bone with a stone as token that he would not attempt to escape. During the night he overcame his pain and, dwelling on his virtues, became an arahant (MA.i.188f; DA.iii.747; Vsm.48).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;38. Tissa.&lt;/b&gt;-A Thera of Sáketa. He refused to answer questions, saying that he had no time. On being asked, &quot;Can you find time to die?&quot; he felt ashamed, and going to the Kanikáraválikasamudda-vihára, instructed monks of varying grades during the rainy season, rousing great enthusiasm among the populace by his preaching (MA.i.350f; DA.iii.1061).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;39. Tissa.&lt;/b&gt;-A monk of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kotapabbata')"&gt;Kotapabbata&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
<data>&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;40. Tissa.&lt;/b&gt;-A minister. The scholiast to the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kanha_jat_29_440')"&gt;Kanha Játaka&lt;/a&gt; mentions a story of an amacca called Tissa who, in a rage, killed his wife and all his retinue and, finally, himself. J.iv.11.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;41. Tissa.&lt;/b&gt;-A novice of Pañcaggalalena. While travelling through the air he heard the daughter of the artisan of Girigáma singing, after having bathed with her companions in a lotus-pond. Being attracted by the sound, he lost his power of travelling through the air. MA.i.353; SNA.i.70.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;42. Tissa.&lt;/b&gt;-A novice of Tissamahá-vihára. He complained to his teacher of his distaste for the Order and the latter took him to Cittalapabbata. There, with great effort, Tissa built for himself a cave and while lying there during the night, became an arahant, dying the next day. A thúpa called the Tissa-thera-cetiya was erected over his relics and this was still in existence in Buddhaghosa's day (MA.i.312f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;43. Tissa.&lt;/b&gt;-An attendant of King Saddhá-Tissa. The king, wishing to eat pheasants, asked Tissa to procure some, having first tested him by threatening to have him executed if he refused to kill fowl for the king's table. Tissa, even when led to the executioner's block, refused to kill the birds. The king was thus satisfied that Tissa would not kill pheasants for him. The next day, Tissa, seeing a fowler hawking some dead pheasants, obtained them for the king (SA.iii.49ff; AA.i.262).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;44.

Tissa.&lt;/b&gt; A sámanera of Tissa-vihára in Mahágáma. See Kundalá.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;46. Tissa.&lt;/b&gt; A novice who later became a devaputta on a tree near Nága-vihára. For details see Ras.ii.168.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;47. Tissa.&lt;/b&gt; A monk who, when his brother's wife sent men to kill him, broke his thigh bones as token he would not run away, and having begged leave for one night, attained arahantship.

In the time of Vipassí Buddha he was a householder in Bandhumatí, where he tended his blind parents. Being prevented by his parents' affliction from joining the Order, he repeated the Three Refuges under a monk, named Nisabha, and honoured them throughout his life of one hundred thousand years.

The Mahámeghavanáráma is also sometimes called the Tissamaháráma (E.g., Mhv.xx.25), and Tissáráma (Mhv.xv.174, 179, 203). Dappula gave to the Tissamahá-vihára the village of Kattikapabbata (Cv.xiv.59).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buddhaghosa says (DA.ii.581) that in his time all monks living in Ceylon, south of the Maháválukanadí, assembled there twice a year, on the first and last day of the vassa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>
