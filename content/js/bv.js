dbv.push("Venerable Tissa, the Lord's nephew, spoke to a number of monks and said: &quot;Friends, my body is as if drugged, things have become dim to my eyes, and the Dhamma is no longer clear to me.

I waver in the teachings.<br>So, those monks went to the Lord and told him what Tissa had said, and the Lord said to one monk: &quot;Go, monk, and in my name tell Tissa to come and speak to me.&quot; So he went, and when Tissa came, the Lord said to him: &quot;Is it true as they say that your body is as if drugged, that things have become dim to your eyes and that the Dhamma is no longer clear to you? That sloth and laziness possess your mind, that you live the holy life without joy, and that you waver in the teachings?&quot;<br>&quot;That is true, Lord.&quot;<br>&quot;Now, concerning this, what do you think, Tissa?  In the body with lust, desire, affection, thirst, fever and craving, does there arise a condition of change and flux? Do grief, sorrow, suffering, lamentation and despair arise?&quot;<br>&quot;Yes, Lord.&quot;<br>&quot;And is it not the same with feeling, perception, mental constructs and consciousness?&quot;<br>&quot;Yes, Lord.&quot;<br>&quot;Well said, Tissa! Well said! Now, what do you think? In the body without lust, desire, affection, thirst, fever and craving, does there arise a condition of change and flux? Do grief, sorrow, suffering, lamentation and despair arise? <br>&quot;Surely not, Lord.&quot;<br>&quot;And is it the same with feeling, perception, mental constructs and consciousness?&quot;<br>&quot;It is, Lord&quot;<br>&quot;Well said, Tissa! Well said! Now, what do you think? Are the body, feeling, perception, mental constructs and consciousness permanent or impermanent?&quot;<br>&quot;Impermanent, Lord.&quot;<br>&quot;So, seeing this, the instructed noble disciple turns away from these five aggregates. Turning away from them, passions fade, and with the fading of passions, he is free and he knows: 'Rebirth is destroyed, the holy life has been lived, what has had to be done is done; there is no more of this.' <br>Suppose there are two men, one a skilled traveller and the other not. And the unskilled traveller asks the way from the skilled one. He replies: 'Yes, my good man, this is the way. Continue for a while and you will see a fork in the road; take the right hand path. Go on a little, and you will come to a forest. Continue for a while more, and you will come to a marshy swamp. Go a little further, and you will see a great cliff. Go a little further still, and you will see a beautiful stretch of open ground.' <br>I use this parable to illustrate my meaning, and this is the meaning. The man unskilled in travel represents ordinary people, and the man skilled in travel represents the Tathagata, the Noble One, the fully enlightened Buddha. The fork in the road is the state of wavering, the left fork being the false eightfold path and the right fork being the Noble Eightfold Path. The thick forest is ignorance, the marshy swamp is desires, and the great cliff is irritation and despair. The delightful stretch of open ground is Nirvana. So be of good cheer, Tissa! Be of good cheer! I will counsel you, I will support you, I will instruct you.&quot;");

So, any kind of body, feeling, perception, mental constructs or consciousness - whether past, present or future, whether gross or subtle, whether internal or external, whether inferior or superior, whether far or near - must with right understanding be regarded thus: 'This is not mine, this is not I, this is not myself.' When a noble disciple has heard this and sees this, he is detached from body, feeling, perception, mental constructs and consciousness. Being detached, passions fade, with the fading of passions he is free, and when he is free he knows he is free.

With the arising of that vision, the desire and attachment you had for the five clinging aggregates might go. <br>You might even think: 'For a long time I have been defrauded, deceived and cheated by the mind, by clinging to body, feeling, perception, mental constructs and consciouness. Conditioned by this clinging there was becoming; conditioned by becoming there was birth; conditioned by birth, old age, dying, grief, sorrow, suffering, lamentation and despair came into being. This is the origin of this whole mass of suffering.&quot;<br>And Magandiya said to the Lord: &quot;I have confidence that if the good Gotama were to teach me Dhamma, I could rise from my seat no longer blind.&quot;");
