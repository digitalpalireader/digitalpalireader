<h3>I. Talk on Wanderers (<i>Paribb&#257;jakakath&#257;</i>)</h3>
<p><span class='sutta_ref'><a id='paragraph-1' name='paragraph-1'>1.</a></span> Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Exalted One was travelling along the highway between R&#257;jagaha and N&#257;land&#257; together with a great company of bhikkhus, with about five hundred bhikkhus. At the same time the wanderer Suppiya was also travelling along the highway between R&#257;jagaha and N&#257;land&#257; together with his pupil, the youth Brahmadatta. Along the way, the wanderer Suppiya spoke in many ways in dispraise of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. But his pupil, the youth Brahmadatta, spoke in many ways in praise of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. Thus these two, teacher and pupil, followed closely behind the Exalted One and the company of bhikkhus, making assertions in direct contradiction to each other.</p>

<p><span class='sutta_ref'><a id='paragraph-2' name='paragraph-2'>2.</a></span> Then the Exalted One together with the company of bhikkhus entered the royal resthouse in the Ambala&#7789;&#7789;hika garden in order to pass the night. The wanderer Suppiya together with his pupil, the youth Brahmadatta, also entered the royal resthouse in the Ambala&#7789;&#7789;hika garden in order to pass the night. There, too, the wanderer Suppiya spoke in many ways in dispraise of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha, while his pupil Brahmadatta spoke in many ways in their praise. Thus these two, teacher and pupil, dwelt together making assertions in direct contradiction to each other.</p>

<p><span class='sutta_ref'><a id='paragraph-3' name='paragraph-3'>3.</a></span> When dawn broke a number of bhikkhus, after rising, assembled in the pavilion. As they sat together, the following conversation sprang up among them: "It is wonderful and marvellous, friends, how the Exalted One, he who knows and sees, the Worthy One, the perfectly enlightened Buddha, has so thoroughly penetrated the diversity in the dispositions of beings. For this wanderer Suppiya spoke in many ways in dispraise of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha, while his own pupil, the youth Brahmadatta, spoke in many ways in their praise. These two, teacher and pupil, followed closely behind the Exalted One and the company of bhikkhus, making assertions in direct contradiction to each other."</p>

<p><span class='sutta_ref'><a id='paragraph-4' name='paragraph-4'>4.</a></span> Then the Exalted One, realizing the turn their discussion had taken, entered the pavilion, sat down on the prepared seat, and addressed the bhikkhus: "What kind of discussion were you holding just now, bhikkhus? What was the subject of your conversation?"</p>

<p>The bhikkhus replied: "When dawn had broken, Lord, after rising we assembled in the pavilion. As we sat here, the following conversation sprang up among us: 'It is wonderful and marvellous friends, how the Exalted One, he who knows and sees, the Worthy One, the perfectly enlightened Buddha, has so thoroughly penetrated the diversity in the dispositions of beings. For this wanderer Suppiya spoke in many ways in dispraise of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha, while his own pupil, the youth Brahmadatta, spoke in many ways in their praise. These two, teacher and pupil, followed closely behind the Exalted One and the company of bhikkhus, making assertions in direct contradiction to each other.' This, Lord, was the conversation we were having when the Exalted One arrived."</p>

<p><span class='sutta_ref'><a id='paragraph-5' name='paragraph-5'>5.</a></span> "If, bhikkhus, others speak in dispraise of me, or in dispraise of the Dhamma, or in dispraise of the Sangha, you should not give way to resentment, displeasure, or animosity against them in your heart. For if you were to become angry or upset in such a situation, you would only be creating an obstacle for yourselves. If you were to become angry or upset when others speak in dispraise of us, would you be able to recognize whether their statements are rightly or wrongly spoken?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not, Lord."</p>

<p>"If, bhikkhus, others speak in dispraise of me, or in dispraise of the Dhamma, or in dispraise of the Sangha, you should unravel what is false and point it out as false, saying: 'For such and such a reason this is false, this is untrue, there is no such thing in us, this is not found among us.'</p>

<p><span class='sutta_ref'><a id='paragraph-6' name='paragraph-6'>6.</a></span> "And if, bhikkhus, others speak in praise of me, or in praise of the Dhamma, or in praise of the Sangha, you should not give way to jubilation, joy, and exultation in your heart. For if you were to become jubilant, joyful, and exultant in such a situation, you would only be creating an obstacle for yourselves. If others speak in praise of me, or in praise of the Dhamma, or in praise of the Sangha, you should acknowledge what is fact as fact, saying: 'For such and such a reason this is a fact, this is true, there is such a thing in us, this is found among us.'</p>

<h3>II. The Analysis of Virtue</h3>

<h4>1. The Short Section on Virtue (<i>C&#363;&#7735;as&#299;la</i>)</h4>

<p><span class='sutta_ref'><a id='paragraph-7' name='paragraph-7'>7.</a></span> "It is, bhikkhus, only to trifling and insignificant matters, to the minor details of mere moral virtue, that a worldling would refer when speaking in praise of the Tath&#257;gata. And what are those trifling and insignificant matters, those minor details of mere moral virtue, to which he would refer?</p>

<p><span class='sutta_ref'><a id='paragraph-8' name='paragraph-8'>8.</a></span> "'Having abandoned the destruction of life, the recluse Gotama abstains from the destruction of life. He has laid aside the rod and the sword, and dwells conscientious, full of kindness, compassionate for the welfare of all living beings.' It is in this way, bhikkhus, that the worldling would speak when speaking in praise of the Tath&#257;gata.</p>

<p>"Or he might say: 'Having abandoned taking what is not given, the recluse Gotama abstains from taking what is not given. Accepting and expecting only what is given, he dwells in honesty and rectitude of heart.'</p>

<p>"Or he might say: 'Having abandoned unchaste living, the recluse Gotama lives the life of chastity. He dwells remote (from women), and abstains from the vulgar practice of sexual intercourse.'</p>

<p><span class='sutta_ref'><a id='paragraph-9' name='paragraph-9'>9.</a></span> "Or he might say: 'Having abandoned false speech, the recluse Gotama abstains from falsehood. He speaks only the truth, he lives devoted to truth; trustworthy and reliable, he does not deceive anyone in the world.'</p>

<p>"Or he might say: 'Having abandoned slander, the recluse Gotama abstains from slander. He does not repeat elsewhere what he has heard here in order to divide others from the people here, nor does he repeat here what he has heard elsewhere in order to divide these from the people there. Thus he is a reconciler of those who are divided and a promoter of friendships. Rejoicing, delighting, and exulting in concord, he speaks only words that are conducive to concord.'</p>

<p>"Or he might say: 'Having abandoned harsh speech, the recluse Gotama abstains from harsh speech. He speaks only such words as are gentle, pleasing to the ear, endearing, going to the heart, urbane, amiable, and agreeable to many people.'</p>

<p>"Or he might say: 'Having abandoned idle chatter, the recluse Gotama abstains from idle chatter. He speaks at the right time, speaks what is factual, speaks on the good, on the Dhamma and the Discipline. His words are worth treasuring: they are timely, backed by reason, definite and connected with the good.'</p>

<p><span class='sutta_ref'><a id='paragraph-10' name='paragraph-10'>10.</a></span> "Or he might say: 'The recluse Gotama abstains from damaging seed and plant life. He eats only in one part of the day, refraining from food at night and from eating at improper times. He abstains from dancing, singing, instrumental music, and witnessing unsuitable shows. He abstains from wearing garlands, embellishing himself with scents, and beautifying himself with unguents. He abstains from accepting gold and silver. He abstains from accepting uncooked grain, raw meat, women and girls, male and female slaves, goats and sheep, fowl and swine, elephants, cattle, horses and mares. He abstains from accepting fields and lands. He abstains from running messages and errands. He abstains from buying and selling, and from dealing with false weights, false metals, and false measures. He abstains from the crooked ways of bribery, deception, and fraud. He abstains from mutilating, executing, imprisoning, robbery, plunder, and violence.'</p>

<p>"It is in this way, bhikkhus, that the worldling would speak when speaking in praise of the Tath&#257;gata.</p>

		<dd>The explanations of these games are drawn from the commentary.</dd><dt><a href='#fnt-2' name='fn-2' id='fn-2'>2</a>.</dt>
		<dd><i>Tiracch&#257;nakath&#257;</i>, often rendered "animal talk"; however, the commentary explains it as "talk which, because it does not lead to emancipation, runs horizontal to the (upward leading) paths to heaven and liberation" (<i>aniyy&#257;nikath&#257;   saggamokkhamagg&#257;na&#7747; tiracch&#257;nabh&#363;t&#257; kath&#257;</i>). An animal, <i>tiracch&#257;nagata</i>, is called so because it moves horizontally with the earth, in contrast to man, who walks erect. But talk that moves horizontally is pointless or frivolous talk, not animal talk. Besides, animals cannot speak.</dd><dt><a href='#fnt-3' name='fn-3' id='fn-3'>3</a>.</dt>
		<dd>Improper ways of gaining material support from donors, discussed in detail in Vism 1.61&#8211;82.</dd><dt><a href='#fnt-4' name='fn-4' id='fn-4'>4</a>.</dt>
		<dd>The explanation of these arts, usually indicated by a single obscure word in the text, is drawn from the commentary.</dd><dt><a href='#fnt-5' name='fn-5' id='fn-5'>5</a>.</dt>
		<dd>Words in square brackets appear in the Burmese, but not in the Roman or the Sinhalese editions of the Sutta.</dd><dt><a href='#fnt-6' name='fn-6' id='fn-6'>6</a>.</dt>
		<dd><i>Samva&#7789;&#7789;a-viva&#7789;&#7789;a</i>. These are the two primary divisions of the great aeon (<i>mah&#257;kappa</i>). The <i>samva&#7789;&#7789;akappa</i> is the period between the full evolution of a world system and its complete dissolution, the <i>viva&#7789;&#7789;akappa</i> the period between dissolution and full evolution. The PED definitions should be reversed; see Vism 13.28&#8211;30. Since each period contains a phase of incipient development and a phase of stabilization, the two are further divided to yield four <i>asa&#7749;kheyyakappas</i>, "incalculable aeons," in a great aeon. See A 4:166.</dd><dt><a href='#fnt-7' name='fn-7' id='fn-7'>7</a>.</dt>
		<dd>The "world of streaming radiance," the sixth of the fifteen planes in the fine-material world (<em>r&#363;paloka</em>), the lowest order to be exempt from the onset of world destruction. The Brahma-world mentioned later is destroyed by the conflagration but reappears at an early stage.</dd><dt><a href='#fnt-8' name='fn-8' id='fn-8'>8</a>.</dt>
		<dd><i>Ant&#257;nantik&#257;</i>, lit. "finitizers and infinitizers." The word "extensionists" is borrowed from Rhys-Davids.</dd><dt><a href='#fnt-9' name='fn-9' id='fn-9'>9</a>.</dt>
		<dd>Or "eel-wriggling," as rendered by Rhys-Davids. For the commentarial justification for this rendering, see below.</dd><dt><a href='#fnt-10' name='fn-10' id='fn-10'>10</a>.</dt>
		<dd>This might have been translated "doctrines of conscious survival" to accord with common idiom, but I have used a more literal rendering to maintain consistency with the commentarial explanation.</dd><dt><a href='#fnt-11' name='fn-11' id='fn-11'>11</a>.</dt>
		<dd>In order to avoid excessive repetition, the following section of the P&#257;li has been combined with the present section by deleting its repetition of each view and adding its novel feature, the declaration that the experience of feeling without contact is impossible, to the end of each statement in the present section.</dd></dl>
